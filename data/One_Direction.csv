I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen, and can't breathe

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn with Liam]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus: All]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all

Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
[Chorus: All, Harry, Liam]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Is disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Ooh

[Bridge: Zayn]
Going out tonight, changes into something red, her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

[Chorus: All, Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby

It will never change, me and youYou might also likeEmbed"

And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

Now, girl, I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was
You've almost had enough
And your actions speak louder than words
And you're about to break from all you've heard
But, don't be scared, I ain't going nowhere

I'll be here, by your side
No more fears, no more crying
But if you walk away, I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: All & Harry]
(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes

[Drop: Harry]
Even when the night changes
Even when the night changes

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We crossed paths like an intersection (Yeah)

I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

[Chorus: Harry]
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I

[Verse 2: Zayn, Niall and Liam & Louis, Niall and Liam]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us
You might also like[Chorus: Harry & Zayn]
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
(Two of us, two of us, two of us, two of us)
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end (Until the end)
Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between)
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us (Two of us)

Make a little conversation
So long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over
Told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark (Oh-oh)
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough? (Oh-oh)
Baby, we could be enough

[Chorus: All, Louis]
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way and I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home

[Verse 2: Niall, Louis]
So hot that I couldn't take it
Wanna wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling
I see the smile as it starts to creep in
It was there, I saw it in your eyes

You're turning heads when you walk through the door

Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else

But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately

I give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I look inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane
You could be preoccupied

But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard the girls say

Got to hold it in your hand

I might never be your knight in shinin' armour
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

[Verse 2: Niall]

Make a little conversation
So long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over
Told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark (Oh-oh)
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough? (Oh-oh)
Baby, we could be enough

[Chorus: All, Louis]
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way and I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home

[Verse 2: Niall, Louis]
So hot that I couldn't take it
Wanna wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling
I see the smile as it starts to creep in
It was there, I saw it in your eyes

Everybody wanna drag us down (Yeah)
Is it 'cause we look too happy? (Ah, yeah)
I'll never forget when you looked at me
And told me it was all mine
I remember that like yesterday
It was a summer night on the West Side
That was last summer, we had the best times, yeah
We crossed paths like an intersection (Yeah)
Now we both headed in one direction

Stuck in motion and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I said, ""You're on fire, babe""
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

[Chorus: All]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

""Do you believe I'll never be too far?""
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Ah-ooh, we had some good times, didn't we?
Ah-ooh, we had some good tricks up our sleeve
Ah-ooh, goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

And you will find me

In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand

I might never be your knight in shinin' armour
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

[Chorus: Harry, All]
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

[Verse 2: Niall]
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

Down to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen but the world still turns
Stuck in motion and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah

Lie awake, only hoping they're okay
I never counted all of mine

I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon

I said, ""You're on fire, babe""
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light
In her eyes, there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

[Chorus: All]
What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

Holdin' you back, don't let 'em tie you down
Whatever change is holdin' you back

I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I said, ""You're on fire, babe""
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

[Chorus: All]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

A week ago, you said to me
""Do you believe I'll never be too far?""
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Ah-ooh, we had some good times, didn't we?
Ah-ooh, we had some good tricks up our sleeve
Ah-ooh, goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

[Chorus: All]
And you will find me
Yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand

Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
[Chorus: All, Harry, Liam]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Is disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Ooh

[Bridge: Zayn]
Going out tonight, changes into something red, her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

[Chorus: All, Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes

There's a lightnin' in your eyes, I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat, runnin' out of time
Without you, I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright
There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
And every time I turn around, it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realise
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes, I know that I'll be fine

I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standin' out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So, I built you a house from a broken home
Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place
Every corner, callin' out your name
Tryna find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

[Verse 2: Liam, Harry, All]
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is runnin' in circles of you and me
Anyone in-between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're runnin' from
Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out

You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star

[Chorus: Harry, All]
And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

[Verse 2: Liam]
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see two feet in front of me

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: All, Harry]
(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis, Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn, All & Liam]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between
Let me hear you sing it

[Chorus: Harry & All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Verse 2: Niall & Liam]
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light up on the hill, yeah, yeah
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

There's a lightnin' in your eyes, I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat, runnin' out of time
Without you, I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright
There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
And every time I turn around, it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realise
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes, I know that I'll be fine

[Chorus: All]
This time, I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)
Escape from the city and follow the Sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standin' out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So, I built you a house from a broken home
Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place
Every corner, callin' out your name
Tryna find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

[Verse 2: Liam, Harry, All]
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is runnin' in circles of you and me
Anyone in-between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're runnin' from
Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: All, Harry]
(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis, Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet

Standin' out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So, I built you a house from a broken home
Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place
Every corner, callin' out your name
Tryna find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?

Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is runnin' in circles of you and me

Love was something you never heard enough

You're not a constant star

Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met

I get lost in your beauty and I can't see two feet in front of me

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: All, Harry]
(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis, Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet

Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

[Chorus: Harry]
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I

[Verse 2: Zayn, Niall and Liam & Louis, Niall and Liam]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together

Just touched down, you could never tell
Ow, big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh, but we don't listen

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn & All]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry & All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Verse 2: Niall & Liam]
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain

She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn & All]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry & All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Verse 2: Niall & Liam]
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

Is like chasing the clouds

Maybe they had to take some time

Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

[Chorus: Harry]
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I

[Post-Chorus: Harry]
Oh, you and I

[Verse 2: Zayn & Liam, Louis & Liam]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
But they never tried like us

And your eyes keep saying things

My mother told me I should go and get some therapy
I asked the doctor, ""Can you find out what is wrong with me?""
I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet
I can't control it, yeah, I know it's takin' over me

[Pre-Chorus: Liam, Zayn]
I'm going crazy, can't contain it
So tell me just what I should do

[Chorus: All]
She said, ""Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight""
She said, ""Hey, it's alright if it makes you feel alive""

[Verse 2: Niall]
Went to a party just after the doctor talked to me
I met a girl, I took her hand up to the balcony
I whispered somethin' in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said, ""Okay,"" but she was worried what her friends would think

[Pre-Chorus: Liam, Zayn]
She's going crazy, can't contain it
She asked me, ""What should I do?"" Oh

Kinda there, but not quite

With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain

But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change

My hands, your hands, tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to save it?
My heart, your heart, sit tight like bookends
Pages between us written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait till it's gone
You make me strong

[Chorus: All & Harry]
I'm sorry if I say I need you
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?

[Verse 2: Louis]
Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to

And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep

You never want to know how much you weight
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn & All]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry & All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Verse 2: Niall & Liam]
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright (Oh-oh-oh)

With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry, All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Bridge: Zayn]
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds

[Breakdown: Niall]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn & Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis, Harry, Harry & Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though It makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weight
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry & Niall]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things
[Bridge: Niall, Liam & Crowd]
You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you (I love you, Niall)
And you'll never treat yourself right, darling, but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I–, you sing (Love you, oh)

[Breakdown: Harry, Crowd, Niall]
'Cause I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth (Louder)
'Cause it's you, it's you, it's you, they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn & Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis, Louis & Harry, Harry, Harry & Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry & Niall]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to

[Verse 1: Harry]
Do you remember summer '09?
Wanna go back there every night
Just can't lie, was the best time of my life
Lyin' on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh, my, my, they could never shut us down

Why did I ever wanna let you go?
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered, I will always believe

Lately, I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head, I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Back in my head, we were kissing
I thought things were going alright (Alright, alright, alright)
With a sign on my back saying ""Kick me""

A game that I'm destined to lose

Said I'd never leave her, 'cause her hands fit like my T-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips

Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart, we can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start

I can't believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined?
Like branches on a tree or twigs caught on a vine
Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss
And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this
I'm just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world

Truly, madly, deeply, I am foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So, baby, say you'll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
In love with you

Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
And wake you up with all the words that I still haven't said?
And tender touches just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool, like it was no big deal?
Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
I'll put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
'Cause here’s the tragic truth, if you don't feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name

And truly, madly, deeply, I am foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So, baby, say you'll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you

I hope I'm not a casualty
Hope you won't get up and leave
Might not mean that much to you
But to me it's everything, everything

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Louis]

And somehow you kicked all my walls in

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say, ""They don't know

She's addicted to the feeling, never letting go, oh-woah (Let it go)

But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home, oh-woah (Take her home)

She closes the door

She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love

[Verse 2: Niall, Louis]
Maybe she's just tryna test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth (What you're worth)

""Don't get closer, he'll just break your heart""

Am I asleep, am I awake or somewhere in between?
I can't believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined?
Like branches on a tree or twigs caught on a vine
Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss
And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this
I'm just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world

[Chorus: All]
Truly, madly, deeply, I am foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So, baby, say you'll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
In love with you

[Verse 2: Liam, Zayn]
Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
And wake you up with all the words that I still haven't said?
And tender touches just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool, like it was no big deal?
Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
I'll put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
'Cause here’s the tragic truth, if you don't feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

Lately, I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head, I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would, I would

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would

[Verse 2: Niall, Liam, Louis]
Back in my head, we were kissing
I thought things were going alright (Alright, alright, alright)
With a sign on my back saying ""Kick me""
Reality ruined my life (Go Tommo, go!)
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend

Said I'd never leave her, 'cause her hands fit like my T-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?

[Chorus: All]
If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart, we can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn & Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis, Louis & Harry, Harry, Harry & Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry & Niall]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to

Won't go, won't go

Lately, I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head, I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would, I would

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would

[Verse 2: Niall, Liam, Louis]
Back in my head, we were kissing
I thought things were going alright (Alright, alright, alright)
With a sign on my back saying ""Kick me""
Reality ruined my life (Go Tommo, go!)
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend

Said I'd never leave her, 'cause her hands fit like my T-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips

Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart, we can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start

You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry
Wasn't ready to hear you say goodbye
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart
You're so London your own style, your own style
And together we're so good, so, girl, why
Are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart?
You're tearing me apart

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Did I do something stupid? Yeah, girl, if I blew it
Just tell me what I did, let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me like before

[Chorus: Harry, All]
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby, tell me how to make it right
Now, all of my friends say, it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on

And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep

You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

Lately, I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head, I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would

[Verse 2: Niall, Liam, Louis]
Back in my head, we were kissing
I thought things were going alright (Alright, alright, alright)
With a sign on my back saying ""Kick me""
Reality ruined my life (Go Tommo, go!)
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend

Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me

And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British

Yeah
Ooh, ooh

Can't believe you're packing your bags
Trying so hard not to cry
Had the best time, and now it's the worst time
But we have to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus 1: Harry]
Don't promise that you're gonna write
Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

[Chorus: Zayn]
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember

[Post-Chorus: Zayn, All]
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

[Verse 2: Louis]
Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind

She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low (Uh-huh)
She's addicted to the feeling, never letting go, oh-woah (Let it go)
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home, oh-woah (Take her home)

But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love

[Verse 2: Niall, Louis]
Maybe she's just tryna test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth (What you're worth)
And maybe all her friends have told her
""Don't get closer, he'll just break your heart""

Am I asleep, am I awake or somewhere in between?
I can't believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined?
Like branches on a tree or twigs caught on a vine
Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss
And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this
I'm just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world

[Chorus: All]
Truly, madly, deeply, I am foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So, baby, say you'll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
In love with you

[Verse 2: Liam, Zayn]
Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
And wake you up with all the words that I still haven't said?
And tender touches just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool, like it was no big deal?
Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
I'll put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
'Cause here’s the tragic truth, if you don't feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name

I'll say I'm fine
Midnight ain't no time for laughing
When you say goodbye

[Chorus: Zayn]
It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, irresistible

[Verse 2: Niall, Harry]
I've tried to ask myself, should I see someone else?
I wish I knew the answer
But I know, if I go now, if I leave, then I'm on my own tonight
I'll never know the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
Midnight doesn't last forever
Dark turns to light
Heartache flips my world around
I'm falling down, down, down, that's why

It's in your lips and in your kiss
It's in your touch and your fingertips
And it's in all the things and other things
That make you who you are
And your eyes, irresistible

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Louis, Liam]

Why don't you guys join in with us?
P-p-p-party time

[Verse 1: Harry]
I give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I look inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane
You could be preoccupied
Different date every night
You just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard the girls say

[Chorus: All, Louis]
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

[Verse 2: Liam]
You've got everythin' you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say

Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you, I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try
Heartbeats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

[Chorus: All]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I’ll find the words to say before you leave me today

[Verse 2: Niall & Louis]
Close the door, throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded, don't wanna be seen
Don’t wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded like tonight's sky
Hands are silent, voice is numb
Try to scream out, my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today

Flashing lights in my mind, going back to the time
Playing games in the street, kicking balls at my feet
There's a numb in my toes, standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes at the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall, make a joke of it all

[Chorus: All]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I’ll find the words to say before you leave me today
You know I’ll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time

I wanna hear you sing it as loud as you can, alright?
Does anyone know the name of this song?
""What Makes You Beautiful'
You said it, here we go, this is ""What Makes You Beautiful""

[Verse 1: Liam]
You’re insecure, don't know what for
You're turnin’ heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up (Sing it)
Bein' the way that you are is enough
Come on, Camden Roundhouse

[Pre-Chorus: Harry & Liam]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you (Sing it)

[Chorus: All, Harry & Liam]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets mе overwhelmed
But whеn you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I’m looking at you and I can’t believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don’t know you're beautiful, oh-oh

Heart beats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

Before you leavе me today

Close the door and throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded, don't wanna be seen

I'm broken, do you hear me?
I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see
I'm dancing alone, I'm praying
That your heart will just turn around

And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?

You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

[Pre-Chorus: Harry & Liam]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
(Come on, Bournemouth)

[Chorus: All, Harry & Liam]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

And your actions speak louder than words
And you're about to break from all you've heard

I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen, and can't breathe

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn with Liam]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus: All]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

[Verse 2: Niall with Zayn]
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Louis with Zayn]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus: All & Harry]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing (Woah, woah, woah)
You've got that one thing

[Bridge: Liam]
Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead

[Chorus: All, Zayn & Harry]
So get out, get out, get out of my head (Get out, get out, get out of my head, yeah)
And fall into my arms instead (Instead)
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing (I need that one thing)
So get out, get out, get out of my mind (Out of my mind)
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thingEmbed"
