[Verse 1]
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because

[Chorus]
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see (See)
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

When I cry like I'm a waterfall
And pour it out like alcohol
Would you raise your hands and catch it all?
Turn it to a swimming pool
When my blood is filled with cortisol

You can have a taste, but don't get too attached
One way ticket, baby, don't look back
All eyes on me, did you feel the impact?

Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me

Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense

Or wear ear condom next time

But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to

But I saw nothing there, no, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared while my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there, no, no, nothing

I heard one sine from above (Oh)

I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?

Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?

Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burqa

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, your father, brother
This family is stupid attractive

Keep it comin', I'm comin' around like your friend now

Everybody want that money, what you want?
High as hell, tryna have some fuckin' fun
I don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine (Shine)
Tried to kick it, just can't find the time

It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passin' 'em freaks (Bitch)

Smother 'em if you wanna be bad

[Verse 4: Twista]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
And I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by givin' money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe of a legacy of takin' her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista be goin' in warp speed, breakin' atoms
Blowin' O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me, now I got her
Because she be ready to party and then move to the club (Yes)
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talkin' about jewels and drugs

Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another (Not another word from you)
You're just an animal, tryna act real special (But deep down you are just a shrew)

'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine

I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting

Young, wild, American

Out of school go-go'n
For a hundred or two
Some asshole broke me in
Wrecked all my innocence

And this dance is on you

C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?
Rain on me a million
I'm not flawless, but I got a diamond heart

And can you go a little faster?!

Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight

I came down the mountain
Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way sayin' forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For somethin' he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

[Verse 2]
Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothin' more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap

Got you drippin' like no other

And can you go a little faster?!

Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'

(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Everyone tells him he should work a little harder
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
{Hey, man, get to work! Catch 'em!}
They all tell you that freedom must be bought
But baby, he's already caught 'em
So why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in

[Chorus]
Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out
Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future

Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

In the arms of the sacred?
Why do we pretend we're wrong?

Tryin' to get control

Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush

He has a funny way sayin' forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For somethin' he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you

She wants nothin' more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep

He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off

I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 2]
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

After the show, it's the afterparty

Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body, and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and (help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (with your body)
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life (you)
But do what you want with my body
(When I want, when I want, when I want)
Do what you want with my body
[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want with me

Do what you want with me

Do what you want with me

Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
And I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by givin' money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe of a legacy of takin' her to another place when I get it
Hold up

Blowin' O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me, now I got her
Because she be ready to party and then move to the club (Yes)
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talkin' about jewels and drugs

Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)

Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue

Are flown on beaches for public sight

Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said, ""Baby, why do we love each other?""
I said, ""Honey, it's simple, it's the way that you love and treat your mother""

[Chorus]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)
[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas
Just like the one I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm dreamin' of a white, white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may your days be so very merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Interlude]
So as you can tell, I'm very outgoing
And a little bit shy, but I decided that this song is just too short
It's such a beautiful Christmas song, but it's only one verse
So I added one extra one, here it goes

[Verse 2]
I'm dreamin' of a white snowman
With a carrot nose and charcoal eyes
Oh, and when he cries, I'm gonna tell him it's okay
Because Santa's on his sleigh and he's on his way
Oh-oh-oh, I'm, I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may all your days and your Thanksgivings be so bright
And may all, all your Christmases be white

I got a look at you

There ain't no reason you and me should be alone

I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby

One of my favorite memories with my grandpa and my grandma around Thanksgiving
And it's actually leading up to Christmas time
Is that they make these cookies called pizzelles
And if you're Italian, you know what those are
They're like really flat waffles, they're really thin and crisp
My grandpa would always make the pizzelles and he always worked the machine and everybody had to
""I got it, outta the way, outta the way, outta the way""
That was my grandfather's thing is he made the, the pizzelles, so
I don't know why, but right now, I'm just thinking about
Thinking about the Italian cookies

[Verse 2]
Another shot before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of somethin' final we call life tonight
Alright, alright
Put on your shades, I know you're dancin' the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
'Night, yeah, baby
Oh, it isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause he made you perfect, babe""
""So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say""

[Chorus]
I was born this way
I was born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital ""H""im
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Way)

I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

I couldn't love a man so purely

My mama told me when I was young
""We are all born superstars""
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause He made you perfect, babe""
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa

[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm dressed cool, my parents put up a fight
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And if I'm a hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And in the morning, I'm short of my identity
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I scream, ""Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I wanna be?""
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
To be

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know
I am my hair

[Chorus]
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
A chance (No)

I can be the queen

A voice speaks through the noise like drums

Listen to me when I say""

Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready, climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
'Cause that's where we make love
Come on and run
Turn the car on and run

I'm gonna marry the night (The night)
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night (The night)
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital ""H-I-M"" (M, M, M, M)
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
""We are all born superstars""
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause He made you perfect, babe""
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby

We don't care what people say, we know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom

[Verse 1]
I'm a bitch
I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
'Til they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby

Pump your fist if you would rather mess up than put up with this

And I don't give a damn, I love it when you're mad

Give me your money or I'll hold my breath

There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby

But I got a reason that you're who should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight

It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous

Where we can both fall far in love

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause he made you perfect, babe""
""So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say""

[Chorus]
I was born this way
I was born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital ""H""im
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Way)

Mum mum mum mah

[Verse 1]
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it; baby, stay with me (I love it)
Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun (fun)

Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing

Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)

And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
[Verse 4: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing

Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'
I'll be dancin', I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say? (Say)
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breakin' up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop callin' me, I'm kinda busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
