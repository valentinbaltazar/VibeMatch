I still hit them dive bars, every once in a blue moon
I've got a wild card, that I keep inside my boot
I've been thinkin' lately maybe I should save it
'Cause them hangovers sure kick my ass these days
So I spend most my happy hours here at home
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old

[Chorus]
But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do
I've been findin' peace of mind slowin' my roll
You learn to toe that line with time as it goes
In the middlе of growin' up and gettin' old

[Verse 2]
It's when you start thinkin', how much time lеft you got
If it's more sand, in the bottom or the top
'Cause that hourglass we have don't last forever
I've been thinkin' 'bout it more and more these days
It's like the less you have, the faster that it goes
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old

[Chorus]
But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go

Her daddy bought it in '95
He built a cabin at the end of the drive
And he named that gravel path after his pride and joy
I met Hannah when we was in school
She was hot as Alabama in June
Wasn't long before I was knockin' on her door

[Chorus]
And we were goin' down Hannah Ford Road
Yeah, it always took us where we wanted to go
We couldn't wait any longer
And the feelin' couldn't get any stronger
Man, her daddy woulda killed me if he'd only known what was goin' on
Down Hannah Ford Road

[Verse 2]
Now Mr. Ford, he wasn't no fool
He kinda figured what we were up to
He said, ""Hannah, I don't want you seein' that boy no more""
So I'd cut the lights a quarter mile out
She'd meet me 'tween there and the house
Like two thieves in the night in the light of the dashboard glow

A signal of the times, a turning of the page
There used to be nothing here but that nothing disappeared
The pond, the barn, the farm, the fields have long since been replaced
Asphalt parking where that ten pew, Pentecostal stood
Fast food, four lanes and a subdivided neighborhood

The walls of the world are closin' in
The spreadin' city spreads us thin
We can't seem to make our ends meet the black
Nеver would've thought it wouldn't last
A way of life that timе moved past
What I wouldn't give to have the back forty back

Maybe I'm a sucker for knowing who lives next door
A view from my back porch, a pinch of peace and quiet
I can't get back the used to bes, so I hang on to the memories
Of when I could still look up and see the stars not street lights shining

There's a beat comin' from somewhere other than my chest
There's words that stir up dust in the peace that I will rest
A melody to ease the mind long after I've lost mine
I will, but my song will never die

[Verse 2]
I don't know the day, I don't know the time
But one day, my Bonnie ain't gonna have her Clyde
And I know I'll be leaving somewhere further down the line
I will, but my song will never die

[Chorus]
When I hear that Hallelujah chorus callin' me back home
I'll lay down this guitar and someone else can sing my songs
It ain't about the leavin', it's in what you leave behind
I will, but my song will never die

[Verse 3]
True words are rare birds, they heal up broken hearts
They sing through rusty strings on beat up old guitars
The notes are always changin' but truth stands the test of time
I will, but my song will never die

[Chorus]
When I hear that Hallelujah chorus callin' me back home
I'll lay down this guitar and someone else can sing my songs
It ain't about the leavin', it's in what you leave behind

My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kick-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West, out where the wild things are

[Verse 2]
He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
And how he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, oh-oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are

[Verse 3]
I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are

But I knew he'd never leave

Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, oh-oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed

I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his

Watchin' the world through the windowpane
From the second row of the ten-man van

It ain't quite the life you dreamed about
When momma calls and you miss out
'Cause you're on stage at a damned ol' one-off show

The songs that bought the house and cars
And how your hometown's proud of where you are
And your name up on the marquee sign
But not the dark that comes to find you
Every single time them lights go down
Yeah, that's the part, they don't tell you about

And hope that Band-Aid on her heart
Sticks just long enough for you to make it home
She feels like she comes in second place
To plaques on walls and long highways
She needs something more than words to hold on to

But not the one you're gonna miss
While they scream your name again in some small town
Yeah, that's the part, they don't tell you about

[Bridge]
When you're doing it all right
And, man, it still feels wrong
Breakin' her damn heart
Chasin' these damn songs

[Chorus]
Thinkin', man, it ain't that hard
Strum some chords on that old guitar
Do some shots in a smokey bar
And everybody knows your name
'Til they're changing out the marquee sign
Then that darkness comes to find you
And everyone's gone home and the lights go down
Yeah, that's the part, they don't tell you about

[Outro]
They don't tell you aboutEmbed"

Someone asked me once in an interview
""What was growing up like?""
""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool

[Chorus]
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

[Verse 2]
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do

Twelve-inch kickers get to shakin'
Them girls get to paintin' on denim and makeup
Pourin' Tito's in a Route 44 cup
In between city limit signs

Like a rural route movie scene
In the nowhere dust, fallin' in love underneath an endless sky
Pick a map dot town, that's how it goes down

I almost finished college, but I ain't cut from that cloth
Used to wish I was, but I'm glad I'm not

I pick a little guitar in the evenin'
Wear Mossy Oak outta deer season
I couldn’t be anybody but me, even if I tried

Used to have a Tennessee Bill Dance hat
But barely ever got 'em in the boat
I used to wanna hit 'em like Chipper did
But I swung it just a little too slow
Yeah, these days I don't wanna be anybody but me

We snuck in the back of that college town frat
'Cause they wouldn't let us in the front
Threw their Miller Time keg in a Chevrolet bed
And we let them horses run
Cut a path through the grass, yelling, ""Kiss my ass!""
With a middle finger in the wind
We laughed, we drank, every now and then I think
Man, I'd love to do that again

[Chorus]
Those were some good times
Those were the best nights
Thе freedom you feel when you're learning to fly
And thе song on the radio was singin' our lives
I can't say that the moon in the sky
Was shinin' any brighter than it is tonight
But it looked on fire back then
It probably wasn't, but it seemed a little better back when

[Verse 2]
Gravel lot spot by the porta J'ohns
'Bout a quarter mile from the door
Worked three weeks for a pair of cheap seats
To hear ""Never Wanted Nothing More""
We were feelin' that buzz from a summertime love
And a bottle tucked in a boot
It's crazy to think that looking back now
But back then, we never knew

A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I’m findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day

Soon as it's gone I find out
Your memory is still around
And here to stay

All about hang-ups and hangovers

I don't know why you can't buy wine 'round here on Sunday
Or an ice-cold beer at a college football game
I don't know why at eighteen, mama gave me a curfew
But it was, ""Son, you're under my roof, then you're under my rules""

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan
But some of them I'll never understand

[Chorus]
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

[Verse 2]
I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me
Are raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down
Or why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds

[Chorus]
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two

But at least I'm out of this house

I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech

A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

[Chorus]
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer

When the dogwoods start to bloom
And the crickets hum their tune
That's usually about the time
That I feel most alive
But the news has all been bad
And the whole world seems so sad
I ain't had much else going on
So I sat down and wrote this song

[Chorus]
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
It's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

[Verse 2]
First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands

Didn’t dawn on me back then but now I see

You make sacrifices every night and day
Never hear the crowd scream your name
But there’s a smile and a hand to hold when the show is through

I don't know why you can't buy wine 'round here on Sundays
Or an ice cold beer at a college football game
I don't know why at eighteen, mama gave me a curfew
But it was, ""Son, you're under my roof, then you're under my rules""

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan
And some of them, I'll never understand

[Chorus]
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You sent me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom, off the deep end
I got my reasons

[Verse 2]
I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me
Are raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down
Or why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds

[Chorus]
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You sent me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two

Inside the walls of prison, my body may be
But the Lord has set my soul free

[Verse 1]
There's a greystone chapel here at Folsom
A house of worship in this den of sin
You wouldn’t think that God had a place here at Folsom
But he saved the souls of many lost men
Now, there's a greystone chapel here at Folsom
Stands a hundred years tall, made of granite rock
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom
But the door to the house of God is never locked

[Chorus]
Inside the walls of prison, my body may be
But the Lord has set my soul free
But my Lord has set my soul free

[Verse 2]
There are men here that don't ever worship
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray
But I’ve got down on my knees in that greystone chapel
And I thanked the Lord for helping me each day
Now, there's a greystone chapel here at Folsom
It has a touch of God's hand on every stone
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness
And it's given me the strength to carry on

I always thought that whiskey was just somethin' that you sipped
I always thought a smoke was somethin’ I'd never do again
I thought I was in control
And I was on a roll

[Verse 2]
I never thought a picture was enough to break me down
I never knew a king size bed was just another place to drown
Or how lonely lonely sounds
But man, I get it now

[Chorus]
I'm learnin’ somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I'm findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day

[Verse 3]
I thought I knew it all, but girl, I guess you're showin’ me
I’m findin' out how freedom can feel anything but free
And how hurtin’ hurts like hell
Yeah, as far as I can tell

I don't know why you can't buy wine 'round here on Sunday
Or an ice-cold beer at a college football game
I don't know why at eighteen, mama gave me a curfew
But it was, ""Son, you're under my roof, then you're under my rules""

I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan
But some of them I'll never understand

[Chorus]
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

[Verse 2]
I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me
Are raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down
Or why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds

And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today

I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road

And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back

2 PM, Gate B10, it can't come soon enough
I've got a mid-flight magazine and a mixed drink
I wish time would fly right with me
Damn the days that baggage claim's in another taxi town
But they always bring me back to you

[Chorus]
I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you

[Verse 2]
I've spent every mile missing you, baby
It's enough to drive me crazy
""I love you""'s from hotel rooms
They sure do make it tough
But they always bring me back to you

[Chorus]

From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

But here comes a few days of unpaid vacation
And there ain’t no way José I'll waste them
'Cause there ain’t no better feeling than when

I pick up a beer can and get to feeling like superman
Its Friday night y'all, here's the plan
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand
Any flavor, size, or brand
Until the point where I can’t stand
No nothing picks me up like a beer can

[Verse 2]
I woke up at I pm
And introduced myself to my new girlfriend
And there’s a wrecking ball sized hole in the wall in the basement
I ain't got no clue how or who could have made it
Well all I know is shit hit the fan
And here we go again

Until I bumped into some of your friends over there talkin' to mine

Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’

You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice

Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

From calling to you

But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess

I lied when I said

That I can't hang

Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart

For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my

Midnight Prevost heading down to Alabam' (Alabam')
I got a three-night run, we’re gonna kick it off in Birmingham
Headlights, wide lines, flying down 65
Trying to catch a few hours’ sleep
Tomorrow comes showtime, that’s when I know I’m
Livin' that neon dream

[Chorus]
Oh, I got the bus and the band and a one-night stand
Waiting on us down the road we’re gonna
Load it in, crank it to ten, whiskey shots till 2am
And off to another show and then it’s
Back to my baby for a couple days
But I can only stay for so long
'Til that honky-tonk highway’s calling me home

[Verse 2]
Rolling into Mobile, name on the marquee sign
Waving at the women that are standing in the ticket line
Point me to the stage I know that’s the only place I’m ever
Smoky bars, guitars, breaking all the girls’ hearts
That’s the only life for me

[Chorus]
Oh, I got the bus and the band and a one-night stand
Waiting on us down the road we’re gonna
Load it in, crank it to ten, whiskey shots till 2am
And off to another show and then it’s
Back to my baby for a couple days

With a killer view
Of the empty Astrodome
Got a tab at the bar downstairs

And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with ""Missin' you""

The coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you

You should've seen a midnight rodeo
The way them saloon doors swing
When they line dance to ""Copperhead Road""

Cheap boat, six pack of some' light
A fireball burning up a blue sky
Mercury '93, wasn't even half past noon
Our first taste of freedom after high school
Breaking hearts and curfews and mama’s rules
I just laugh thinking ’bout all the shit we got into
Yeah those were the days we thought we'd never lose

[Chorus]
But we did
And we miss
How it was when we were just kids
Looking back
On the past
Wasn’t much but it's what we had
Just a couple buds and a good buzz, that's all it was
But that's what memories are made of

[Verse 2]
Its been so long since me and Katie first met
We lost touch as all of the years went flying past, fading fast
Wishing I could make her mine
There's some things that seem to take you right back
I see her face every time I hear that
Lynyrd Skynyrd, bottle spin
I'm in her arms, in my mind
Yeah those were the days we thought we'd never lose (never lose)

Seems a little stiff for 2 PM
Holler if you need anything
I've got an ear to lend
I'll be right here cuttin' limes
Countin' cash and stockin' beers
I've got an idea what's on your mind
So in the meantime, think on this

I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one

This ain't my first rodeo
I've seen the other side of this bar
Pourin' salts on an open wound
Sittin' right there where you are
And I know it probably stings right now

But that clock on the wall will cure it all

Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightnin'
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again

And walked out

To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf

Couldn't wait to ride out of that one horse town
Didn't see no use in sticking around
I was green and busting at the seams to leave
I was sitting on G, waiting on O
The day I hit eighteen, I hit the road
Traded that county maintain for a four lane city street

[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be
What you want ain't always what you need

[Chorus]
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
So be careful what you wish for

[Verse 2]
She was holding on just a little too tight
Talked a little too much about the rest of our lives
I broke her heart thinking freedom would set me free

Trying to catch a few hours’ sleep
Tomorrow comes showtime, that’s when I know I’m
Livin' that neon dream

Oh, I got the bus and the band and a one-night stand
Waiting on us down the road we’re gonna
Load it in, crank it to ten, whiskey shots till 2am
And off to another show and then it’s
Back to my baby for a couple days
But I can only stay for so long
'Til that honky-tonk highway’s calling me home

Rolling into Mobile, name on the marquee sign
Waving at the women that are standing in the ticket line
Point me to the stage I know that’s the only place I’m ever
Smoky bars, guitars, breaking all the girls’ hearts
That’s the only life for me

Waits for you to come home

Had the Crown mixed up in a Dixie cup, when she hopped into the cab
She said ""Boy what you got in store, what we getting into tonight?""
Hell, I don't care, It ain't here nor there, just as long as you're by my side

Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done
Or with the seats leaned back and the radio on
On the backstreets, in the backseat
Those baby blue eyes staring back at me
Whether it's in park or it's in drive
I love the way she rides

So we hit that ground a running, throwing caution to the wind
And it wasn't long before that drink was gone, and she was shakin' that ass again
She said find somewhere dark where we can park, and put a hurtin' on this bottle
So we said goodnight to the city lights, kicking it in full throttle

I ain't givin' you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
Just a little bit will have you feelin' just right
So dude, we can share if you want to

[Bridge]
Well we got off both times, even though we crossed that line
And you can too, 'cause all you have to do is say

[Chorus]
We can share if you want to
So buddy won't you?
Take a hit and help us finish shit tonight
I ain't givin' you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
Just a little bit will have you feelin' just right
So dude, we can share if you want to

[Outro]
We can share if you want toEmbed"

Lyrics[Verse 1]
Back in the day it was a six gun and a six-string
Man, that was country
And that's the way country still oughta be
It was lived, not taught, it was earned, not bought
Had to put in the work to get to the top
Let me tell you what I thinks really gone wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
These days it's all wannabes singin' someone else's songs
Everybody's doing the same damn thing
Where have the rebels gone?

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' 'baccer and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Verse 2]
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and Wrangler jeans
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no
It's the words and what they mean
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk
And brother, that's the truth
So honestly, what would Waylon do?

I can guarantee that if he was alive today
He'd ask us one more time
""Hoss, you sure Hank done it this way?""

[Chorus]
We don't need another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' 'baccer and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Bridge]
Are the good times really gone for good
Or can we get back to our roots?
It's about damn time we raise the bar
So raise a glass if you feel like I do

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' tobacco, and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
And I pray country answers my call
Can I get an outlaw?
Oh, can I get an outlaw?1Embed"
