(Been trill, been doin' it, been at it)
Your flow is such a bore
Drinkin' a bottle of Henny through a straw
Bitch, you better stop that dialogue (28 shit)
'Fore I hit Carl and buy your catalog
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Sigh
How you fuck your mother man when she die?
How you go on Gayle King and can't cry?
Chile, bye
Big Foot, but you still a small fry
Swearin' on your dead mother when you lie (Ayo)

[Verse]
This lil' beggin' whore talkin' 'bout Megan's Law
For a free beat, you could hit Megan raw (Ooh)
If you a ghostwriter, party in Megan jaw (Ooh)
Shots thrown, but I still ain't let Megan score (Tell 'em)
Bad bitch, she like six foot (Ooh), I call her Big Foot (Brr)
The bitch fell off, I said, ""Get up on your good foot""
Uh, still ain't topped ""Red Ruby"" (No, no, mhm)
Tryna steal the sauce, I said, ""Get up out my cookbook"" (Brr)
But really, I'm a sweetie pie
P-R-T-T-Y, but I'm P-E-T-T-Y (Brr)
Um, why did you lie about your lipo?
Fuckin' your best friend man is crazy, you the type, though
You was lyin' to the queen, then you went lyin' to the King, Gayle
The thirty-year-old tea so stale
Kylie kicked you out and made you stumble to the car
Barbz, I need a good alcohol bar
Roman, wait, that was the bar
Like a body builder, I keep raisin' the bar
Fuck you get shot with no scar? (Brr)
This little piggy toxic, somebody adopt it
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Shit'll get dark like chocolate
I'm 'bout to get up in your ass, bitch, clench (Woo)
Mm, yeah, sorta like French
They got you all them Grammys, but your flow's still a no
What a fiasco, Lupe
Future made you pay (Haha)
She wanna party with DaBaby while rubbin' on Tory toupée
I guess she needed money bags for them Trey Songz
She G-Eazy, Carl made her crawl for it
Yo, why the fuck they poke the monster?
Fuckin' with Nicki this year, ho, I'm comin' like a pornstar
She just mad that no nigga ever loved her
No nigga gon' stand ten toes behind her
Is it my fault I got good vagin-er?
Why the fuck is you humpin' on a minor?
'Cause she was lyin' on your dead mama (Ooh), on-on your dead mama (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Lyin' on your dead mama, on-on your dead mama
Lyin' on your dead mama, lyin' on your dead mama
Lyin' on your, lyin', lyin', lyin' on your dead mama (Brr, ooh)

Now listen up, Big Foot
You know I got a lotta tea
I went easy on you
Umm (Glass-fragment-foot-ass bitch)
You know, whenever I meet a woman that would fuck her friend's man
(And let your friend talk about your ex-friend baby on the internet)
I know that (No, no), they have a very evil spirit
Um (Where my prayer warriors at?)
I don't think you want the next installment of this song
I know it's the most attention you've ever gotten
One-flow ho, but, uh, trust
If you don't apologize to your mama in twenty-four hours
Shit gon' get uglier than KenBarbie, okay? Don't play
Um, and also, I'd like to say
To my supporters, I love you, may God bless you, you're amazing
Um, all the good-pussy gyal dem too, yes

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj & Billie Eilish]
You never got to meet Papa (I could lie, say I like it like that)
He sweet proper, he keep Mama on my toes (Like it like that)
I needed help, you booked a flight (I could lie, and say I like it like that)
In three days, you'd meet Papa (Like it like that, mm)
The waiting, the gazing
The painting, the raging
The ravin', the pacing
The praying, the shaking
I must admit, I was breaking
I must admit, I was taking
I must admit, my heart was racing
Telephone ring, he didn't make it
I just believed you'd awaken
A memory in the makin'
Call me
Won't you call me? (Call)

Barbie dangerous
Weak bitches don't endanger us
You are over, you ain't in range of us
'Cause I won, won, won, won, angel numbers
Splash in some Burberry rain boots
Lookin' like every designer fave muse
Front row, next to the who's who
Tryna build another Barbie doll, screw's loose
Name a rapper that could channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear
Ho, I'm mother of the year
Every summer, I come out to walk bitches, make 'em disappear
But to me, it's just another year
She ain't got that kind of flair, let me see what I'ma wear
They gon' copy, I'ma wear Moncler
Heavy on the arch (Facts), he was hittin' from the back
Then he asked was all this my hair, um, yeah

[Chorus]
Spit your game, pop your shit
Face on pretty, ass stay thick
Beef with who? She got the right one
All these rap bitches, ain't got to like none

And I'm still queenin'
Chanel bags, they still swingin'
Old hits, they still swingin'
They love the flow, they still streamin'
But it's kill season
You apologized, but it's still treason
Got 'em steamin' like dry cleanin'
Move on my time and I ain't no demon
Hoes' words ain't got no meanin'
Queen of this rap shitty, Bohemian
They worst nightmare, they still dreamin'
Bitches jackin', I'm still queenin'
And I'm still prayin'
You would too if you knew
How these jealous bitches move
First .22 by twenty-two
They don't know the half 'til they cracked in two
So-called beef with who, wait, who?
Broke a couple rap niggas hearts in two
Now them ah chat pon interviews
It's clear to see they wanna be me
Hit the road, E-X-I-T

Shots thrown, but I-D-C
Go home or do it B-I-G

Ayo

[Verse]
I drop a bag on the Rolls with the temp tags
My niggas locked, scammin' money out their pen pals
I know a bitch, bust it open in the club
Introduce you to the plug, ten plates for like ten cash
I got a call, told him, ""Meet me in the backstreets""
Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat
I'm not impressed, I said, ""Yo, the D mad weak""
Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat
I told him that he had the chance of a lifetime
Who wanna be a millionaire? I'm your lifeline
These bitches always checkin' for mе like a Nike sign
Niggas always frontin' when thеy only did some light time

[Chorus]
Beep, beep, beep, is that bleep?
Is that you talkin' to me? It's that deep?
If I don't even know you exist, is that beef?
When niggas get their jaw broke, wait, is that teeth?

(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
Ayo

[Verse 1]
Told him shoot his shot like his main opp
Now I'm fallin' for him like a raindrop
Done that, run that
Yo, Patty, give me the gun back
When he say cock it back, gun off safety
Thinkin' 'bout you lately, JoJo and K-Ci
I be on that calm flex, them gyal hasty
Gyal, them want me face, but them gyal, they can't face me
I-I ain't really tryna let him in, in (In, in)
But if he a G, it's a win, win (Win, win)
Can't play the queen before the king, king (King, king)
Bitch, I'm the Pinkprint, tell him to kiss the pink ring

[Chorus]
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm, I think I'm, I think I'm fallin' for you)

[Verse 2]
They like 'em, they fightin', they comin', they tuggin'
I kill 'em, I beat 'em, I see them, they duckin'
Got pitbulls, we feed 'еm, it's nothin'
They never been official, thеy never been a issue
Plus they know that my body tea, my middle initial
I let him kiss the real, he know my looks could kill
These bitches gotta shake they ass to show sex appeal

Picture that, picture me givin' bitches slack
Picture pretendin' I ain't give all these bitches piggyback
Picture usin' me and the Barbz and never givin' back
Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black
Ain't at the mall, but between me and them, it's a gap
Pictures sayin' that you the queen and knowin' it's a fact
Picture my hair givin' wet and wavy, strawberry daq'
Yo, matter fact, let me take that back before they steal that
Picture me openin' the vault, bitch, I seal that
Picture them disses stickin' like grits, bitches feel that
Picture me tellin' bitches ""catch it,"" outer field that
Picture me not tellin' my lil' niggas drill that
Picture you endin' up under the sea where the dread at
Picture not listenin' when I said you would dread that
I mean locs, ho, you's-you's a chop ho
I'm number one, y'all go argue over top four
Clean sweep, you gettin' mopped, ho
Picture me dressed in black, they callin' me Miss Mary Mack (Mary Mack)
You get the picture (Get the picture), my niggas airin' that
Like-like married to the mob, bitch, I'm married to the Makk
Picture it not gettin' scary, it's airier than Max

Hold, hold you
Let me hold you
Wanna hold, hold you
Let me hold you
Hold, hold you (Let me, let me, let me)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Pull off and I almost hit him
He actin' like I ain't always with him
My heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him
And ain't no more debatin', this time, it's a ultimatum
I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him
Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him
I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him
Twenty years later, them decisions, I don't regret them
Just wish you would give me space when I really need it
To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated
Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated
Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed
Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it
Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk
Just did a detox, now I wanna spar

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a sign for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so

Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart
She bad as fuck but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault
She got ambition like the niggas, and the vision for herself
So she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark
So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part
Sometimes you gotta play the back
But when you do, make sure you play it smart
All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard
They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a rated-R
You like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R
Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard
Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart
Yet you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across
But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God
To keep the family together at a time when it's so regular to break apart
So God forbid, y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought
It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath in your lungs
I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from
I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones
That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come
Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun
As if they life is somehow perfect and they never been plunged
Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done
It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]

You bitches look up to me
You said you look up to her, but really you look up to me
I can't be playin' with niggas, I married a G
I got some niggas that do what I say, if I tell 'em to shoot, they pull up from the three
When bitches be rappin', I'm laughin', it sound like you tryin' to me
I'm who you dyin' to be
Will somebody cop all these groupies a ticket? 'Cause I'm who they dyin' to meet
I'm in the city, I drop a location and all of the killers come out

Only on them C's if it's breeze, Red Ruby Da Sleeze  (Uh-oh, uh-oh)

Anyway, 你好 (你好, uh-oh)
Who the fuck told bitches they was me now? (Uh-oh, ooh)
I knew these bitches was slow, I ain't know these bitches senile (Ooh)
Married a shooter case you niggas tried to breathe loud (Brr-brr)
Boom your face off, then I tell him, ""Cease fire""
I'm the A, B side
Seven-hundred on them horses when we fixin' to leave (Uh-oh)
But I don't fuck with horses since Christopher Reeves (Uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Gotta be careful when I dip, it's flips all in the whip
It's 40s with 30 clips, FN's with the switch
Guacamole with the taco, waitin' on El Chapo
Came in the Rolls and left low in a Tahoe

Phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, ""What you gonna do with your life?""
Oh, Daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I could tell he the one 'cause they hated on him
Used to be a high roller, but I skated on him
When he went away, then I just waited on him
Came back, then I got X-rated on him
Never (Ah-ah), never hesitated on him
Even though I had to go up, elevated on him
Had the trap house, but it got raided on him
But I kept it real, player, never traded on him, uh
I mean, I wouldn't call 'em mini-me's
More like some goofy, doofy, raggedy-ass enemies
I mean, one thing for sure, ain't no forgettin' me
Me and my girls been them hoes, start weedin' them, uh
When the sun hit his eyes, like when a star-star tw-twinkle at night
Guys, I just can't say bye
Suddenly speak Thai, man, he samurai fly

She's alright

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I can lick it, I can ride it while you slippin' and slidin'
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it, you can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me ’lone, he always tell me he miss it

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write ""pressure"" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)
P-P-P-Pressure applied, can’t fuck a regular guy
Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than apple pie

Fronto with the raw, how the gumbo roll
My nigga with the pot, it ain't gumbo though (Bahm, bahm)

Switchin' up the plans if that dumb ho go
We out in SoHo, you just so-so, ho (Bahm, bahm)
Man, y'all know that bitch is wack, y'all gon' tell her or not?
Y'all report everything, y'all be tellin' a lot (Bahm, bahm)
Gotta tell my niggas chill 'fore they snap like 'Chat
Pussy and the crown, everything intact (Mm)

They say my price ridiculous, I don't like them bitches
Pussy tight and vicious, hit them likes to lick this (Oop; bahm, bahm)

I'm always up, ain't gotta ante
I ball hard, don't ever owe them like Lamy
Ayo, these bitches lucky that I still ain't find a nanny
All of them is my juniors, Sammy, uh
They know I pop up like jump rope
If-If the queen Sleeze put a bag on it, then it's gun smoke
So we ain't playin' on the internet
I got bigger fish to fry, that's why I got a bigger net

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj, Blondie]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me, but I shitted on him first
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, woah
Who real or fake? Sorry, baby, I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
They don't know me, but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life
They gon' talk about me whether I'm wrong or I'm right

How was I thinkin' 'bout you when I'm shakin' hands with your superior?

(Bone Collector the plug)
(ThisIsHabib)
So sweet
Mm

[Verse 1]
I go at nine, yeah, I got a show tonight
But I ain't been feelin' right, all I see is blurry lines
Baby, would you tell 'em for me? I can hear them yellin' for me
Tell them I'm in Hell, ain't funny (Yeah, I'm in Hell, ain't funny)
Baby, now you gotta do it, keep drinkin' a lot of fluid
I'll be here to guide you through it (I'll be here to guide you through it)
And maybe I ain't got it in me, maybe it's just time to end it
I'm sorry, may God forgive me? (Did God forgive me? Tick-tock)

[Pre-Chorus]
So, so, so sad
So, so (Ooh), so sad
A bunch of memories (Memories)
A bunch of memories, baby (Baby)
A bunch of memories (Memories)
It's just the memories

[Chorus]
Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
There's never been another you
You

I 'member when I was the girl that everybody doubted
When every label turned me down, and then they laughed about it
I 'member goin' home and writin' fifty more raps
Just 'cause I knew you really wanted me to fall back
I 'member one of my first crushes in the fifth grade
He got killed, stabbed in the neck with a switchblade (Ooh)
I 'member when this girl in the hood thought she caught me slippin'
I got arrested, I assaulted with a deadly weapon
They say they hate Nicki, mad 'cause they ain't Nicki
All of the colors in the world, you couldn't paint Nicki (Ooh)
I never tried for that, these bitches die for that
I swear it, that's on my life, I'd never lie for that

[Chorus]
Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
They do
They do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
There's never been another you
You (Memories)

[Verse 3]
I told Drake that he don't owe me nothin', never did
I pray that Wayne always remembered that I never slid
Look at all the shit that y'all threw at me, and I never dipped
Greatest female rapper to ever live, and that's on my kid (Memories)
I could've overdosed, could've been comatosed
Wait, hold on, Juice, I feel the baby kickin', holy smokes
I prayed for a son, my husband wanted one
If they ask about me, tell 'em I was one of one
[Chorus]
Memories don't leave like people do (They don't leave like people do)
They'll always 'member you (They'll always remember you)
There's never been another you (There's never been another you)
Tell 'em I was one of one (You)

[Post-Chorus]
(So, so) Memories
(So, sad) Don't leave like people do
(So, fast) No, no, no
(So, sad) No, no, no, no, no
(So, so) Yeah, yeah, yeah

I drop a bag on the Rolls with the temp tags
My niggas locked, scammin' money out their pen pals
I know a bitch bust it open in the club
Introduce you to the plug, ten plates feel like ten cash
I got a call, told him, ""Meet me in the backstreets""
Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat
I'm not impressed, I said, ""Yo, the D mad weak""
Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat
I told him that he had the chance of a lifetime
Who wanna be a millionaire? I'm your lifeline
These bitches always checkin' for me like a Nike sign
Niggas always frontin' when they only did some light time

Beep, beep, beep, is that bleep? (Bleep)

I used to think my happiness depended on a man (A man)
Diamond on the ring finger blingin' on my hand (My hand)
Sativa or Indica, it don't matter what the strain
The worst drug of all, the addiction to a man (A man, ooh)
Insecurе, real jealous, bitter littlе man (A man)
Cursin', beat a woman, but he never hit a man (A man)
Man, yeah, you such a man, damn (A man)

Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj & Billie Eilish]
You never got to meet Papa (I could lie, say I like it like that)
He sweet proper, he keep Mama on my toes (Like it like that)
I needed help, you booked a flight (I could lie, and say I like it like that)
In three days, you'd meet Papa (Like it like that, mm)
The waiting, the gazing
The painting, the raging
The ravin', the pacing
The praying, the shaking
I must admit, I was breaking
I must admit, I was taking
I must admit, my heart was racing
Telephone ring, he didn't make it
I just believed you'd awaken
A memory in the makin'
Call me
Won't you call me? (Call)

Why didn't you come back to get me?
Let me, let me, let me be
Why would anyone want to love me?

You've already made your peace with me
One day, you'll have to forgive Mommy
But she knows you know too much already (Don't you know too much already?)

Ayo

[Verse 1]
Barbie dangerous
Weak bitches don't endanger us
You are over, you ain't in range of us
'Cause I won, won, won, won, angel numbers
Splash in some Burberry rain boots
Lookin' like every designer fave muse
Front row, next to the who's who
Tryna build another Barbie doll, screw's loose
Name a rapper that could channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear
Ho, I'm mother of the year
Every summer, I come out to walk bitches, make 'em disappear
But to me, it's just another year
She ain't got that kind of flair, let me see what I'ma wear
They gon' copy, I'ma wear Moncler
Heavy on the arch (Facts), he was hittin' from the back
Then he asked was all this my hair, um, yeah

[Chorus]
Spit your game, pop your shit
Face on pretty, ass stay thick
Beef with who? She got the right one
All these rap bitches, ain't got to like none
Kitty on fleek, I got the tight one
Pink one taken, I got the white one
These rap bitches you like is my sons
Still gon' run this rap shit when I'm done

I'm still sittin' here, you got a lot to prove
Appreciatin' my solitude
Beef ain't my go-to
But I got bags of this bread if we buyin' food
And I'm still queenin'
Chanel bags, they still swingin'
Old hits, they still swingin'
They love the flow, they still streamin'
But it's kill season
You apologized, but it's still treason
Got 'em steamin' like dry cleanin'
Move on my time and I ain't no demon
Hoes' words ain't got no meanin'
Queen of this rap shitty, Bohemian
They worst nightmare, they still dreamin'
Bitches jackin', I'm still queenin'
And I'm still prayin'
You would too if you knew
How these jealous bitches move
First .22 by twenty-two
They don't know the half 'til they cracked in two
So-called beef with who, wait, who?
Broke a couple rap niggas hearts in two
Now them ah chat pon interviews
It's clear to see they wanna be me
Hit the road, E-X-I-T
My flow, they B-I-T
Shots thrown, but I-D-C
Go home or do it B-I-G
My throne, they can't S-I-T
My crown, you can't F-I-T
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me

[Verse]
I drop a bag on the Rolls with the temp tags
My niggas locked, scammin' money out their pen pals
I know a bitch, bust it open in the club
Introduce you to the plug, ten plates for like ten cash
I got a call, told him, ""Meet me in the backstreets""
Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat
I'm not impressed, I said, ""Yo, the D mad weak""
Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat
I told him that he had the chance of a lifetime
Who wanna be a millionaire? I'm your lifeline
These bitches always checkin' for mе like a Nike sign
Niggas always frontin' when thеy only did some light time

[Chorus]
Beep, beep, beep, is that bleep?
Is that you talkin' to me? It's that deep?
If I don't even know you exist, is that beef?
When niggas get their jaw broke, wait, is that teeth?

Picture that, picture me givin' bitches slack
Picture pretendin' I ain't give all these bitches piggyback
Picture usin' me and the Barbz and never givin' back
Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black
Ain't at the mall, but between me and them, it's a gap
Pictures sayin' that you the queen and knowin' it's a fact
Picture my hair givin' wet and wavy, strawberry daq'
Yo, matter fact, let me take that back before they steal that
Picture me openin' the vault, bitch, I seal that
Picture them disses stickin' like grits, bitches feel that
Picture me tellin' bitches ""catch it,"" outer field that
Picture me not tellin' my lil' niggas drill that
Picture you endin' up under the sea where the dread at
Picture not listenin' when I said you would dread that
I mean locs, ho, you's-you's a chop ho
I'm number one, y'all go argue over top four
Clean sweep, you gettin' mopped, ho
Picture me dressed in black, they callin' me Miss Mary Mack (Mary Mack)
You get the picture (Get the picture), my niggas airin' that

Hold, hold you
Let me hold you
Wanna hold, hold you
Let me hold you
Hold, hold you (Let me, let me, let me)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Pull off and I almost hit him
He actin' like I ain't always with him
My heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him
And ain't no more debatin', this time, it's a ultimatum
I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him
Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him
I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him
Twenty years later, them decisions, I don't regret them
Just wish you would give me space when I really need it
To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated
Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated
Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed
Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it
Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk
Just did a detox, now I wanna spar

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a sign for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so
Do you know?

Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart
She bad as fuck but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault
She got ambition like the niggas, and the vision for herself
So she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark
So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part
Sometimes you gotta play the back
But when you do, make sure you play it smart
All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard
They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a rated-R
You like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R
Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard
Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart
Yet you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across
But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God
To keep the family together at a time when it's so regular to break apart
So God forbid, y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought
It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath in your lungs
I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from
I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones
That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come
Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun
As if they life is somehow perfect and they never been plunged
Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done
It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]

You bitches look up to me
You said you look up to her, but really you look up to me
I can't be playin' with niggas, I married a G
I got some niggas that do what I say, if I tell 'em to shoot, they pull up from the three
When bitches be rappin', I'm laughin', it sound like you tryin' to me
I'm who you dyin' to be
Will somebody cop all these groupies a ticket? 'Cause I'm who they dyin' to meet
I'm in the city, I drop a location and all of the killers come out
These niggas be frontin' for y'all, but they play the back when them killers is out
When them killers is out, cut 'em off like the scissors is out

Anyway, 你好 (你好, uh-oh)
Who the fuck told bitches they was me now? (Uh-oh, ooh)
I knew these bitches was slow, I ain't know these bitches senile (Ooh)
Married a shooter case you niggas tried to breathe loud (Brr-brr)
Boom your face off, then I tell him, ""Cease fire""
I'm the A, B side
Seven-hundred on them horses when we fixin' to leave (Uh-oh)
But I don't fuck with horses since Christopher Reeves (Uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Gotta be careful when I dip, it's flips all in the whip
It's 40s with 30 clips, FN's with the switch
Guacamole with the taco, waitin' on El Chapo
Came in the Rolls and left low in a Tahoe

My father yells, ""What you gonna do with your life?""
Oh, Daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I could tell he the one 'cause they hated on him
Used to be a high roller, but I skated on him
When he went away, then I just waited on him
Came back, then I got X-rated on him
Never (Ah-ah), never hesitated on him
Even though I had to go up, elevated on him
Had the trap house, but it got raided on him
But I kept it real, player, never traded on him, uh
I mean, I wouldn't call 'em mini-me's
More like some goofy, doofy, raggedy-ass enemies
I mean, one thing for sure, ain't no forgettin' me
Me and my girls been them hoes, start weedin' them, uh
When the sun hit his eyes, like when a star-star tw-twinkle at night
Guys, I just can't say bye
Suddenly speak Thai, man, he samurai fly

They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write ""pressure"" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)
P-P-P-Pressure applied, can’t fuck a regular guy
Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than apple pie

Switchin' up the plans if that dumb ho go
We out in SoHo, you just so-so, ho (Bahm, bahm)
Man, y'all know that bitch is wack, y'all gon' tell her or not?
Y'all report everything, y'all be tellin' a lot (Bahm, bahm)
Gotta tell my niggas chill 'fore they snap like 'Chat
Pussy and the crown, everything intact (Mm)

Pussy tight and vicious, hit them likes to lick this (Oop; bahm, bahm)

I'm always up, ain't gotta ante
I ball hard, don't ever owe them like Lamy
Ayo, these bitches lucky that I still ain't find a nanny
All of them is my juniors, Sammy, uh
They know I pop up like jump rope
If-If the queen Sleeze put a bag on it, then it's gun smoke
So we ain't playin' on the internet
I got bigger fish to fry, that's why I got a bigger net

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj, Blondie]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me, but I shitted on him first
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, woah
Who real or fake? Sorry, baby, I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
They don't know me, but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life

I saw all my missed texts, I wanted to clear 'em
I feel like if he really love you, how you let my love near you?
Girl, open your fears up, I had to tear up
How was I thinkin' 'bout you when I'm shakin' hands with your superior?
I knew you was somethin' serious, wanted to protect you
Never upset you, just wanted to sex you
Never, ever would’ve left you
Tell me, I’ll come back and get you

(Murda on the beat so it's not nice)
Ayo

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I drop a bag on the Rolls with the temp tags
My niggas locked, scammin' money out their pen pals
I know a bitch bust it open in the club
Introduce you to the plug, ten plates feel like ten cash
I got a call, told him, ""Meet me in the backstreets""
Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat
I'm not impressed, I said, ""Yo, the D mad weak""
Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat
I told him that he had the chance of a lifetime
Who wanna be a millionaire? I'm your lifeline
These bitches always checkin' for me like a Nike sign
Niggas always frontin' when they only did some light time

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Beep, beep, beep, is that bleep? (Bleep)
Is that you talkin' to me? It's that deep? (Deep)
If I don't even know you exist, is that beef? (Beef)
When niggas get they jaw broke, wait, is that teeth? (Is that teeth?)

Say, we got some kind of beef, what kind of beef? Please remind me
Niggas all pussy, whole clique punani
A lil' bread with me, you can't hide behind money
Got a lot of this shit, I ain't runnin' out of this shit
Nah, nah, you don't want to stop me, I don't stop
Have my niggas come to spin your block, around the clock
You don't see 'em out there, nigga, fuck it, make it hot

Weak bitches don't endanger us
You are over, you ain't in range of us
'Cause I won, won, won, won, angel numbers
Splash in some Burberry rain boots
Lookin' like every designer fave muse
Front row, next to the who's who
Tryna build another Barbie doll, screw's loose
Name a rapper that could channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear
Ho, I'm mother of the year
Every summer, I come out to walk bitches, make 'em disappear
But to me, it's just another year
She ain't got that kind of flair, let me see what I'ma wear
They gon' copy, I'ma wear Moncler
Heavy on the arch (Facts), he was hittin' from the back
Then he asked was all this my hair, um, yeah

Spit your game, pop your shit
Face on pretty, ass stay thick
Beef with who? She got the right one

They love the flow, they still streamin'
But it's kill season
You apologized, but it's still treason
Got 'em steamin' like dry cleanin'

They worst nightmare, they still dreamin'
Bitches jackin', I'm still queenin'
And I'm still prayin'
You would too if you knew
How these jealous bitches move
First .22 by twenty-two
They don't know the half 'til they cracked in two

Broke a couple rap niggas hearts in two
Now them ah chat pon interviews
It's clear to see they wanna be me
Hit the road, E-X-I-T

Picture that, picture me givin' bitches slack
Picture pretendin' I ain't give all these bitches piggyback
Picture usin' me and the Barbz and never givin' back
Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black
Ain't at the mall, but between me and them, it's a gap
Pictures sayin' that you the queen and knowin' it's a fact
Picture my hair givin' wet and wavy, strawberry daq'
Yo, matter fact, let me take that back before they steal that
Picture me openin' the vault, bitch, I seal that
Picture them disses stickin' like grits, bitches feel that
Picture me tellin' bitches ""catch it,"" outer field that
Picture me not tellin' my lil' niggas drill that
Picture you endin' up under the sea where the dread at
Picture not listenin' when I said you would dread that

Hold, hold you
Let me hold you
Wanna hold, hold you
Let me hold you
Hold, hold you (Let me, let me, let me)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Pull off and I almost hit him
He actin' like I ain't always with him
My heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him
And ain't no more debatin', this time, it's a ultimatum
I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him
Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him
I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him
Twenty years later, them decisions, I don't regret them
Just wish you would give me space when I really need it
To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated
Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated
Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed
Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it
Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk
Just did a detox, now I wanna spar

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a sign for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so
Do you know?

Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart
She bad as fuck but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault
She got ambition like the niggas, and the vision for herself
So she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark
So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part
Sometimes you gotta play the back
But when you do, make sure you play it smart
All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard
They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a rated-R
You like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R
Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard
Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart
Yet you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across
But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God
To keep the family together at a time when it's so regular to break apart
So God forbid, y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought
It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath in your lungs
I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from
I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones
That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come
Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun
As if they life is somehow perfect and they never been plunged
Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done
It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful

You said you look up to her, but really you look up to me
I can't be playin' with niggas, I married a G
I got some niggas that do what I say, if I tell 'em to shoot, they pull up from the three
When bitches be rappin', I'm laughin', it sound like you tryin' to me
I'm who you dyin' to be
Will somebody cop all these groupies a ticket? 'Cause I'm who they dyin' to meet
I'm in the city, I drop a location and all of the killers come out

Only on them C's if it's breeze, Red Ruby Da Sleeze  (Uh-oh, uh-oh)

Anyway, 你好 (你好, uh-oh)
Who the fuck told bitches they was me now? (Uh-oh, ooh)
I knew these bitches was slow, I ain't know these bitches senile (Ooh)
Married a shooter case you niggas tried to breathe loud (Brr-brr)
Boom your face off, then I tell him, ""Cease fire""
I'm the A, B side
Seven-hundred on them horses when we fixin' to leave (Uh-oh)
But I don't fuck with horses since Christopher Reeves (Uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Gotta be careful when I dip, it's flips all in the whip
It's 40s with 30 clips, FN's with the switch
Guacamole with the taco, waitin' on El Chapo
Came in the Rolls and left low in a Tahoe

Phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, ""What you gonna do with your life?""
Oh, Daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I could tell he the one 'cause they hated on him
Used to be a high roller, but I skated on him
When he went away, then I just waited on him
Came back, then I got X-rated on him
Never (Ah-ah), never hesitated on him
Even though I had to go up, elevated on him
Had the trap house, but it got raided on him
But I kept it real, player, never traded on him, uh
I mean, I wouldn't call 'em mini-me's
More like some goofy, doofy, raggedy-ass enemies
I mean, one thing for sure, ain't no forgettin' me
Me and my girls been them hoes, start weedin' them, uh
When the sun hit his eyes, like when a star-star tw-twinkle at night
Guys, I just can't say bye
Suddenly speak Thai, man, he samurai fly

I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it, you can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me ’lone, he always tell me he miss it

One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write ""pressure"" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)
P-P-P-Pressure applied, can’t fuck a regular guy
Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than apple pie

Think they Harajuku, they just some young ho (Bahm, bahm)
Fronto with the raw, how the gumbo roll
My nigga with the pot, it ain't gumbo though (Bahm, bahm)
Switchy on my hippy, sound like drumroll, ho
I paid a couple bands, let the drumrolls go
Switchin' up the plans if that dumb ho go
We out in SoHo, you just so-so, ho (Bahm, bahm)
Man, y'all know that bitch is wack, y'all gon' tell her or not?
Y'all report everything, y'all be tellin' a lot (Bahm, bahm)
Gotta tell my niggas chill 'fore they snap like 'Chat
Pussy and the crown, everything intact (Mm)

They say my price ridiculous, I don't like them bitches
Pussy tight and vicious, hit them likes to lick this (Oop; bahm, bahm)

I'm always up, ain't gotta ante
I ball hard, don't ever owe them like Lamy
Ayo, these bitches lucky that I still ain't find a nanny
All of them is my juniors, Sammy, uh
They know I pop up like jump rope
If-If the queen Sleeze put a bag on it, then it's gun smoke
So we ain't playin' on the internet
I got bigger fish to fry, that's why I got a bigger net

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj, Blondie]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me, but I shitted on him first
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, woah
Who real or fake? Sorry, baby, I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
They don't know me, but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life

I saw all my missed texts, I wanted to clear 'em
I feel like if he really love you, how you let my love near you?
Girl, open your fears up, I had to tear up
How was I thinkin' 'bout you when I'm shakin' hands with your superior?
I knew you was somethin' serious, wanted to protect you
Never upset you, just wanted to sex you
Never, ever would’ve left you
Tell me, I’ll come back and get you

There's never been another you
You (Memories)

[Verse 3]
I told Drake that he don't owe me nothin', never did
I pray that Wayne always remembered that I never slid
Look at all the shit that y'all threw at me, and I never dipped
Greatest female rapper to ever live, and that's on my kid (Memories)
I could've overdosed, could've been comatosed
Wait, hold on, Juice, I feel the baby kickin', holy smokes
I prayed for a son, my husband wanted one
If they ask about me, tell 'em I was one of one
[Chorus]
Memories don't leave like people do (They don't leave like people do)
They'll always 'member you (They'll always remember you)
There's never been another you (There's never been another you)
Tell 'em I was one of one (You)

I used to think love had to hurt
So I'd do shit to make it worse
Got off on the toxic words
I used to think love had to hurt

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & Nicki Minaj]
But, lately
I've been thinkin', maybe
No one needs to save me
'Cause I love me enough for all of y'all
And, lately
They've been tryna change me
But that shit don't faze me
'Cause I love me enough for all of y'all (Uh, ayo)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj & Monica]
I used to think my happiness depended on a man (A man)
Diamond on the ring finger blingin' on my hand (My hand)
Sativa or Indica, it don't matter what the strain
The worst drug of all, the addiction to a man (A man, ooh)
Insecurе, real jealous, bitter littlе man (A man)
Cursin', beat a woman, but he never hit a man (A man)
Man, yeah, you such a man, damn (A man)
Like Tina in a limo, well, bitch had to go ham, scram (Aah)
Fuck I look like? (Brr) I wish I would like (Yeah)
Wasted a couple years, now I'm good like (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Pull off and I almost hit him
He actin' like I ain't always with him
My heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him
And ain't no more debatin', this time, it's a ultimatum
I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him
Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him
I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him
Twenty years later, them decisions, I don't regret them
Just wish you would give me space when I really need it
To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated
Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated
Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed
Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it
Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk
Just did a detox, now I wanna spar

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a sign for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so

Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart
She bad as fuck but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault
She got ambition like the niggas, and the vision for herself
So she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark
So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part
Sometimes you gotta play the back
But when you do, make sure you play it smart
All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard
They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a rated-R
You like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R
Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard
Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart
Yet you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across
But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God
To keep the family together at a time when it's so regular to break apart
So God forbid, y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought
It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath in your lungs
I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from
I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones
That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come
Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun
As if they life is somehow perfect and they never been plunged
Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done
It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real

'Cause I won, won, won, won, angel numbers
Splash in some Burberry rain boots
Lookin' like every designer fave muse
Front row, next to the who's who
Tryna build another Barbie doll, screw's loose
Name a rapper that could channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear
Ho, I'm mother of the year
Every summer, I come out to walk bitches, make 'em disappear
But to me, it's just another year
She ain't got that kind of flair, let me see what I'ma wear
They gon' copy, I'ma wear Moncler
Heavy on the arch (Facts), he was hittin' from the back
Then he asked was all this my hair, um, yeah

Introduce you to the plug, ten plates for like ten cash

Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat

Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat

(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
Ayo

[Verse 1]
Told him shoot his shot like his main opp
Now I'm fallin' for him like a raindrop
Done that, run that
Yo, Patty, give me the gun back
When he say cock it back, gun off safety
Thinkin' 'bout you lately, JoJo and K-Ci
I be on that calm flex, them gyal hasty
Gyal, them want me face, but them gyal, they can't face me
I-I ain't really tryna let him in, in (In, in)
But if he a G, it's a win, win (Win, win)
Can't play the queen before the king, king (King, king)
Bitch, I'm the Pinkprint, tell him to kiss the pink ring

[Chorus]
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm, I think I'm, I think I'm fallin' for you)

[Verse 2]
They like 'em, they fightin', they comin', they tuggin'
I kill 'em, I beat 'em, I see them, they duckin'
Got pitbulls, we feed 'еm, it's nothin'
They never been official, thеy never been a issue
Plus they know that my body tea, my middle initial
I let him kiss the real, he know my looks could kill
These bitches gotta shake they ass to show sex appeal

Picture that, picture me givin' bitches slack
Picture pretendin' I ain't give all these bitches piggyback
Picture usin' me and the Barbz and never givin' back
Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black
Ain't at the mall, but between me and them, it's a gap
Pictures sayin' that you the queen and knowin' it's a fact
Picture my hair givin' wet and wavy, strawberry daq'
Yo, matter fact, let me take that back before they steal that
Picture me openin' the vault, bitch, I seal that
Picture them disses stickin' like grits, bitches feel that
Picture me tellin' bitches ""catch it,"" outer field that
Picture me not tellin' my lil' niggas drill that
Picture you endin' up under the sea where the dread at
Picture not listenin' when I said you would dread that
I mean locs, ho, you's-you's a chop ho
I'm number one, y'all go argue over top four
Clean sweep, you gettin' mopped, ho
Picture me dressed in black, they callin' me Miss Mary Mack (Mary Mack)
You get the picture (Get the picture), my niggas airin' that
Like-like married to the mob, bitch, I'm married to the Makk
Picture it not gettin' scary, it's airier than Max

Hold, hold you
Let me hold you
Wanna hold, hold you
Let me hold you

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Pull off and I almost hit him
He actin' like I ain't always with him
My heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him
And ain't no more debatin', this time, it's a ultimatum
I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him
Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him
I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him
Twenty years later, them decisions, I don't regret them
Just wish you would give me space when I really need it
To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated
Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated
Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed
Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it
Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk
Just did a detox, now I wanna spar

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a sign for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so
Do you know?

Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart
She bad as fuck but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault
She got ambition like the niggas, and the vision for herself
So she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark
So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part
Sometimes you gotta play the back
But when you do, make sure you play it smart
All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard
They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a rated-R
You like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R
Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard
Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart
Yet you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across
But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God
To keep the family together at a time when it's so regular to break apart
So God forbid, y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought
It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath in your lungs
I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from
I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones
That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come
Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun
As if they life is somehow perfect and they never been plunged
Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done
It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]

You bitches look up to me
You said you look up to her, but really you look up to me
I can't be playin' with niggas, I married a G
I got some niggas that do what I say, if I tell 'em to shoot, they pull up from the three
When bitches be rappin', I'm laughin', it sound like you tryin' to me
I'm who you dyin' to be
Will somebody cop all these groupies a ticket? 'Cause I'm who they dyin' to meet
I'm in the city, I drop a location and all of the killers come out

Only on them C's if it's breeze, Red Ruby Da Sleeze  (Uh-oh, uh-oh)

Anyway, 你好 (你好, uh-oh)
Who the fuck told bitches they was me now? (Uh-oh, ooh)
I knew these bitches was slow, I ain't know these bitches senile (Ooh)
Married a shooter case you niggas tried to breathe loud (Brr-brr)
Boom your face off, then I tell him, ""Cease fire""
I'm the A, B side
Seven-hundred on them horses when we fixin' to leave (Uh-oh)
But I don't fuck with horses since Christopher Reeves (Uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Gotta be careful when I dip, it's flips all in the whip
It's 40s with 30 clips, FN's with the switch
Guacamole with the taco, waitin' on El Chapo
Came in the Rolls and left low in a Tahoe

Phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, ""What you gonna do with your life?""
Oh, Daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I could tell he the one 'cause they hated on him
Used to be a high roller, but I skated on him
When he went away, then I just waited on him
Came back, then I got X-rated on him
Never (Ah-ah), never hesitated on him
Even though I had to go up, elevated on him
Had the trap house, but it got raided on him
But I kept it real, player, never traded on him, uh
I mean, I wouldn't call 'em mini-me's
More like some goofy, doofy, raggedy-ass enemies
I mean, one thing for sure, ain't no forgettin' me
Me and my girls been them hoes, start weedin' them, uh
When the sun hit his eyes, like when a star-star tw-twinkle at night
Guys, I just can't say bye
Suddenly speak Thai, man, he samurai fly

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I can lick it, I can ride it while you slippin' and slidin'
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it, you can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me ’lone, he always tell me he miss it

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write ""pressure"" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)
P-P-P-Pressure applied, can’t fuck a regular guy
Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than apple pie

Ain't no need for you to double tap neither, scroll up

Fronto with the raw, how the gumbo roll
My nigga with the pot, it ain't gumbo though (Bahm, bahm)
Switchy on my hippy, sound like drumroll, ho

Switchin' up the plans if that dumb ho go
We out in SoHo, you just so-so, ho (Bahm, bahm)
Man, y'all know that bitch is wack, y'all gon' tell her or not?
Y'all report everything, y'all be tellin' a lot (Bahm, bahm)
Gotta tell my niggas chill 'fore they snap like 'Chat
Pussy and the crown, everything intact (Mm)

They say my price ridiculous, I don't like them bitches
Pussy tight and vicious, hit them likes to lick this (Oop; bahm, bahm)

I'm always up, ain't gotta ante
I ball hard, don't ever owe them like Lamy
Ayo, these bitches lucky that I still ain't find a nanny
All of them is my juniors, Sammy, uh
They know I pop up like jump rope
If-If the queen Sleeze put a bag on it, then it's gun smoke
So we ain't playin' on the internet
I got bigger fish to fry, that's why I got a bigger net

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj, Blondie]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me, but I shitted on him first
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, woah
Who real or fake? Sorry, baby, I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
They don't know me, but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life

How was I thinkin' 'bout you when I'm shakin' hands with your superior?

Never upset you, just wanted to sex you

I go at nine, yeah, I got a show tonight
But I ain't been feelin' right, all I see is blurry lines
Baby, would you tell 'em for me? I can hear them yellin' for me
Tell them I'm in Hell, ain't funny (Yeah, I'm in Hell, ain't funny)
Baby, now you gotta do it, keep drinkin' a lot of fluid
I'll be here to guide you through it (I'll be here to guide you through it)
And maybe I ain't got it in me, maybe it's just time to end it
I'm sorry, may God forgive me? (Did God forgive me? Tick-tock)

I 'member when I was the girl that everybody doubted
When every label turned me down, and then they laughed about it
I 'member goin' home and writin' fifty more raps
Just 'cause I knew you really wanted me to fall back
I 'member one of my first crushes in the fifth grade
He got killed, stabbed in the neck with a switchblade (Ooh)
I 'member when this girl in the hood thought she caught me slippin'
I got arrested, I assaulted with a deadly weapon
They say they hate Nicki, mad 'cause they ain't Nicki
All of the colors in the world, you couldn't paint Nicki (Ooh)
I never tried for that, these bitches die for that
I swear it, that's on my life, I'd never lie for that

[Chorus]
Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
They do
They do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
There's never been another you
You (Memories)

[Verse 3]
I told Drake that he don't owe me nothin', never did
I pray that Wayne always remembered that I never slid
Look at all the shit that y'all threw at me, and I never dipped
Greatest female rapper to ever live, and that's on my kid (Memories)
I could've overdosed, could've been comatosed
Wait, hold on, Juice, I feel the baby kickin', holy smokes
I prayed for a son, my husband wanted one
If they ask about me, tell 'em I was one of one
[Chorus]
Memories don't leave like people do (They don't leave like people do)
They'll always 'member you (They'll always remember you)
There's never been another you (There's never been another you)
Tell 'em I was one of one (You)

[Post-Chorus]
(So, so) Memories
(So, sad) Don't leave like people do

(Murda on the beat so it's not nice)
Ayo

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I drop a bag on the Rolls with the temp tags
My niggas locked, scammin' money out their pen pals
I know a bitch bust it open in the club
Introduce you to the plug, ten plates feel like ten cash
I got a call, told him, ""Meet me in the backstreets""
Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat
I'm not impressed, I said, ""Yo, the D mad weak""
Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat
I told him that he had the chance of a lifetime
Who wanna be a millionaire? I'm your lifeline
These bitches always checkin' for me like a Nike sign
Niggas always frontin' when they only did some light time

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Beep, beep, beep, is that bleep? (Bleep)
Is that you talkin' to me? It's that deep? (Deep)
If I don't even know you exist, is that beef? (Beef)
When niggas get they jaw broke, wait, is that teeth? (Is that teeth?)

I should spend that shit, then they spin that shit
If niggas ain't there, they gon' double back to finish it
Say, we got some kind of beef, what kind of beef? Please remind me
Niggas all pussy, whole clique punani
A lil' bread with me, you can't hide behind money
Got a lot of this shit, I ain't runnin' out of this shit
Nah, nah, you don't want to stop me, I don't stop
Have my niggas come to spin your block, around the clock
You don't see 'em out there, nigga, fuck it, make it hot
In front of the buildin', let him throw the shots
We gon' catch him in traffic

Ayo

[Verse 1]
Barbie dangerous
Weak bitches don't endanger us
You are over, you ain't in range of us
'Cause I won, won, won, won, angel numbers
Splash in some Burberry rain boots
Lookin' like every designer fave muse
Front row, next to the who's who
Tryna build another Barbie doll, screw's loose
Name a rapper that could channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear
Ho, I'm mother of the year
Every summer, I come out to walk bitches, make 'em disappear
But to me, it's just another year
She ain't got that kind of flair, let me see what I'ma wear
They gon' copy, I'ma wear Moncler
Heavy on the arch (Facts), he was hittin' from the back
Then he asked was all this my hair, um, yeah

[Chorus]
Spit your game, pop your shit
Face on pretty, ass stay thick
Beef with who? She got the right one
All these rap bitches, ain't got to like none
Kitty on fleek, I got the tight one
Pink one taken, I got the white one
These rap bitches you like is my sons
Still gon' run this rap shit when I'm done

I'm still sittin' here, you got a lot to prove
Appreciatin' my solitude
Beef ain't my go-to
But I got bags of this bread if we buyin' food
And I'm still queenin'
Chanel bags, they still swingin'
Old hits, they still swingin'
They love the flow, they still streamin'
But it's kill season
You apologized, but it's still treason
Got 'em steamin' like dry cleanin'
Move on my time and I ain't no demon
Hoes' words ain't got no meanin'
Queen of this rap shitty, Bohemian
They worst nightmare, they still dreamin'
Bitches jackin', I'm still queenin'
And I'm still prayin'
You would too if you knew
How these jealous bitches move
First .22 by twenty-two
They don't know the half 'til they cracked in two
So-called beef with who, wait, who?
Broke a couple rap niggas hearts in two
Now them ah chat pon interviews
It's clear to see they wanna be me
Hit the road, E-X-I-T
My flow, they B-I-T
Shots thrown, but I-D-C
Go home or do it B-I-G
My throne, they can't S-I-T
My crown, you can't F-I-T
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me

Hold, hold you
Let me hold you
Wanna hold, hold you
Let me hold you
Hold, hold you (Let me, let me, let me)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Pull off and I almost hit him
He actin' like I ain't always with him
My heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him
And ain't no more debatin', this time, it's a ultimatum
I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him
Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him
I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him
Twenty years later, them decisions, I don't regret them
Just wish you would give me space when I really need it
To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated
Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated
Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed
Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it
Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk
Just did a detox, now I wanna spar

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a sign for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so
Do you know?
For you, I promise I'll try
For you, I promise I'll try
For you, I promise I'll try

Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart
She bad as fuck but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault
She got ambition like the niggas, and the vision for herself
So she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark
So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part
Sometimes you gotta play the back
But when you do, make sure you play it smart
All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard
They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a rated-R
You like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R
Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard
Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart
Yet you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across
But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God
To keep the family together at a time when it's so regular to break apart
So God forbid, y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought
It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath in your lungs
I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from
I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones
That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come
Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun
As if they life is somehow perfect and they never been plunged
Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done
It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a sign for you to say you're beautiful

These bitches ain't battin' like me
You bitches ain't badder than me
You bitches don't count and these bitches can't count, I am not the one, two, or the three
You bitches look up to me
You said you look up to her, but really you look up to me
I can't be playin' with niggas, I married a G
I got some niggas that do what I say, if I tell 'em to shoot, they pull up from the three
When bitches be rappin', I'm laughin', it sound like you tryin' to me
I'm who you dyin' to be
Will somebody cop all these groupies a ticket? 'Cause I'm who they dyin' to meet
I'm in the city, I drop a location and all of the killers come out
These niggas be frontin' for y'all, but they play the back when them killers is out
When them killers is out, cut 'em off like the scissors is out
When Barbie touch down, the baddest of bitches is out

Married a shooter case you niggas tried to breathe loud (Brr-brr)
Boom your face off, then I tell him, ""Cease fire""

Seven-hundred on them horses when we fixin' to leave (Uh-oh)
But I don't fuck with horses since Christopher Reeves (Uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Gotta be careful when I dip, it's flips all in the whip
It's 40s with 30 clips, FN's with the switch
Guacamole with the taco, waitin' on El Chapo
Came in the Rolls and left low in a Tahoe

Phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, ""What you gonna do with your life?""
Oh, Daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I could tell he the one 'cause they hated on him
Used to be a high roller, but I skated on him
When he went away, then I just waited on him
Came back, then I got X-rated on him
Never (Ah-ah), never hesitated on him
Even though I had to go up, elevated on him
Had the trap house, but it got raided on him
But I kept it real, player, never traded on him, uh
I mean, I wouldn't call 'em mini-me's
More like some goofy, doofy, raggedy-ass enemies
I mean, one thing for sure, ain't no forgettin' me
Me and my girls been them hoes, start weedin' them, uh
When the sun hit his eyes, like when a star-star tw-twinkle at night

Suddenly speak Thai, man, he samurai fly

(Jess, your beat on the radio)
Ayo

[Verse 1]
There I go again, kickin' some dumb flow
Think they Harajuku, they just some young ho (Bahm, bahm)
Fronto with the raw, how the gumbo roll
My nigga with the pot, it ain't gumbo though (Bahm, bahm)
Switchy on my hippy, sound like drumroll, ho
I paid a couple bands, let the drumrolls go
Switchin' up the plans if that dumb ho go
We out in SoHo, you just so-so, ho (Bahm, bahm)
Man, y'all know that bitch is wack, y'all gon' tell her or not?
Y'all report everything, y'all be tellin' a lot (Bahm, bahm)
Gotta tell my niggas chill 'fore they snap like 'Chat
Pussy and the crown, everything intact (Mm)

[Chorus]
They say my price ridiculous, I don't like them bitches
Pussy tight and vicious, hit them likes to lick this (Oop; bahm, bahm)
Screamin', ""Fuck the opposition"" (Kyuh)
Totin' Glocks and switches, used to pots and dishes (Brr; bahm, bahm)
Got the Bentley 'cause that's just tradition
Made him drop his bitches just from pussy pictures (Kyuh; bahm, bahm)
Made him eat me, we don't swap positions
We don't talk on phones, don't put the cops in business (Bahm, bahm)

Bitches ain't blowin' up, they only blowin' the guys (Bahm, bahm)
Heavy on this side, everything is a vibe
I've been here for a minute, just enjoyin' the ride (Bahm, bahm)
Gabbana denim boots all the way to the thighs
Fit cost a grip, hope you enjoyin' the fly
A bitch been sittin' back, just lettin' you bitches lie
Throwin' your likkle shots, I've been lettin' 'em slide (Bahm, bahm)
Me against you, you know who they gon' decide
Tryin' to be down, application denied (Bahm, bahm)
He could tell this pussy good by the look in my eye
Don't ever run up on me 'less you lookin' to die (Mm)

I'm always up, ain't gotta ante
I ball hard, don't ever owe them like Lamy
Ayo, these bitches lucky that I still ain't find a nanny
All of them is my juniors, Sammy, uh
They know I pop up like jump rope
If-If the queen Sleeze put a bag on it, then it's gun smoke
So we ain't playin' on the internet
I got bigger fish to fry, that's why I got a bigger net

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj, Blondie]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me, but I shitted on him first
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, woah
Who real or fake? Sorry, baby, I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
They don't know me, but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life
They gon' talk about me whether I'm wrong or I'm right
I don't need no more drama in my life
My life, my life, my life (My life)

[Chorus: Future]
Let me just be honest this one time

Think that it's special, fallin' for weakness
We ain’t that different

[Verse 1: Future]
I saw all my missed texts, I wanted to clear 'em
I feel like if he really love you, how you let my love near you?
Girl, open your fears up, I had to tear up
How was I thinkin' 'bout you when I'm shakin' hands with your superior?
I knew you was somethin' serious, wanted to protect you
Never upset you, just wanted to sex you
Never, ever would’ve left you
Tell me, I’ll come back and get you
He give you issues
But never no tissues

Wish I'da known in that instant

Them nights we wish never ended

But I ain't been feelin' right, all I see is blurry lines
Baby, would you tell 'em for me? I can hear them yellin' for me
Tell them I'm in Hell, ain't funny (Yeah, I'm in Hell, ain't funny)
Baby, now you gotta do it, keep drinkin' a lot of fluid
I'll be here to guide you through it (I'll be here to guide you through it)
And maybe I ain't got it in me, maybe it's just time to end it
I'm sorry, may God forgive me? (Did God forgive me? Tick-tock)

I 'member when I was the girl that everybody doubted
When every label turned me down, and then they laughed about it
I 'member goin' home and writin' fifty more raps
Just 'cause I knew you really wanted me to fall back
I 'member one of my first crushes in the fifth grade
He got killed, stabbed in the neck with a switchblade (Ooh)
I 'member when this girl in the hood thought she caught me slippin'
I got arrested, I assaulted with a deadly weapon
They say they hate Nicki, mad 'cause they ain't Nicki
All of the colors in the world, you couldn't paint Nicki (Ooh)
I never tried for that, these bitches die for that
I swear it, that's on my life, I'd never lie for that

I pray that Wayne always remembered that I never slid
Look at all the shit that y'all threw at me, and I never dipped
Greatest female rapper to ever live, and that's on my kid (Memories)
I could've overdosed, could've been comatosed
Wait, hold on, Juice, I feel the baby kickin', holy smokes
I prayed for a son, my husband wanted one

I 'member when I was the girl that everybody doubted
When every label turned me down, and then they laughed about it
I 'member goin' home and writin' fifty more raps
Just 'cause I knew you really wanted me to fall back
I 'member one of my first crushes in the fifth grade
He got killed, stabbed in the neck with a switchblade (Ooh)
I 'member when this girl in the hood thought she caught me slippin'
I got arrested, I assaulted with a deadly weapon
They say they hate Nicki, mad 'cause they ain't Nicki
All of the colors in the world, you couldn't paint Nicki (Ooh)
I never tried for that, these bitches die for that
I swear it, that's on my life, I'd never lie for that

[Chorus]
Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
They do
They do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
There's never been another you
You (Memories)

[Verse 3]
I told Drake that he don't owe me nothin', never did
I pray that Wayne always remembered that I never slid
Look at all the shit that y'all threw at me, and I never dipped
Greatest female rapper to ever live, and that's on my kid (Memories)
I could've overdosed, could've been comatosed
Wait, hold on, Juice, I feel the baby kickin', holy smokes
I prayed for a son, my husband wanted one
If they ask about me, tell 'em I was one of one
[Chorus]
Memories don't leave like people do (They don't leave like people do)
They'll always 'member you (They'll always remember you)
There's never been another you (There's never been another you)
Tell 'em I was one of one (You)

[Post-Chorus]
(So, so) Memories
(So, sad) Don't leave like people do
(So, fast) No, no, no

You bitches look up to me
You said you look up to her, but really you look up to me
I can't be playin' with niggas, I married a G
I got some niggas that do what I say, if I tell 'em to shoot, they pull up from the three
When bitches be rappin', I'm laughin', it sound like you tryin' to me
I'm who you dyin' to be
Will somebody cop all these groupies a ticket? 'Cause I'm who they dyin' to meet
I'm in the city, I drop a location and all of the killers come out

Anyway, 你好 (你好, uh-oh)
Who the fuck told bitches they was me now? (Uh-oh, ooh)
I knew these bitches was slow, I ain't know these bitches senile (Ooh)
Married a shooter case you niggas tried to breathe loud (Brr-brr)
Boom your face off, then I tell him, ""Cease fire""
I'm the A, B side
Seven-hundred on them horses when we fixin' to leave (Uh-oh)
But I don't fuck with horses since Christopher Reeves (Uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Gotta be careful when I dip, it's flips all in the whip
It's 40s with 30 clips, FN's with the switch
Guacamole with the taco, waitin' on El Chapo
Came in the Rolls and left low in a Tahoe

Ayo, these bitches lucky that I still ain't find a nanny
All of them is my juniors, Sammy, uh
They know I pop up like jump rope
If-If the queen Sleeze put a bag on it, then it's gun smoke
So we ain't playin' on the internet
I got bigger fish to fry, that's why I got a bigger net

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj, Blondie]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me, but I shitted on him first
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, woah
Who real or fake? Sorry, baby, I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
They don't know me, but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life

Yo, Patty, give me the gun back
When he say cock it back, gun off safety

Gyal, them want me face, but them gyal, they can't face me
I-I ain't really tryna let him in, in (In, in)
But if he a G, it's a win, win (Win, win)
Can't play the queen before the king, king (King, king)
Bitch, I'm the Pinkprint, tell him to kiss the pink ring

Got pitbulls, we feed 'еm, it's nothin'

Picture pretendin' I ain't give all these bitches piggyback
Picture usin' me and the Barbz and never givin' back
Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black
Ain't at the mall, but between me and them, it's a gap
Pictures sayin' that you the queen and knowin' it's a fact
Picture my hair givin' wet and wavy, strawberry daq'
Yo, matter fact, let me take that back before they steal that
Picture me openin' the vault, bitch, I seal that
Picture them disses stickin' like grits, bitches feel that
Picture me tellin' bitches ""catch it,"" outer field that
Picture me not tellin' my lil' niggas drill that
Picture you endin' up under the sea where the dread at
Picture not listenin' when I said you would dread that

Beggin' me to stay, and then you walk away
There's somethin' that you wanted to say
I was in a rush, but you said you were crushed
And I said, ""I'd be back, it's okay""

[Chorus]
I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you
I wish l didn't waste precious time the night when I called you
I wish I remembered to say I'd do anything for you
Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd bore you

[Verse 2]
Listen
So close, but we were so distant
Wish I'da known in that instant
Ignored the hints or I missed it
I killed it
You'd always be in attendance
No flights, but always attеndant
Handwritten letter, you pеnned it
Them nights we wish never ended
Those rules that we wish we bended
Heartbreak that we never mended
Those messages we unsended
Best friends we somehow unfriended
Ain't care 'bout who we offended
Parties they wish we attended
Got drunk and laughed, it was splendid

They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive

Hundred rounds on that, grrah-ta-ta
Real one lick a shot-ta-ta
She my lil' vibe, my lil' ah-ah-ah

Rude boy want me touchin' on his body, like yah
Boy affi dead if he ever diss me
You know what to do if he ever miss me

[Verse 2]
When the Queen leave, bitches wanna come out like a cockroach
Until I'm cookin' in the kitchen like a pot roast
That new Spectre, we don't fill pot holes
Dorito—bitches mad that they not chose
Shout out my vatos
Shout out to hoes that's watchin' me like Movados (Click, click, click)
All them, all them botched face photos, why would you post those?
Make a gyal duppy since I heard you like my ghost hoes
Big truck but I'm alone like Post though
Call Malone and tell him I'm goin' postal (Brr)
These bitches rappin' like my blooper roll
Desert Eagle if your nigga actin' super bold
(Got 'em, got 'em, got 'em) Got 'em like ""Uh-oh""
Gun fingers like niggas doin' the bogle
Ya fuckin' bozo
That .40 cal a make 'em dance like a go-go
Super fakks, that's word to Super Cat
We ah rude gyal youth and we nuh tek back we chat
'Cause bitches couldn't walk in my Crocs, that's word to Dundee
Just a bunch of airheads like Kelly Bundy
Man, these bitches so slow, man, they slower than sloths
Six-hundred horse, how you gon' catch the boss?
Caught 'em with they hand out, tryna catch the sauce
Thierry Mugler flow tryna cut the cloth
See the difference is I run businesses
If I ain't employ you, then what ya business is?
I'll have staff roll up, like what the business is?
""Oh, you don't know that my niggas kill witnesses?""
[Chorus]
Bad gyal don't die-die-die
Hundred rounds on that, grrah-ta-ta
Real one lick a shot-ta-ta
She my lil' vibe, my lil' ah-ah-ah
Bad gyal don't run from nobody, like ah
Rude boy want me touchin' on his body, like yah
Boy affi dead if he ever diss me
You know what to do if he ever miss me, yeahEmbed"

One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write ""pressure"" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)
P-P-P-Pressure applied, can’t fuck a regular guy

I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma
""Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,"" asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

[Verse 4: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

Ain't no fun by yourself, bring a friend or two
We be ménaging, that boost up his ego
She a lil' demon off that Casamigos
Yeah, Baby
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Tell 'em my Nina, my bitch, she a rider
I got a shooter and I got a driver
They want that heat, I'm the only provider
Little bad foreign bitch, word to Fivio
Niggas know the vibe, that's word to Five, yo
Beef, we 'bout to resolve, yo
Pull up on a opp, do we have a problem?

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
There's no autotune on me, is there? (Nope)
Don't mean a rapper when I say bitches ride the wave
Floodin' my watch, but ain't givin' a clown the time of day
Ain't-ain't talkin' Christmas, wouldn't holla in my holidays
I-I fuck with niggas that be shootin' at they opps for days
Trust me (Trust me), they gon' let me know (Know)
They gon' rep me when they catch you lackin'

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne)]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want

Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me, ""Make me a wife""
I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slay Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of (Yeah)
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up

Now, if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, ""Park it""

Uh, mmm, kyuh

Classic shit

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

I remember when I used to have a crush on Special Ed
Shoutout Desiigner 'cause he made it out of special ed
You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?""
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', ""Gang! Gang!""
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said ""tre-way""
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

[Verse 1]
He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a do-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
""S"" on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me ""mama, lil' mama,"" I call him ""baby""

When I was a Geisha, he was a Samurai
Somehow, I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you and gettin' at you
Pickin' up dishes, throwin' 'em at you
Why are you speakin' when no one asked you?

Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can

You could turn a free throw to a goal

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah)
Bae gave it to me (Hmm)
You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, ""Who asked y'all?""
Cita told me to stunt my ass off, that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, ""Bad kall,"" that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, ""Keep me clean,"" the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', ""Free Drizzy""
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, ""I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit""
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch

Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic
One Margherita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me ""Nicki, cock the blicky,"" the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, ""Well, bitch, come and convince me""
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene
[Break: Drake]
You know, one of the perils of makin' money is
You can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin'
Man, what's up? We in this bitch

[Verse 3: Drake]
This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, ""Nice to meet ya""
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade
None of this shit's a mirage
Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green

Bae out in Paris, he told me to pick a ride
Sike, made you look, I still didn't pick a guy
I'm the trophy of the game, everybody tryna win me
Me, Olivier, Jourdan Dunn, my baby, Winnie
Partying in Paris, these bitches is embarrassed
'Cause they know I'm the queen, I still didn't pick an heiress
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest?

With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call 'em cashews

Okay, so when I'm in the hills, I hang with Kristin Cavallari
And when I'm in Miami, I'm with Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe
And when I'm in the A, I'm with Ciara or it's Keri
I'm feeling like a diva, then I hit Mariah Carey
I'm in the UK, I'ma see M.I.A
Superhero by night, r-r-rapper by day
And if I just wanna talk, I'ma hit up Monique
If I need a bad bitch, Angelina Jolie (Ooh)
Material girls like Madonna, model for Donatella
Ain't nothing you can tell her 'cause she get the mozzarella
She look just like Rihanna
She work with Wilhelmina, only rocking Galliano
She might be Filipino, be sipping Pellegrino
Be watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo
Anyway, yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said Strangé
I'm out in Paris, motherfucker, with Beyoncé

I can lick it, I can ride it while you slippin' and slidin'

One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write ""pressure"" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)
P-P-P-Pressure applied, can’t fuck a regular guy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, ""Who asked y'all?""
Cita told me to stunt my ass off, that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, ""Bad kall,"" that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, ""Keep me clean,"" the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', ""Free Drizzy""
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, ""I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit""
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi

Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic
One Margherita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me ""Nicki, cock the blicky,"" the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, ""Well, bitch, come and convince me""
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene
[Break: Drake]
You know, one of the perils of makin' money is
You can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin'
Man, what's up? We in this bitch

[Verse 3: Drake]
This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, ""Nice to meet ya""
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade
None of this shit's a mirage

I fell back, I had a baby, you know
I did the mother thing, I did the wife thing
All that, yeah (All that shit)
But I think it's quite clear now
You's need the bad guy

[Verse]
Ayo, I'm the one who run the city where they armed and vicious
Accusations on them blogs and they all fictitious
I done bent the realest blocks, pushed the hardest sixes
Keep a couple killers that don't care how far them licks is, look
Bitches act like they want action
Heard they want action
Bitch, we ain't duckin' no action
I'm 'bout to give them that traction, send a distraction
Then I'ma line 'еm like fractions
Took a break, I let 'еm live, look at all 'em eatin'
But these bitches gon' be mad once I call this meetin'
'Cause they gotta move around once the queen is queenin'
'Bout to put out all this crack 'cause my fiends is feenin', uh
I put these bitches on game, they should be kissin' my feet
I tried to give 'em some press, they tried to say it was beef
It's Nicki M, such a little gem
Bitches wanna be around me, but I do not fuck with them
All these diamonds on me flooded, I hope nobody gets stuck
If I pull out the Ferrari, then my shooters in the truck
I could still go to my hood, they know my body is good
Two million dollars to party in Saudi Arabian clubs
Poppin' them things to go up and smokin' Los Angeles bud
These bitches bitin' like Joe; shout out to Kamala, though (What up?)
It's them weak bars thinkin' that she dissin' for me
I graded your homework, bitch, it's incomplete
If you was tryna be my son, then mission complete
I'm the final level bitch they on a mission to beat
It's like COVID when the goat is on the track, the whole game stop
But I ain't playin' with these bitches, this ain't GameStop
If Barbie in the buildin', then she with a gangsta
He ain't gon' hesitate if I tell him to shank sumn
Just put a beauty parlor in my guest house
You mean the pink Lamborghini? That's at the next house
Fuck him so good, I got him walkin' with his chest out
I wish these bitches wanted more talent and less clout
I-I fall back, and just give them some space
'Cause when you already won, what the fuck is a race?
Look at them fuckin' for raps, oh, what a disgrace
I put that on A-rod, none of you bitches is safe (Uh)
Make his dick get hard soon as I brush up, but we tryna be subtle
Whole city go up when a bitch touch down like them niggas in a huddle
Sex game still cold, it's on igloo
Head game slicker than little miss Gorilla Glue

Mmm, uhh

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ain't yellin' cut, when it's shootin' time
Sign up, it's recruitin' time
Big wigs, with a suit and tie
And them big things got two inside
Fuck wrong wit' these ho niggas?
Don't do coke, I don't blow niggas
I don't tell niggas, I show niggas
And it's never less than like four niggas
(Four-four) Four wings and some french fries
Hot sauce and ketchup, nigga
He telling and he hiding
But real niggas still catch a nigga
Co-cop 'Raris, I don't test drive 'em
Home theaters, can't Best Buy 'em
These niggas that I roll with
Don't let a single thing get by 'em
Ki-king pins and them drug lords
Chi-Chi-Town, no gun laws
Broke bitches that talk shit?
Now them the bitches I stunt for
Malcolm X daughter came at me
Look-lookin' ass niggas ain't happy
Roll-rolled out with some Latin Kings
And some eses in 'em plain khakis
Smack bitches, no smack cam
Closed fists, no back hands
Pop-pop pussy on a hand stand
They suckin' dick like it's band camp
Call-call-call Webb and then call Nitti
Queens niggas in, it's all hoodies
Kidnappin' and then rob niggas
Call D-Roc for a biggie
Pussy ass little rap niggas
I fucked with real trap niggas
Pop star, i-icon
But I send niggas, come snatch niggas
I'm with EBK, you on EBT
Got a black nine, call it BET
School niggas, get a GED
And I tease niggas, make em B-E-G
Got a money fetish, I'ma fly to Venice
Got a big house, I can play some tennis
Lil Herb, what's good?
I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good

Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
1-50, I'm really with it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man 'round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
I'm a young nigga, I be gettin' money
Take your bitch from you
And these niggas don't get no respect
I'ma stay 100 'til I'm six under
Matter fact, I gotta keep it 150
For every nigga that's gon' come with me
I'm on Roc Block with a new semi
And a blue Bentley, it do 160
Smoke a lot a of weed, like fuck kidneys
Put a dutch in me, got a .40 on me
I don't trust any, and if any nigga ever try to end me
I'ma die shooting, prayin' God forgive me
You too busy hating, you can't get no paper
Why are y'all so silly? Straight killers
I can call so many, I don't love no bitches
But my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki
I'm in Hollywood, came from Kingston Food
Shorties standing, in the streets with tools
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang, we don't say no names
If you talk to cops, I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station, in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Lead to domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Puttin' my relations, in your conversations
Shoot a opposition, with no hesitation
You get my position, then you better take it
Know some young bulls from a while back
Tryna leave the game but they never made it
I got old shit, killin' your shit
On a couple tracks I just never played it
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
[Chorus: G Herbo]
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
One-fifty, I'm really with it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man 'round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

[Outro: G Herbo & Nicki Minaj]
Gang, gang, gang shit man
You already know how I'm rocking man
This is G Herbo, shout out Nicki Minaj, you already know man
SB just gave me the .9 with the green beam
Just give me the green light
Letting niggas have it man
We pulling up anywhere wetting shit man
Got 50s in them TECs, 50s in them MACs man
30s in them Glocks, 17 shot Berettas, all that shit man
Sawed offs, pumps man what you want?
How you want it, where you want
When you want it man, let's get it
And I ride dolo from state to state
Even when I ain't 150 man Chiraq all the way to Queens
Let's get it
Uh-huh, I always got a trick up my sleeve
I might give you a new trick every week
'Til this album drop, I don't know
I figured they want some more, I'ma give you some more
Ask Webb if I wasn't taking them trips, with 'em nigga!

Never let a clown nigga try to play you
If he play you, then rule number two
Fuck his best friends then make 'em yes-men
And get a dick pic and then you press send
And send a red heart and send a kissy face
And tell him that his friends love how your pussy taste

I said, ""Damn, man, go back to whoring""

You know I'm still bad and I'm still foreign
I-I-I'ma give bitches time to get hot
Chill out at the game, New York Knickerbock'
If they actually got bars, they could rock
But if not, I'ma destroy chicks a lot, oh

Just dropped this freestyle 'fore these files get old
When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound
When I come back, they better not make a sound

You know, it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj, hahaha, oh

[Verse 1]
I ain't know the president live in DC
And I ain't know they call me Nicki Lewinsky
I never knew that dude with Jay was Pimp C
And I ain't know I be with Paris and Lindsay
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
I fly girl pop up, and I fly girl dip
I fly girl stunt like a fly girl flip
And I don't never guzzle it, I fly girl sip

[Pre-Chorus]
Now get that Rosé, get that, get that Rosé
A little Hennessy and Louis the 13th
Now everybody look my way, my way
Excuse all my haters 'cause they looking sideways
Let's get it now, c'yeah

[Chorus]
You got me wrong
You be sittin' by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do

I ain't know the police was the Babylon
I ain't know I'm cold just like an avalanche
I never knew my titties was bigger than Pamela
So paparazzi flicking, be flicking their camera

My fly girl stomach and my fly girl hips
I fly girl ball, with my fly girl mitts
And I can only kiss another fly girl lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Now get that OJ, get that, get that OJ
A little cranberry and some Rémy Moné
Now everybody look my way, my way
Excuse all the haters cause they looking sideways
Let's get it now, c'yeah

That cherry coke got stupid dough
Plenty mo', you think I booked a
Hundred, shows I'm selling dope

Sippin lean and burnin piff
You gotta fifth, I gotta pint
You took a shot, I took a sip
I plead the 5th, ain't saying shit
Go get my lawyer, get him quick
Spent 80 grand to beat a case
I whipped it like my purple whip
I call a hit like Sosa did
Them killas blitz ya house ya monkey
I got so much jewelry on me
Still you can't take nothing from me
Hook it up, I cook it up
And get some head while rolling blunts
Water paint, water stain
I'm lookin' down, she lookin' up
Beamer truck, I rim it up
Spent 80 thou', 400 stones
She suck a dick while rollin' blunt
She keep the boss man bustin' nuts
I get it off, she get it up
Me and her both can't get enough
We in the goat, I'm in the ghost
I'm tryna beat that pussy up

If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard

You would never let another girl sit in your throne

Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch, buzz me in (Bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lamby
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good
I don't wanna hear what you woulda, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)
These birds all fly south in the winter (Uh)
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle? (C'yeah)
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Hahahahahaha, no muzzle)
What you wanna do, do, do? (C'yeah)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelie-in' them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees
Kisses to my fans unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kind of rocky

But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip

But I can still make you tumble and flip

'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money dungeon, bitch, my swagger just punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun ""Gunović""

Come on now, they done, they know I do it
They know when I do it it get done, two sticks in my bun
But, but first of all, when I say ""two sticks in my bun""
I mean that, when I put a bun in my hair
Like, when I put my hair in a ponytail and I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
'Cause y'all, y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?
But Holiday, you already know, y'knahmsayin?
They heard that hard spittin', they heard that fast shit
Now, you know, you gotta slow it down for them, you know?
Um, they wanna hear me sing
You know, behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly girl
There's a really sweet Harajuku Barbie, and, um
Now it's time for them to hear me get all nice and soft and moist
I mean, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that
I meant, this is the portion of the tape where
I just wanna be more, you know, delicate and wet (splash)
I'm, I'm, I'm so... I, I didn't mean to say that

Yeah, Nicki Minaj, Young Money
Yeah, Drizzy's home, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)

You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking...

[Verse 1: Drake & Trey Songz]
Know you got a roommate, call me when its no one there
Put the key under the mat, and you know I'll be over there (Yup!)
I'll be over there, shawty I'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there
Ha! And you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chilling with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm working, I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one to never get confused with, 'cause...

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, you the only one that see the real Nicki
I can show you ""Chill Nicki"" 'cause of how you deal wit me
When they knock my blocks down
You come and you build with me
Even though you real busy, you still fuckin' real Drizzy
It's so amazing
I figured out this world is ours for the taking
I figured out that when I go out and all those people scream
That's some of them are living vicariously through me
That's why I put that ""S"" on my chest and I'm gone
But on another note, let's have sex in my dorm
And I'ma make you beg, 'cause you look pretty when you beggin'
So meet me on the campus, I'll be there around eleven
So let me put my books down (Down)
Excuse me if I look down (Down)
Guess I'm a little nervous, but I'm at your service
Look at what you took down (Down)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee, 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double-cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix? Then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back, and make your fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots
I'm saying!
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it

It's like, I get chills down my spine, when I'm near him
Man, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him
I don't need the preachers, I'm the high priestess (Kyuh, kyuh)
Everywhere I go, I get ""Hi, nice to meet you""
Bitches know I beast this, I'm the fashionistis
And they know, I stay around the white, like a groom (Huh)
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom (Woah, oh)
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high, on my own supply (Uh-huh)
Yellin' ""Rastafari! "" when I'm ridin' by
See, I used to be the wife, of a king (Yeah)
Back when I was smugglin' them things, in the bing (Holiday Season!)
Now that I'm a boss bitch, it's a win-win (Uh-huh)
Come to Mr. Chow's, or meet me in Chin-Chin (Okay)
Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring - (What up?)
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding! (Kyuh, kyuh)

[Chorus]
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'

I eat these rap bitches, somebody get me a dinner mint
Pussy make him tattoo my name upon his ligament
Fuck wrong with them, my nerves they keep tweaking'
Tell them I'm the chief, I'm runnin' with Mohikans
Tell them this is church, and tell them I am the deacon
Tell them that I'm Black, Chinese, and Butter Pecan
Pull up in the Range, I'm givin' them more reasons
Hit up Lil Wayne, while I'm in the 4 Seasons
Tell Gudda, Mack, and Kidd Kidd I'm here
I'm colder than a cough, I'm wetter than swimwear
Got all these little bitches, g-gettin' p-pink hair
I'm pretty and I'm fly, I'm up in the pink Lear
I needed an assistant, I got me a pink queer
Decorated his office, with flowers and pink chairs (C'yeah)

Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
'Cause I pack shows, sell ticks like Boston
Pat your back, ho, why the fuck they coughin'?
Oh, I got 'em sick, better get that coffin
I say coffin, you can say casket
They're so trash, but where's the waste basket?
Where's my hat and where's my straitjacket?
Yup, they jackin', back to Maybachin'
Everything I do, bitches wanna do it too
I guess-guess you just skip to my lou
I just came through, I flew to St. Lou
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ
Why is it that they make Nicki a target?
Just 'cause this lil' piggy went to the market
Marketing steps, they marketed sex

Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
'Cause now I see-see-see-see, all your run-down
Niggas better have my money by sundown
'Cause now when I come through, I'm stylin' on 'em
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos, did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi

Tell that bitch jump, if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up, in the middle of the ring

Pay attention
If you move, I'll fall
(Davaughn on the beat)
I'm leanin on you, you baby, you baby
Trap-A-Holics

[Verse]
Yo, yo, I push, p-p-push it, I push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me to love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
(Holiday Season!)
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nick of time it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroine
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
(I'm so Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn)
Yo, write it down, take a picture, bitches, e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap (Female Rap)
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade, then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty-nose hood rat
""I love Nicki"" scribbled all over you book bag (Book bag)
I love you too (Love you too)
I just wish your mother would've hugged you too (Hugged you too)
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road, lookin' for the Wiz (For the Wiz)
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D (They got A.D.D)
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school (Ready for school)

Let me say my prayers and get ready for school
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it)

She tryna be like Lil' Kim, her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality, she Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch, fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin

Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body

G-Game over, locker room, hit them showers now
I got the trophies and the catalogue
Just did a deal, Mercedes-Benz, check the catalogue
I'm buyin' buildings, we don't buy the blogs (Kyuh)
The Nicki challenge when I fly to Prague, uh

[Refrain: Labrinth]
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, who want it with Nicki now?
I smoke ’em like hippies now
They see me, say, ""Yippie,"" now
Homes runnin’ like Griffey now
They switchin' like sissies now
You niggas is iffy now
Bitches tune switchin’ up
We take 'em to Jiffy now

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (Oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also
Someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed
But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear, all nice and easy
As hair when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle (Oh)
[Verse 3: Eminem]
She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is over
Think that shit's got pneumonia""
I told her, ""Bitch, now, just hold up!""
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital: we need Q-Tip for the culture
(Speed it up a little bit)
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I want to accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire Mead pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it 100
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah
[Chorus: Labrinth]
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, now let me hit you back
Told 'em I'd get you back
I know you sittin' there just thinkin' 'bout who did you that
I am who did you that
You trippin', did you pack?
Can't post on Nicki block unless you sellin' Nicki crack
Here, take a Nicki pack
Check out this Nicki act

All these bitches piggyback
Ha, piggyback, ah, ah, ah back

Uh, mmm, kyuh

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?""
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake

Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'

You think pussy's everything? Well, let's have a chat
A-a-a-ass out, pussy fat, point me to a rich nigga

If I hit you, then you probably gon' sue

Always sayin' what somebody won't do?
Who the fuck gon’ pull up in your city, lookin' every bit of pretty

They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill level still just a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I wash bitches take a bath for me
Bunch of trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them giving fake love but that trash is weak

Gave you everything, everything, everything, everything, everything

[Chorus]
Gave you everything, yeah
Think I need to take it all back (Take it all back, hey)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you (Yeah, brr)
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

[Verse 1]
Mmm, see, I used to curve niggas like you
Skrr, skrr, swerve niggas like you
Even though I heard what you might do
I didn't get concerned 'cause I liked you
But no, no, I can't hide who you are
I can't lie, it's too hard (So hard, so hard)
I need more than what you got from me
You want a bad bitch and new cars

[Verse 3]
Yo, give up on 'em, I don't even wanna get up on 'em
And I ain't tryna work it out
But I'm at the gym on a mat doin' sit-ups on 'em
You let yourself go, you don't represent O’
So trust me, just go
You settle for less, yo, you disrespectful
You was special, the new you just dull
So cut all that bull, the nerve of me to come off my pedestal
Come off my pedestal, money off that edible
Which means them bags stacked high
You ain't got the drive, my nigga ya pedal stalled
You said you wept, aww, every day, a queen you slept on
And I ain't talkin' 'bout your mattresses
But um, you the type of player I press eject on
I can't believe you played for that long
I never re-respected nobody
I never needed you, you must've thought I did
I should have copped the stick, but I'm teflon
Pressed on, headstrong, sex the bomb
Dreams of a bad bitch tryna F a don
If his word bond and he wanna sex icons
If he bust down and don't wanna waste my time
Who the fuck you thought you was, tryna stunt on Nick?
Shoulda put you on blast like a gun on hip
But it's okay, we gon' keep secrets, nigga
'Cause a true bad bitch ain't weak or bitter26Embed"

Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money (Go!)

I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' ""push"" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign

So he tryna smash like when the whip flips

And when I leave my bitches, we all say, ""Kiss, kiss""
I'm in that new new De La Renta, channeling Bugs Bunny
'Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me
The jig up, it's a stick up, run me the money (Go!)

When you make that ass jump like my heartbeat
And if you let me eat the pussy, then it's shark week
""Hello, may I speak to Tunechi?"" May I ask who's callin'?
Everybody got the juice without a glass to pour it
I want my cake and eat it, too, and after that, I'm starving
I feel like Adam, but I'm 'bout to eat a apple on you, uh
Rollie on the right side, now y'all on my time
Please get off my dick before it turn into a pipe bomb
Eyes lookin' like I'm somewhere outta Taiwan
Faded as fuck as always, hi mom
Look dude, I'll stomp your ass out in my good shoes
Be my foot stool
Told my lawyer don't call me 'less it's good news
Then my phone started ringing off the hook, snooze, brrr

Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns

Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
Fuck yeah, 'cause a Queen is what I embody, uh

Someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed
But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear, all nice and easy
As hair when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle (Oh)
[Verse 3: Eminem]
She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is over
Think that shit's got pneumonia""
I told her, ""Bitch, now, just hold up!""
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital: we need Q-Tip for the culture
(Speed it up a little bit)
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I want to accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire Mead pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it 100
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I know what these niggas like, and it ain't my charm
I ain't stupid, this two-hundred fifty on my arm
I like money more than dick, nigga, that's a fact
You think pussy's everything? Well, let's have a chat
A-a-a-ass out, pussy fat, point me to a rich nigga
Who gon' Rico, Ace me, pay in full my money, Mitch nigga?
I'ma help him fuck the check up, I'ma run the business
If your girl don't get it poppin', put me on your wishlist
Hitlist, now he sendin' gifts like if it's Christmas
He say, ""Baby, every day we ballin',"" I say, ""Swish, swish""
Got him callin' nonstop 'cause he don't wanna miss this
I said, ""Don't panic, keep the faith, nigga, B.I.G.'s bitch""
(Real rich nigga sex)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck (Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up (Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer (Rich sex)

I feel like I'm King Kong, name still going ding-dong
It's two girls gettin' more money, and they don't rap, they sing songs
I stay with that pink on, pink furs and them pink thongs
Goons out if they blink wrong, think hard, but don't think long
Pink Friday had Eminem, spit hard but I'm feminine
Iconic trio on Monster, Goblins and Gremlins
What's left that I didn't do? You bit the forbidden fruit
You thought you'd get my spot? Who the fuck was kiddin' you?
Took a lil' break, but I'm back to me
Tryna make a new Nicki, where the factory?
They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill level still just a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I wash bitches take a bath for me
Bunch of trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them giving fake love but that trash is weak
Man, you know that I ripped, every rapper beat
You know Nicki gon' eat, Bon Appétit
Used to get real hype off a half a mil'
Used to get real high off a half a pill

I ain't really finna tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit

Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I flew in from Trinidad, peep this nigga pressin'
I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'ma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in
None of you bum bitches can't sit with me and Gretchen
It's the biggest, a bitch ain't cough one time, it's the sickest
I don't never clique up, but they know who the clique is
Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest
Mortal Kombat, ninja Nicki, who ya pick is?

Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki?)
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
Fuck yeah, 'cause a Queen is what I embody, uh

[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah

You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, yeah, you Nas, bae
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes, whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat, and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I’m Kobe, KD, Kyrie, pick a K

She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (Oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also
Someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed
But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear, all nice and easy
As hair when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle (Oh)
[Verse 3: Eminem]
She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is over
Think that shit's got pneumonia""
I told her, ""Bitch, now, just hold up!""
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital: we need Q-Tip for the culture
(Speed it up a little bit)
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I want to accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire Mead pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it 100
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah
[Chorus: Labrinth]
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya

Yo, now let me hit you back
Told 'em I'd get you back

I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit

Stuff a couple stacks up in there, bitch, get on your feet
You'd make twice as much if you switch it up, just to see

Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
You see a bad bitch coming through, yo, what's the hold up?
I'm in that new new, me and New New when I roll up
I tell the valet, ""Park my Benz and bring the Rolls up""
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
He see me lookin' pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money (Go!)

Come off my pedestal, money off that edible

You ain't got the drive, my nigga ya pedal stalled
You said you wept, aww, every day, a queen you slept on
And I ain't talkin' 'bout your mattresses
But um, you the type of player I press eject on
I can't believe you played for that long
I never re-respected nobody
I never needed you, you must've thought I did
I should have copped the stick, but I'm teflon
Pressed on, headstrong, sex the bomb
Dreams of a bad bitch tryna F a don
If his word bond and he wanna sex icons
If he bust down and don't wanna waste my time

Shoulda put you on blast like a gun on hip
But it's okay, we gon' keep secrets, nigga

Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

I flew in from Trinidad, peep this nigga pressin'
I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'ma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in
None of you bum bitches can't sit with me and Gretchen
It's the biggest, a bitch ain't cough one time, it's the sickest
I don't never clique up, but they know who the clique is
Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest

Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns

Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
Fuck yeah, 'cause a Queen is what I embody, uh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is over
Think that shit's got pneumonia""
I told her, ""Bitch, now, just hold up!""
That's why rap needs a doctor

Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire Mead pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it 100
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang

Hitlist, now he sendin' gifts like if it's Christmas
He say, ""Baby, every day we ballin',"" I say, ""Swish, swish""

Fall off in the spot
Wait up, they gon' do it while you drop
Metro!
Pull up with no top
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
And you know my necklace, sittin' on ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fin pick you apart
Glowin' in the dark, fifty some' girls on board
Runnin' with the marksmen, everything on point like, ""En garde!""

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I'm me, I'm Barbie drippin'
DB9, Barbie whippin'
If he say he don't want me back, he be lyin'
Bitch, I'm the sauce, Barbie dippin', I'm the boss, Barbie sippin'
They keep tellin' me work it, I ain't got no chores
I'm all yours, Barbie kissin', call the stores, Barbie shippin'
Out or indoors, baby, I'ma floss
What? Why of course, Barbie tippin', I endorse, Barbie strippin'
Mink carpet, but I ain't got no flaws
Doors look like wings, Barbie sittin', bada-bing, Barbie trippin'
Curve niggas like they arm in a sling
Hopped off the swing, Barbie swingin', to the ring, Barbie blingin'
Good box, so he called Don King
Who the fuck gon' party with them dollies? No, I never do the mollies
If I hit you, then you probably gon' sue
Who the fuck gon' come through with the body, always lookin' like a hottie
Always sayin' what somebody won't do?
Who the fuck gon’ pull up in your city, lookin' every bit of pretty
With the itty bitty titty bitch crew?
Who the fuck gon' beat him with the .22 if he don't lose the attitude
And run off with his credit cards, too?

It's two girls gettin' more money, and they don't rap, they sing songs
I stay with that pink on, pink furs and them pink thongs
Goons out if they blink wrong, think hard, but don't think long
Pink Friday had Eminem, spit hard but I'm feminine
Iconic trio on Monster, Goblins and Gremlins
What's left that I didn't do? You bit the forbidden fruit
You thought you'd get my spot? Who the fuck was kiddin' you?
Took a lil' break, but I'm back to me
Tryna make a new Nicki, where the factory?
They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill level still just a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I wash bitches take a bath for me
Bunch of trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them giving fake love but that trash is weak
Man, you know that I ripped, every rapper beat
You know Nicki gon' eat, Bon Appétit

Come, come see what I've been up to
Come, come see about me
I know you had a lot of work to do
Ooh, you got used to things without me, baby
Yeah, you got used to every thing I never did
You got sick of being sick of all my flaws
You got over all the pain I ever caused
And I didn't mean it, no, but-

[Pre-Chorus]
They say it's all what you make it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
So please don't try to deny me of that, no
You know my heart couldn't take it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
See, baby, ooh you know I need you to-

[Chorus]
Come, come see about me

Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

I flew in from Trinidad, peep this nigga pressin'
I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'ma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in
None of you bum bitches can't sit with me and Gretchen
It's the biggest, a bitch ain't cough one time, it's the sickest
I don't never clique up, but they know who the clique is
Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest

I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up

Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop ""Another One"", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
""Back to Back""? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery

All come and spoke about your shit in '15

But they don't pay in cash

Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, ""Man, why him?""
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, ""Alright, alright, alright""
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, ""Babe, I think I love you, kinda""

Silence right now sounds so loud
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round
Look at you now, stuck in the background

Used to pull off on me, leave me hur-urt
Tryna front, but I know you do your dir-irt

I did it for everybody out here on their own
I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages
And never tell me no
Come get me when I fall, and tell me when I'm wrong
But you should know I bought 'em
I changed it, I changed it
They say that shit the same, it ain't the same, though
I changed it, I changed it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they on the same shit
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they still on the same shit
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
The big 3 on the court, bitch at them bleachers
I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches
A bitch out in Atlanta eating them peaches
A bitch got more bars than where Big Meech is
No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here
She gon' dread dissin' Nicki like Lisa hair
I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here
The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe
I just be watchin' bitches pitfalls
Stopped doin' pills, but bitch dem withdrawals
I am in my mansion rockin' pink drawers
I leveled up, bitch, I switched flows
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and the bitch is my son
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them bitches I won
This hoe gettin' slick, so I put on gym shoes and extended my run

Different hoes doing the same shit
Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em ""Let's beef""
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Chorus]
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

[Verse 3]
Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, ""We did it""
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin', this is The Pinkprint

You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-Fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-Ring finger where the rock is
The-These hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz

Unless they last name is Cutlet

But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach

We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sittin' down on that big butt
But I was still starin' at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable

Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you

Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga

That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga

For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off

You should say it right now
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, ""This nigga buggin'""
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And, oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Just another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies (Bed)
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine

I came out lookin' to party, and now I'm ownin' that building
You bitches can't get my spot until I start raisin' some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moët
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

What the fuck you smiling for?
And what they put you on the panel for?

And nah man, I ain't fuckin' with that Jean Vest
Playtime been over fuck a recess

Bitches wanna play a game? Go and see Saw
That's one, that's two, and that's three four
I'm hungry, who else could I feast off?
You know my pockets fatter, than that little Vine kid
They couldn't stop me, even if the red sign did
Bitch don't get gassed, like a hybrid
These bitches thinkin' they can do what I did
These bitches thinkin' they can live where I live
But bi-bitches couldn't see me with an eyelid

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Chorus]
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

[Verse 3]
Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, ""We did it""
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint

Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons
Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitchеs where the top is
Ri-ring fingеr where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me

Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you

I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off

Yo, I just wanna be ya rider, you should pull up in that Spyder
You should let me hit the mic, and I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter, let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed, I'm a bad lil' bitch and I never indict her

You ain't never have a bitch understand you, most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to, your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen, when you leave I say, ""Damn, I fucking miss him""
I just wanna be your vixen, give you something real wet to put your lips in

You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters (Matters)
And they say, Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage

You should say it right now

Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

Roll that spaceship, we 'bout to get lifted

This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes, though

Oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, ""This nigga buggin'""
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)

But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mineEmbed"

You bitches can't get my spot until I start raisin' some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moët
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way

But you can't sleep with me

[Verse 1]
Every time I come and fuck with you
You make up all the rules
You ought to do it
Just because our car's moving
Are you in my fucking corner for real?
Or are you plotting to kill?
I tell you just how I feel
But you never hear
Oh, why you take it like that?
Now you wanna leave and never come back
I don't control you, I ain't never say that
Can't give up on you, baby, we go way back

[Chorus]
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me

Nothing ain't ever enough for you
And I had all this hope for you
But all you do is open wounds

And no you ain't them other niggas

Just my real bitches
Why you keep talking about it
You keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Chorus]
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Chorus]
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for

And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)

Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you
[Verse 3]
Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, ""We did it""
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin', this is The Pinkprint

[Verse 1]
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said, ""Let’s see""
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashin' windows and cuttin' them brake lines

I lied, I lied

[Verse 2]
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic (Orgasmic)

[Bridge]
I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from fallin', stallin' the truth
Who knew what you’d do if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I'm not your usual, typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Fallin' so fast, I'm afraid of you
So I lied
[Chorus]
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh, whoa

[Outro]
I lied, ooh, baby

Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three, three words that you're missing?

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where'd you go? Couldn't see, I was too busy
Could've just said no, where would you go? I think I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you gotta use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)

I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm comin' undone

When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-Fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-Ring finger where the rock is
The-These hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-Ma-Mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me

[Verse 2: Drake]
I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sittin' down on that big butt
But I was still starin' at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston, Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doin' makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in somethin', I stand for it
And Nicki, if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it

I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""B"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx actin' like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

One minute they hate me, then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who-who-who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, “She a problem?”
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column?
Who-who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though? You niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas, oh
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh-oh-oh-oh, these bitches got diabetes

But okay, I guess it's my fault

They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back

Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh

I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?

Bi-bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Wa-wa-was in shootouts with the law but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me, Alexander McQueen, he was keepin' me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who-who-who-who wanna go first?, I had 'em pushin' daffodils
I-I-I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill

Roll that spaceship, we 'bout to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes, though

It's okay, we'll take our time

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, ""This nigga buggin'""
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'

But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me

I came out lookin' to party, and now I'm ownin' that building
You bitches can't get my spot until I start raisin' some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moët
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

[Chorus]
Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again

Go against me, then you made a mistake

I sat back and watched how it was playin' out
They diss me, but runnin' and took the same route
Uhn, but no, they not Nicki
Wrist on ice and yes my wrist bricky
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki
Not a website but get money, this is fifty

Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy

Soon as I came in, I told them that I would become the greatest
Muhammad Ali of these bitches, and that can't be debated

All this money I made, all my bitches is laced

Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like, ""What you doin', Nicki?"" Brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Want another round? Well, then get the ref!
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next
When I fly, you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' queen, 'Lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is The Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-send 'em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches

We are going up in flames

They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I'll remain a staple
My career has been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em, ""Think pink""
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh, shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophesy everything I'd do?
But, before I continue, lemme thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and E.I. told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing, I coulda went insane
And even now I think, ""Do I really want this fame?""
Lemme get up and go
Seven hundred to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm startin' the show
Man, I'm birthin' these artists and I'm startin' to show

[Chorus]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom

Ninety-nine percent of them is nobody
Bitches actin' like they killin' shit, okay
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say they copped the soonest
Why these niggas goin' broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them ramen noodles
B-B-B-Bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday at Macy's, thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in there? 'Cause I must've missed it)
Twelve milli to kick my feet up
Get ready, this is the Re-Up

I feel free, I feel freedom

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne)]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through

And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'

You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life

Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in

P-p-p-punch line queen, no boxer though
Might pull up in a Porsche, no Boxster though
Tell a hater, ""Yo, don't you got cocks to blow?""
Tell them Kangaroo Nick, I'll box a ho
They said I got five and a possible
Don't go against Nicki, impossible
I done came through with my wrist on popsicle
Man, these hoes couldn't ball with a testicle, nigga (Ow!)

[Verse 2: Cassie]
Your lipstick stain smells like a cheap hotel
Diamond watches and a gold chain
Can't make my frown turn around

[Pre-Chorus: Cassie, with Nicki Minaj]
The boys always spending all their money on love

You get high, fuck a bunch of girls
And then cry on top of the world

Look, they wanna know why I'm posted at the bar

But really, I don't know why I'm posted at the bar
Ya bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar

She's so pretty, she know they want her, but -
She's so sididdy, they can't afford her,  but -
All the boys stare, when she comes around my way
Straight out the driveway, head to the highway
Red light, green light, got the best moves
Headlights, beam bright, got the best boobs
I call her double R (Range Rover), my rough rider
We hit a couple malls, then the Ramada
Cause on the road of life, she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter, than a coke bottle
She super charge cars, anything for Minaj
And she could only park, in the superstar garage
Cause she-she-she-she bad, if anybody ask
Her bags is boss, cause her leather so soft
And it ain't a bitch softer, tell 'em raise the offer
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch, named Porsche
N-n-now it's me and her, she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louboutin

I used to know this dude, pretty lou' out in LA
Said when I’m in LA, to hit up his cell-ay
Cause he got something nice he wanna put in my belly
He wanna bump and grind sorta like R. Kelly
See money ain’t a thang, 'cause my doe is like woah
Pull out my bank roll on a nigga like ""yo!""
Let’s make some videos, get the Benny Boom crew
I’m hoppin out the Rov in my Jimmy Choo shoe (pick it up, get it up, get it up)
I’m the boss bitch, you know I like to talk shit
I’m heavy in the streets, so you gon’ need a forklift
And, daddy, lemme cum in your mouth like the dentist
I’m not the apprentice, don’t finish your sentence

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, we ain’t gotta talk, we could bone
Soon as we all alone
Then, baby, I’ma get you in the zone
‘Cause you think we’re all the same

I tell ‘em that I’m just singing posters at the bar
But really, Y'all know why I’m posted at the bar
You bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar
I get cake cuz I always got a hustle
I pump weight and I ain’t talkin’ ’bout my muscles
At the club every day but that ho ain’t me
Cuz I be home with the scale like Do Ray Mi

When I step up in the spot that's a wrap

This is for the little girls
That say ""Nicki, you pretty.""
When you come to the city
You don't act hassadiddy
You be all on the block
Or posted up in the drop
And everybody get a band
Whether you like it or not
But how you girls blow up
And don't come to the hood
How they turn their nose up
Like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight
'Til it's time for picture
That's why everything
They write be a contradiction
I tell 'em I do it for the love
I do it for the hugs
I do it for the bugs
I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich
I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid
That can't do no more

Dear Wayne, if this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, there’s some things I should have said to you
First of all, every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man, I really am proud of you
Second of all, I gotta say thanks
You really did alot for my out of state banks
With that being said, let's get down to the real
I still don’t understand what went down with the deal
And I been waiting on you just to give me the word
You know, a couple nouns and a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls that be flippin' the bird
Tryna get up out the hood and get into the ‘burbs
But everything you said, was it just pretend?
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don’t really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings just to wait on you
But what I don’t understand is why you told them you signed me
If you wasn’t ready to get totally behind me
I mean honestly, how could you deny me?
You know you’re Harry and I’ll always be Hermione

[Chorus]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do

Dear Wayne, I'm writing another letter 'cause
You never did respond, it's been a couple months
See when I speak I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing that they gonna hear
But this will be the realest shit that I ever wrote
You see me falling, why you never sent down a rope?
I woulda climbed up, but now my times up
I swear to God man, I thought you had it lined up
But if the Lord had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad with some metaphors?
Knockin' on a set of doors
Knockin' on heaven's doors
Let's play a game, just for pretend
Could we play a game?
Let's act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes, started running to me
And you was running out of breath but you kept going
‘Cause you finally realized what you slept on
If you take your own life are you a sinner?
I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
(If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger)

Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay

Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday

[Verse 1]
You done, you tight? You suck at life?
You don't want a round three? You done suffered twice
Worship the queen and you might could pass
Keep it real, these bitches couldn't wipe my ass
Anyway, stylist, go get Bvlgari
I am the ultimate Svengali
You, you bitches can't even spell that
You, you hoes bugging, repel that
Let me tell you this, sister
I am, I am colder than a blister
'Cause my flow's so sick, and I'm a lunatic
And this can't be cured with no Elixir
'Cause y'all know who the fuck, what the fuck I do
I done put the pressure to every thug I knew
Quack, quack to a duck and a chicken too
Put the hyena in a freakin' zoo

Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Bitches ain't serious, man, these bitches delirious
All these bitches inferiors, I just pimp my interiors
I just pick up and go, might pick up a ho
Might give conversation if you kick up the dough
Never mind my money, never mind my stats
Every bitch wanna be me, you can find 'em in Saks
Pink Friday two milli, ""Super Bass"" triple plat'
When you see me on Ellen, just admit that I'm winnin'
Do a show for Versace, they request me by name
And if they don't get Nicki, it just won't be the same
When I'm sittin' with Anna, I'm really sittin' with Anna
Ain't a metaphor, punchline, I'm really sittin' with Anna
Front row at Oscar de la Renta, posture
Ain't a bitch that could do it, not even my imposter
Put these bitches on lockout, where the fuck is your roster?
I pull up in that new new marinara and pasta

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake my head, yo, I'm mad, ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle o' nowhere, I just feel so alone

7-Up went and gave my commercial to Cee-Lo
But don't tell 'em I said it, let's keep it on the d-low
If you need you a look, just put me on your song
But you know it'll cost about six figures long
But you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets?
Flying Spurs for hers, mean I'm fuckin' above it
And I just got the Ghost and I'm callin' it ""Casper""
But that shit is so cold, it belong in Alaska
Why the fuck am I stylin'? I competes with myself
When you went against Nicki, you depleted your wealth
And I'm not masturbatin', but I'm feelin' myself
Paparazzis is waitin', 'cause them pictures'll sell
Now don't you feel real stupid? Yeah, that's egg on yo' face
If you wasn't so ugly, I'd put my dick in yo' face

Now I'm in the hood, niggas is gettin' woodies

Know that boy busy balling, I like to play all week

Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
B-B-B-Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I guess I went commercial, just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set, though, I ain’t fly commercial
And the ad is global; your ad was local
When we shot it was a lot of different agriculturals
So I laugh at hopefuls; ""Nicki pop!""
Only thing that’s pop is my endorsement, akh
Fuck around and I'll have to go and reinforce the Glock

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
B-B-B-Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, is it me, or did I put these rap bitches on the map again?
You mad ’cause I’m at the Grammys with the Vatican
You in the booth, but I'm who you be channelin’
Why they never bring your name up at the panel, then?
Hottest MCs, top five
You need money? I got mine
More knots than Eric on Basketball Wives
(Ya dig?)

Ugh, I couldn’t do your TV show, I needed ten more mil'
Not ten on the back, I need ten on signin'
Give that shit to a wash-up, bitch, I’m winnin’

Take bitches to school, then I Columbine these hoes

Yes, I really do mean that it’s Barbie, bitch
Ask Mattel, they auctioned my Barbie, bitch
Raggedy Ann, could never be a Barbie, bitch
You at the bottom of the barrel, scrapin’

Eat that pussy, make it numb, she can't feel herself cum
Got a body on my gun, fuck the world with my thumb
Pop a molly, smoke a blunt, that mean I'm a high roller
My ex wanna work it out, bitch, try yoga

This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now
This took dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This that: run and get a dollar for the ice-cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharica
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, ""Money ain't a thang!""
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do: settle
Give me one word for your chain: yellow
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah, I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don’t let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate

What up, Nicki? It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
'Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermedy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan just one year to finish
My list look like this, first thing you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after
Champions

Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy?
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws, you're perfect in my eyes

You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

I get it cracking like a bad back
Bitch talking she the queen when she looking like a lab rat
I'm Angelina, you Jennifer
C'mon, bitch, you see where Brad at?

You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I pull up and I'm stuntin' but I ain't a stuntman
Yes, I'm rockin' Jordans, but I ain't a jumpman
Bitches play the back, 'cause they know I'm the frontman
Put me on a dollar, 'cause I'm who they trust in
Ayo, SB, what the fuck's good?
We ship platinum, them bitches is shippin' wood
Them nappy headed hoes, but my kitchen good
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish a bitch would

Let's shift gears for a minute and talk about New York City. I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesn't rep New York. I say ""What do you mean? She shouts it out all of the time.""

[Nicki Minaj]
Y'all don't want me to rep y'all. Y'all don't hear when I rep y'all cause y'all be dick-riding everybody else.

[Charlamagne]
She does have a point. Do you feel you get the proper love from New York?

[Nicki Minaj]
Hell fucking no.

[Charlamagne]
And I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. You did the DVDs. You did the mixtapes. You came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in New York.

[Nicki Minaj]
I was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking BMW out on Jamaica mutherfucking Avenue to Amadu and Hussaine and these niggas. Fuck you niggas! You niggas don't know the fucking half of what I've fucking been through!

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Honestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
So, Miss Nicki Minaj, what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you're doing things for shock value?

[Nicki Minaj]
Well, I mean, I don't know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that cause another bitch did it.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Stupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.

[Nicki Minaj]
Everybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, they're gonna fucking stone me.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
They're gonna say, ""You're trying to be like Barack's wife. Look at her, she's sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle.""

[Nicki Minaj]
""Why you sitting down and peeing Nicki?""
[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
""Why don't you stand up?""

[Charlemange]
That happens to everybody, though.

[Nicki Minaj]
It does.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
No, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.

[Charlamagne]
I think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely, I always say that. For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison. And I always say, even though it's very common, it's just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time. It is what it is. But even she gets compared to Madonna, and it's a never-ending cycle. But I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to...

[Charlamagne]
Someone that is washed. That's a natural emotion though... It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. That's just the way that it is.
Do you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, ""I did look like a damn fool?""
[Nicki Minaj]
Yes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
[Charlemagne]
Do you ever think that?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Sometimes. Every now and then. You know what I like about superstars? I like my superstars to be out there. Jump out the window! Be like Prince with your ass out. I may see it and say, ""Damn, she looks like a fool,"" but you're a superstar.

That's how I want to see my superstars. I don't want to see my superstars regular.

_________________________________________________________________

[Nicki Minaj]
I keep saying this: I went to school for theater. I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.
I did that because my passion was acting. When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn't really be myself. When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.

I can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. I can now really bring me into it. And I think that's where the confusion lies, is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. But that wasn't. That was a small facet of who I was.

But, who you see now is just a more multi-faceted mixture of all the personalities that I have in me. I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like I do. Cause for every person who doesn't understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what's wrong with that?

[Charlemagne]
You can! Why not?

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space?
[Nicki Minaj]
They already are. They're already existing together, and they are both winning.
[Charlemagne]
Who do you feel that you lean towards more?
[Nicki Minaj]
I can't choose. I can't pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind they're the same person.
That's what I keep saying... I grew up in New York my whole life. I would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend, and then Monday through Friday I was having a nine-to-five on Wall Street.

When I was an office manager I wasn't having the same conversation in the office that I was having on the block, but I was still the same person. I was Onika. But I knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people, get a job, ace the interview, and then go home with my home girls and have fun.

[Charlemagne]
It seems like you're very versatile. If it's one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.

[Nicki Minaj]
Right, because you can't do too much of either. You really can't.

It's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental for your future. It's detrimental for your growth. It's detrimental to your longevity.

At a certain point as a woman -- I'm not talking about as a man because we've seen The Blueprint with Jay. We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 – still win and still be the king of hip hop. We have not seen that with a woman. So, show me the blueprint. That's all I want you to do -- show me the blueprint.

[Charlemagne]
I think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.

[Nicki Minaj]
And is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, ""Okay, wait, hmm, I may not want to be 40 years old rapping. The hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I'm 40 years old rapping. So I'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen."" Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons -- is she a sellout or is she winning?

[Charlemagne]
She's winning!

[Nicki Minaj]
So these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed, and they're living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning? Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? The same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit? Get the fuck out of here!

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
When it's all said and done, are you going to want to have kids? Get married?

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. I'm gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.

And yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, that's the other thing...

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
""Look in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that we'll always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time...""
[Nicki Minaj]
Safaree... Safaree...

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you have any regrets? Cause you've had a relatively short career. This is the second album, and hopefully we can ten more of these. But do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been Nicki Minaj?

[Nicki Minaj]
I think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.

[Charlemange]
How can the author of ""I wish I could enjoy this moment for life"" not be here trying to enjoy every moment?

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely. And that's the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.
[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Pause!

[Nicki Minaj]
And then all of a sudden it's like, ""Wait a minute. I just did Super Bowl. I just did Super Bowl with Madonna. And before I go into the Super Bowl stage I'm just stressing and worrying. And then when I come off it's all done. And what I did I even enjoy about it?

[Charlemagne]
Not even that, you closed up the Grammy's.
[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
But that's why, cause she's doing the Super Bowl, and she's thinking about the Grammy's.
[Nicki Minaj]
And then I'm doing the Grammy's, and I'm thinking about the NBA all-star game. That's the only thing.

I've gotten to a very good place, though. All of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled I used to be. And every time I tell people, ""No, no, I'm really good. I'm really happy. I'm really at a peaceful place."" It's almost like they don't believe me. So I thought the other day, I must have really, really been worried a lot. Because people who know me very well are like, ""Are you sure you're ok?"" But I really am. I've never been this happy. I'm so proud of this album. I'm proud of myself. And I will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential. It's a scare tactic.
_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
What is Nicki Minaj's purpose? Because from the outside looking in, I think you're a very blessed individual. Because you got two things going against you. Number one, you're a female. And the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping. And then you're from New York. There's a lot of rappers from New York that aren't popping right now. So you got those two things going against you.

Being that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are, it's like, ""She's obviously here for something."" I think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know. But what is Nicki Minaj's purpose?

[Nicki Minaj]
I have to pray on that. I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans, really... I've always had this dream of having a Nicki Minaj YMCA type of thing. When I was young -- well, everybody knows my story -- we didn't have a lot. Free lunch was the thing, ""We can get free lunch. Oh, we're going to free lunch. This is like dope!"" So I remember those moments and I always play them back in my head. And I wish to think to myself, I wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that.

But things were moving so quickly. My parents were so, not really stable and just -- my father being an addict and all that. In a lot of ways I feel like I didn't really have a childhood. So when I see kids, it melts my heart because I'm looking at them and I'm like ""They'll never get this moment back again, and they'll always remember this time."" How do we as adults optimize it for them right now, whether they have money or not.

I think that one day I would like to do something for them, for kids in the inner cities, for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling, tutoring. I remember I was really really smart in school, and I think my mother took that for granted. So she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push. But I think that kids need that.

It's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education, but that's real shit. I don't just say that because it sounds good. I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.

I feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. I don't feel like that ever happened. Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, ""Oh well, we're good now, we're out of high school,"" or ""I got my GED, I'm good."" And I don't want my fans to think like that.

I have such a great rapport with my fans. When they see me, they really be bringing out their Bachelor's and their Master's saying, ""Look, Nicki, Look."" Because they know how important it is to me. It's OK to have fun (I'mma give you the raunchiest verse sometimes), but I also want you to realize that it's for a time.

One day, you're going to look back and think ""Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?""

We got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child. But you're having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that. We're the ones in control again. Why are we never in control?

Why are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby? Waiting until you're 35 or 36 to have children?

Technology has changed – you can wait! Have something to offer them. That's something that's dear to my heart, doing something that makes children feel like ""I don't have to rush to grow up. I can enjoy my childhood. I can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes."" That's my bigger goal in life.

[Charlemagne]
How do you stay humble? I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.

I'm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy? Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra...?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
You wanna know what's crazy? Yesterday, remember I was saying to you, ""It's so crazy. She's so famous."" If she goes out, anytime we go somewhere, it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie.

The other day we went to a carnival. We thought we'd be able to be in there, and just go on some rides, and nobody will notice anything. Within like seven minutes the whole park -- it was 10, 15 minutes until we got out.

She really hasn't changed. She really don't act like, ""I'm this person"" or, ""I'm that person."" She just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on. Sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that. It doesn't faze her. She really hasn't changed a bit.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Pay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass?
[Nicki Minaj]
We said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.
[Safaree ""SB"" Samuels]
A butt with lyrics

[Charlemagne]
How did you get out of that?

[Nicki Minaj]
Because I created a brand.

People take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won. It's very hard, mentally, this shit is draining and draining. For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face, and act like this shit ain't getting to you, it's draining.

It's crazy! That's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. When I was coming up, I never understood it. I use to be like, ""What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why don't they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are,"" until you get here and you are like, ""Oh my god! Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this?"" And he's like, ""Yep. Now let's see who really want it."" But, I think I became more than that because people cannot deny... at the end of the day, people can't deny that...

[Charlamagne]
You the shit. Say it! You don't have to be humble. Be like Ray J. ""I'm tired of being humble.""

[Nicki Minaj]
I'm not a cocky person by nature.

[Charlemagne]
Scaff, be cocky for her!

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. You bitches ain't shit, man. You need to just really -- When you see her, get the rose petals, just like she's said before, throw it out in front of her feet. You pour out the champagne. You feed her grapes. If something needs to be sucked, you suck it!

[Nicki Minaj]
What!? What would need to be sucked? On you?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Ay. Anything. Anywhere. I'm in these streets looking for work. We're all in these streets, we're looking for that work, that twerk.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
I just want to tell you, Nicki, I think that you're very necessary. I think you represent something way bigger than hip hop. I think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels. And I think, like how Jay-Z took it to heights and made people be like, ""Damn, hip hop can take you this far!?"" I think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further. So keep doing your thing, Ma.

[Nicki Minaj]
Thank you, darling.

Never mind my money, never mind my stats

When you see me on Ellen, just admit that I'm winnin'
Do a show for Versace, they request me by name
And if they don't get Nicki, it just won't be the same

Ain't a metaphor, punchline, I'm really sittin' with Anna

Ain't a bitch that could do it, not even my imposter

I pull up in that new new marinara and pasta

Jealous niggas is gossip, watch me tie up my laces (Ugh)
Bitches be jocking, tell by the look on they faces
Eight digits I'm clocking, a lot of gold in my bracelet (Woo)
Seven figures on watches; I told my mama I made it (Ha-ha)
Made a deal for my project; just give me ten mil', I'm gravy (Gravy)
I went back to the projects, in two mil of Mercedes
I get head from your lady; have her bill me later
I'm old school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager
Heartbreak hotel, I'm in the A-Rod suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking playoff seats
Know that boy busy balling, I like to play all week

Y'all can have the Poconos (Y'all can have that)
I'm Sonny, and you my son (Calogero)
Ride the whip, five on the hip
Live with the pies, got nine for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick
Oh my, know why? I'm fly as it gets
Now I need a Aspirin; she said, ""You're only Cameron""
Girlfriend, you don't know Cameron from nowhere
So don't go tampering (Watch ya mouth)
You're just a nail, I hammer (Yup!)
'Nother girl that's on my camera (Yup!)
My name, you cannot slander at all
Girl, watch your manners (Yup!)
She run and tell her mother, ""I think I love him, Nana.""
Because you sat upon my lap? Nah! I ain't Santa (Nope!)
They call me ""Pied Piper,"" OJ no glove I knife her

Why would I fight? I don’t even like her

Yo, I guess I went commercial, just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set, though, I ain’t fly commercial
And the ad is global; your ad was local
When we shot it was a lot of different agriculturals
So I laugh at hopefuls; ""Nicki pop!""
Only thing that’s pop is my endorsement, akh
Fuck around and I'll have to go and reinforce the Glock

This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now
This took dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This that: run and get a dollar for the ice-cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharica

Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, ""Money ain't a thang!""
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money

Stay putting on for the town, may I?

Over a mil in three weeks, yeah, I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don’t let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate

What up, Nicki? It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
'Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermedy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan just one year to finish
My list look like this, first thing you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after

From the nice place that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Girl, just sit down, let's talk it out
One-on-one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand, make you laugh again
I need to be near you

Gotta let you know how I'm feelin'
You own my heart and she's just rentin'
Don't turn away, pay attention

'Cause he know that it be a wrap when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck 'cause all them bitches'll catch it
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wait, damn, there I go again

Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant

No ball, but peep game
He addicted to hustle, I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chillin', make a hell of a killin'
Don't I stunt on these bitches?
Man, I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em
When I'm done, I'm a don 'em
When we leavin' the lounge, I'ma keep it a hunnid
It went down, 'nuff said
Pull off in that thang, and it's blush red

We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, 'cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday

I'm insecure
Yeah, I make mistakes
Sometimes, I feel like I'm at the end of the road

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can't handle my worst
You ain't gettin' my best

Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

I used to think that we'd run away
One lovely pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be okay, come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you'll be young forever
I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear, but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you'll be young forever

[Verse 2]
I used to think that we'd reunite
I'd be your wife in the real life
I thought that you'd come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You'd reappear only in my dream

Let's shift gears for a minute and talk about New York City. I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesn't rep New York. I say ""What do you mean? She shouts it out all of the time.""

[Nicki Minaj]
Y'all don't want me to rep y'all. Y'all don't hear when I rep y'all cause y'all be dick-riding everybody else.

[Charlamagne]
She does have a point. Do you feel you get the proper love from New York?

[Nicki Minaj]
Hell fucking no.

[Charlamagne]
And I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. You did the DVDs. You did the mixtapes. You came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in New York.

[Nicki Minaj]
I was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking BMW out on Jamaica mutherfucking Avenue to Amadu and Hussaine and these niggas. Fuck you niggas! You niggas don't know the fucking half of what I've fucking been through!

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Well, Sir Isaac Newton said the law of energy is, ""Energy is not lost or destroyed, it is merely transferred from on party to the next."" You got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you, you read it, and now you're miserable.

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely. Right. Absolutely.

What you think about the blogs, Scaff Beezy?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Honestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
So, Miss Nicki Minaj, what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you're doing things for shock value?

[Nicki Minaj]
Well, I mean, I don't know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that cause another bitch did it.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Stupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.

[Nicki Minaj]
Everybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, they're gonna fucking stone me.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
They're gonna say, ""You're trying to be like Barack's wife. Look at her, she's sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle.""

[Nicki Minaj]
""Why you sitting down and peeing Nicki?""
[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
""Why don't you stand up?""

[Charlemange]
That happens to everybody, though.

[Nicki Minaj]
It does.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
No, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.

[Charlamagne]
I think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely, I always say that. For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison. And I always say, even though it's very common, it's just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time. It is what it is. But even she gets compared to Madonna, and it's a never-ending cycle. But I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to...

[Charlamagne]
Someone that is washed. That's a natural emotion though... It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. That's just the way that it is.
Do you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, ""I did look like a damn fool?""
[Nicki Minaj]
Yes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
[Charlemagne]
Do you ever think that?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Sometimes. Every now and then. You know what I like about superstars? I like my superstars to be out there. Jump out the window! Be like Prince with your ass out. I may see it and say, ""Damn, she looks like a fool,"" but you're a superstar.

That's how I want to see my superstars. I don't want to see my superstars regular.

_________________________________________________________________

[Nicki Minaj]
I keep saying this: I went to school for theater. I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.
I did that because my passion was acting. When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn't really be myself. When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.

I can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. I can now really bring me into it. And I think that's where the confusion lies, is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. But that wasn't. That was a small facet of who I was.

But, who you see now is just a more multi-faceted mixture of all the personalities that I have in me. I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like I do. Cause for every person who doesn't understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what's wrong with that?

[Charlemagne]
You can! Why not?

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space?
[Nicki Minaj]
They already are. They're already existing together, and they are both winning.
[Charlemagne]
Who do you feel that you lean towards more?
[Nicki Minaj]
I can't choose. I can't pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind they're the same person.
That's what I keep saying... I grew up in New York my whole life. I would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend, and then Monday through Friday I was having a nine-to-five on Wall Street.

When I was an office manager I wasn't having the same conversation in the office that I was having on the block, but I was still the same person. I was Onika. But I knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people, get a job, ace the interview, and then go home with my home girls and have fun.

[Charlemagne]
It seems like you're very versatile. If it's one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.

[Nicki Minaj]
Right, because you can't do too much of either. You really can't.

It's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental for your future. It's detrimental for your growth. It's detrimental to your longevity.

At a certain point as a woman -- I'm not talking about as a man because we've seen The Blueprint with Jay. We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 – still win and still be the king of hip hop. We have not seen that with a woman. So, show me the blueprint. That's all I want you to do -- show me the blueprint.

[Charlemagne]
I think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.

[Nicki Minaj]
And is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, ""Okay, wait, hmm, I may not want to be 40 years old rapping. The hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I'm 40 years old rapping. So I'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen."" Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons -- is she a sellout or is she winning?

[Charlemagne]
She's winning!

[Nicki Minaj]
So these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed, and they're living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning? Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? The same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit? Get the fuck out of here!

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
When it's all said and done, are you going to want to have kids? Get married?

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. I'm gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.

And yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, that's the other thing...

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
""Look in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that we'll always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time...""
[Nicki Minaj]
Safaree... Safaree...

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you have any regrets? Cause you've had a relatively short career. This is the second album, and hopefully we can ten more of these. But do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been Nicki Minaj?

[Nicki Minaj]
I think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.

[Charlemange]
How can the author of ""I wish I could enjoy this moment for life"" not be here trying to enjoy every moment?

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely. And that's the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.
[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Pause!

[Nicki Minaj]
And then all of a sudden it's like, ""Wait a minute. I just did Super Bowl. I just did Super Bowl with Madonna. And before I go into the Super Bowl stage I'm just stressing and worrying. And then when I come off it's all done. And what I did I even enjoy about it?

[Charlemagne]
Not even that, you closed up the Grammy's.
[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
But that's why, cause she's doing the Super Bowl, and she's thinking about the Grammy's.
[Nicki Minaj]
And then I'm doing the Grammy's, and I'm thinking about the NBA all-star game. That's the only thing.

I've gotten to a very good place, though. All of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled I used to be. And every time I tell people, ""No, no, I'm really good. I'm really happy. I'm really at a peaceful place."" It's almost like they don't believe me. So I thought the other day, I must have really, really been worried a lot. Because people who know me very well are like, ""Are you sure you're ok?"" But I really am. I've never been this happy. I'm so proud of this album. I'm proud of myself. And I will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential. It's a scare tactic.
_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
What is Nicki Minaj's purpose? Because from the outside looking in, I think you're a very blessed individual. Because you got two things going against you. Number one, you're a female. And the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping. And then you're from New York. There's a lot of rappers from New York that aren't popping right now. So you got those two things going against you.

Being that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are, it's like, ""She's obviously here for something."" I think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know. But what is Nicki Minaj's purpose?

[Nicki Minaj]
I have to pray on that. I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans, really... I've always had this dream of having a Nicki Minaj YMCA type of thing. When I was young -- well, everybody knows my story -- we didn't have a lot. Free lunch was the thing, ""We can get free lunch. Oh, we're going to free lunch. This is like dope!"" So I remember those moments and I always play them back in my head. And I wish to think to myself, I wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that.

But things were moving so quickly. My parents were so, not really stable and just -- my father being an addict and all that. In a lot of ways I feel like I didn't really have a childhood. So when I see kids, it melts my heart because I'm looking at them and I'm like ""They'll never get this moment back again, and they'll always remember this time."" How do we as adults optimize it for them right now, whether they have money or not.

I think that one day I would like to do something for them, for kids in the inner cities, for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling, tutoring. I remember I was really really smart in school, and I think my mother took that for granted. So she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push. But I think that kids need that.

It's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education, but that's real shit. I don't just say that because it sounds good. I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.

I feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. I don't feel like that ever happened. Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, ""Oh well, we're good now, we're out of high school,"" or ""I got my GED, I'm good."" And I don't want my fans to think like that.

I have such a great rapport with my fans. When they see me, they really be bringing out their Bachelor's and their Master's saying, ""Look, Nicki, Look."" Because they know how important it is to me. It's OK to have fun (I'mma give you the raunchiest verse sometimes), but I also want you to realize that it's for a time.

One day, you're going to look back and think ""Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?""

We got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child. But you're having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that. We're the ones in control again. Why are we never in control?

Why are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby? Waiting until you're 35 or 36 to have children?

Technology has changed – you can wait! Have something to offer them. That's something that's dear to my heart, doing something that makes children feel like ""I don't have to rush to grow up. I can enjoy my childhood. I can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes."" That's my bigger goal in life.

[Charlemagne]
How do you stay humble? I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.

I'm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy? Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra...?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
You wanna know what's crazy? Yesterday, remember I was saying to you, ""It's so crazy. She's so famous."" If she goes out, anytime we go somewhere, it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie.

The other day we went to a carnival. We thought we'd be able to be in there, and just go on some rides, and nobody will notice anything. Within like seven minutes the whole park -- it was 10, 15 minutes until we got out.

She really hasn't changed. She really don't act like, ""I'm this person"" or, ""I'm that person."" She just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on. Sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that. It doesn't faze her. She really hasn't changed a bit.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Pay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass?
[Nicki Minaj]
We said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.
[Safaree ""SB"" Samuels]
A butt with lyrics

[Charlemagne]
How did you get out of that?

[Nicki Minaj]
Because I created a brand.

People take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won. It's very hard, mentally, this shit is draining and draining. For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face, and act like this shit ain't getting to you, it's draining.

It's crazy! That's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. When I was coming up, I never understood it. I use to be like, ""What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why don't they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are,"" until you get here and you are like, ""Oh my god! Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this?"" And he's like, ""Yep. Now let's see who really want it."" But, I think I became more than that because people cannot deny... at the end of the day, people can't deny that...

[Charlamagne]
You the shit. Say it! You don't have to be humble. Be like Ray J. ""I'm tired of being humble.""

[Nicki Minaj]
I'm not a cocky person by nature.

[Charlemagne]
Scaff, be cocky for her!

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. You bitches ain't shit, man. You need to just really -- When you see her, get the rose petals, just like she's said before, throw it out in front of her feet. You pour out the champagne. You feed her grapes. If something needs to be sucked, you suck it!

[Nicki Minaj]
What!? What would need to be sucked? On you?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Ay. Anything. Anywhere. I'm in these streets looking for work. We're all in these streets, we're looking for that work, that twerk.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
I just want to tell you, Nicki, I think that you're very necessary. I think you represent something way bigger than hip hop. I think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels. And I think, like how Jay-Z took it to heights and made people be like, ""Damn, hip hop can take you this far!?"" I think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further. So keep doing your thing, Ma.

[Nicki Minaj]
Thank you, darling.

It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's, ""Which world tour should I go on today?""
See, you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money, yeah, I'm Universal

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best

I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches, I could see your halo

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?

I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma
""Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,"" asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

[Verse 4: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad

What's going on? They'll lock you away

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse

Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can

Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy

I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
St-st-step up in the party like my name was ""That Bitch""
All these haters mad because I'm so established
They know I'm a beast, yeah, I'm a fuckin' savage
Haters, you could kill yourself (Ah)
In my space shuttle and I'm not comin' down
I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes, it's just me and all my bottles all alone
I ain't comin' back this time

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am & Nicki Minaj]

You was heckling me, now it's monotony winning regularly, yo

Bitches ain't got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract was signed, but I am the addendum
So-so where my dawgs at, Randy

'Ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi

I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal

Hope you can take the heat like LeBron

This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
'Rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire
Where we flyin', they can't find us, all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it, uh

I'ma grab your waist, then I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it, then I'ma blaze it

And she let him back in, and he just did it again

I'm blazin', I'm flagrant, I'm crazy, I'm sayin'
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is her fave, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just perf, uh, Prada colored beige
It's obvi we the ish and I'm rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff'
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag lookin' magnif'
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas, I was tryna ad-lib

Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear, sometimes, it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percoce's
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around, I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe (I am)
Then you say I won't survive if I leave (Who I am)
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve (Ah)
I no longer need your attention, at ease

Mmm, oh
Mmm
Yo

[Verse 1]
Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you

I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, I tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media

I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I could just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol, but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this
My flow's a crisis, they screamin' high pitch
Uh, gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes
Headed to the top, dot org

We was just chillin' up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call
That's the effect they call a snowball
Next thing you know, I was runnin' down the hall
Sayin', ""Please come back, I have given my all""

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'ma need sixty-nine real bad girls for my tour bus
Somebody get security to escort us
They go the long way, but we take the short cuts
Give me the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts
You know the flow sick, came in on the small bus
So give the D-cup, C-cup, small bust
They judge me like the girl's on trial
But every time that I come out, it's just girls gone wild
Got the domino effect, in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call 'em cashews
Every other city, it's another Nicki tattoo
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You know the real bitches love me, fuck the fake girls
So if you pretty, I sign titties
I got the key to every muhfuckin' city (Kyuh)

Okay, so when I'm in the hills, I hang with Kristin Cavallari
And when I'm in Miami, I'm with Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe
And when I'm in the A, I'm with Ciara or it's Keri
I'm feeling like a diva, then I hit Mariah Carey
I'm in the UK, I'ma see M.I.A
Superhero by night, r-r-rapper by day
And if I just wanna talk, I'ma hit up Monique
If I need a bad bitch, Angelina Jolie (Ooh)
Material girls like Madonna, model for Donatella
Ain't nothing you can tell her 'cause she get the mozzarella
She look just like Rihanna
She work with Wilhelmina, only rocking Galliano
She might be Filipino, be sipping Pellegrino
Be watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo
Anyway, yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said Strangé
I'm out in Paris, motherfucker, with Beyoncé

Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case

She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 1]
It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's, ""Which world tour should I go on today?""
See, you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money, yeah, I'm Universal

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?

Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches, I could see your halo

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

Roman, Roman, stop it, stop it
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
You and this boy Slim Shady
What's going on? They'll lock you away
They'll put you in a jail cell, I promise
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed, run along, let's go, come on

A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em
If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em (Pss)
Let me shake it off
I just signed a couple deals, I might break you off
And we ain't making up, I don't need a mediator
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse

Pickin' up dishes, throwin' 'em at you

And I start cryin' and I start screamin'

Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can

You could turn a free throw to a goal

How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B in the league
Yeah, inevitably, but could it be little me?
You was heckling me, now it's monotony winning regularly, yo
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract was signed, but I am the addendum
So-so where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick, bitch, Andy
'Ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'm the best now
Anybody with some money should invest now

This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
'Rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire
Where we flyin', they can't find us, all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it, uh
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'ma grab your waist, then I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it, then I'ma blaze it

Yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in, and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end
I'm blazin', I'm flagrant, I'm crazy, I'm sayin'
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is her fave, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just perf, uh, Prada colored beige
It's obvi we the ish and I'm rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff'
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag lookin' magnif'
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas, I was tryna ad-lib

Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear, sometimes, it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percoce's
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around, I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe (I am)
Then you say I won't survive if I leave (Who I am)
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve (Ah)
I no longer need your attention, at ease

Mmm, oh
Mmm
Yo

[Verse 1]
Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, I tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

So give the D-cup, C-cup, small bust

But every time that I come out, it's just girls gone wild
Got the domino effect, in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call 'em cashews

Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You know the real bitches love me, fuck the fake girls

So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it—""has-been""
Hang it up: flatscreen, ha
Plasma
""Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,"" asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars: sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho: punt
Force trauma: blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block

Raah, I eat your face off

I love Nicki's curves, swing at the baseball
ERRR! I'll beat your brakes off
Hi, I'm Tune, salt in the wound
I'm up in this bitch, pardon the goons
Throw dirt on the floor and get caught in the broom
I like a big, wet pussy with a fork and a spoon
I got money and the power, a woman in the shower
And she don't want nothing but my Johnson—Howard
Sour Dies' in the Swisher Sweet, sweet and sour
You're scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible
Ah, I don't know what y'all on
Please, I go in like ""Goin'""
Dr—Drink in my hand with the world in the other
The Uzi go ""Brrrr-r-r-r-r"": stutter, ha
Life is a puzzle, jigsaw
All I do is win, my name should be ""Victor""
Haha! Old-ass rappers
I'm still the shit: old-ass Pampers
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Foie gras, I hear you ducks is quackin'
I was just pluckin my ashes, I'ma puff it and pass it
I'm a fuckin' assassin, you should jump in the casket
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now, I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""N—N—Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
W—W—Word? That bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I—I—I—I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill: mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss: overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom! Motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck: overbite

And he keep a do-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
""S"" on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me ""mama, lil' mama,"" I call him ""baby""

Uh huh, yo yo I need all the dudes in the club
Get ya money out
(Let's get 'em Keri)
Stop, now let me see your booty drop

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
If you think you impressin' us with your ice and your dub
Poppin' bottles in the club, get your money up (Uh-huh)
'Cause I ain't your average girl, I've been all around the world
With your boy, wanna wow me?
Then get your money up
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
I wanna see something bigger than a Hummer truck
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You gotta throw something bigger than a hundred bucks

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Now slide slide one of them black cards
If you got it, then show me how you're gettin' it
Diamonds a girl's best friend, if you can provide them
Might even act a fool while you're hittin' it
When you see me in my thang, blow a whole lot of change
Let the bottle get jealous, get your money up
And if you don't like us, there's nothing to discuss
We don't even give a fuck, get your money up

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole & Polo Da Don]
If you're tearin' the bar down with all the fly women
And still livin' with your momma
Get your money up
If you ridin' big whips, can't take care of your kids
Why you lookin' at me?
Get your money up
When I'm up in the club, you know how we roll
Them bottles pop, nonstop
You up in Hollywood, you know how we roll, stop!
Now let me see your booty drop

[Breakdown: Keri Hilson]
Catchin' what I'm talkin' about, I don't wanna hear your mouth
You needa put some money down, or get your money up
Why you invadin' my space? Why you get up in my face?
I ain't got nothing to say, but get your money up
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You know I wanna see something better than the autobus
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You know my bottle cost more than a hundred bucks
[Chorus: Keri Hilson & (Polo Da Don)]
Get your money up

Get you some big money and don't forget about me when you're spendin' it
But if you ain't gon' pay, don't be screamin' out, ""Hey girl""
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo yo yo yo
Big meals. I think I'm gettin the 'itis

Three girl play, so I'm tripling my value
Keri steal, Keyshia pass, Nicki with the alley oop
More bottles then a wine-o
Then with a coupe, all-white albino
And you know it's going down, like draino
Cause when I come out, it's a zoo with a rhino
Ok, he know he's gonna have to step up on a C-note
Starbucks Hazelnut Vanilla Cappucino
Rose, Greeco

Get your Brinks truck, I'm flyer than Darkwing Duck
[Chorus: Keri Hilson & (Polo Da Don)]

But I know two are the same
Call it ""murdered"" and ""married""

But ain't no love, like a calendar with no Februaries

Like your third infection, I hope you learned your lesson
Yeah, I spit raw, but I prefer protection
I own a heart and a mind and a shirt she slept in
Bitch, I got the answer, and still ain't heard the question
I shut your club down, please reserve my section
Fuck a confrontation, there ain't no cake in it
And I'm caking, bitch, so tell me why I'd take a break from it
The mother of your child always tell you I'm her favorite
She call me her baby
Not the one she was in labor with
She say, ""Ooh, you taste good,"" I say, ""Ooh, just savor it""
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit

Counting a quarter million while I'm pouring a bowl of cereal
Fresher than your ever were, richer than a year ago
With three dollars a skittle but it's eight hundred a cheerio
I was arrogant, Muls' same color as a prune
Yellow chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon
Room, hear it ert-ert when it skrt

You can chirp, I got twerk, I keep work in my birds

I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts
Got the Halloween kicks trick or treating the clutch
Come on nigga, is you tricking or what?
Flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white tee, some boobs and bamboo
White girls tell me, ""Hey, Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?""
Asalaamalaikum, no oink for me
And I never let a D-boy boink for free
Cause it's barbie bitch, you can join the wave
I done penny, nickel, dimed, I done coined the phrase
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Leer
Indian-style court side with a cavalier
VIP Roseau's you can have a beer
Cause honey when you getting money you don't have a care

Now Roger that, Rroger that. Roger that, Rroger that
Roger that, Roger that...Roger

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Young black Rico's
Kill for the C notes
But me though
I jack son bitch Tito
She wanna play games
But this is not bingo
Monopoly I'm past ""GO""
Gon' ahead and deep-throat
4-chick Foursomes
Skin colors mocha
Sally and Sonia put the pussies on my Totem
Pole
Watt stroke 'em
Strike it like bowling
Now open like you yawnin'
It's 6 in the morning
Sleeping on me probably in a coffin
I'm hotter than the end of fuckin' August
I'm awesome
I'm awesome. Repeat it to your Grandma and Uncles, my Mothers
Tyga's no Dad but I'm the motherfucker
My fuckers
This the last supper
Look, no hands
I'm a bread cuffer
I don't dare lover
I'm a dare devil
I don't fear nothin'
Motherfucker

She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless

So I closed it, where your clothes is?

It's going down, down Barbie, pushing a pink Ferrari
I race through Africa just to see the safari
I am the baddest bitch in America
Slicker than a Jheri curl, just ask Erykah
The black Sarah Jessica, J-J-Jessica!
Don't be text messaging me, I never check my messages
Only thing you could ask me is how I want my sandwiches
I want more cheese, lots and lots of cheese
And when I'm on the stage I'm with SB
And when you see my luggage it says LV
And when I'm on the plane it's so empty
Hmmm, that's why all those female rappers envy

[Hook/Outro (Spoken)]
Oh, I'm sorry. Did she say something? My bad

More head than a dread, my youte

I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
I mean, you know
It's like when I feel really crazy
I just get my broom and fly away
I go real, real far away
Young Money
That's-that's-that's just what we do
You know, I mean we-we wear straightjackets
And we-we-we-we stay in, you know, padded rooms
And, you know, and we fly away

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I just came out of the motherfuckin' old school
Got my Mac Notebook with the Pro Tools
You bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad woof woof, flyer than a Frisbee
So I'm up in Mandalay, eating mangos
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star, they singing the “Star Spangled
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-banner,” and I, I am the rap Hannah
Mo-Mon-Montana, so fix your antenna
I keep three hoes, but don't call me Santa
A-And I’m, and I’m flyer then reindeers in the winter

So I got a bad-bitch mentality
'Cause I just came from another galaxy
I be with the president up in the White House
If we in the Oval Office, then the lights out
'Cause I am the Wicked Witch, I'm the Nickster
And I keep a bad bitch on my GSX-R
But I leave her in a second for a thicker
Rockstar little mama with a guitar
I mean, I'm Nicki L-M-N-O-winsky
I mean, my name ring bells like Tinky
I mean Tinker, tell that nigga link her
'Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, thinker
Thinker... Thinker

[Chorus: Bianca Bonnie]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy

Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straightjacket crooked, I hear you lookin
I promise I'm hard and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes, I am
Right up in the cuckoo nest I land
I'm fly, now eat my bird shit
Yeah, I'm crazy, crazy 'bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm lookin' for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, the superb witch
And Weezy F Baby, no, Weezy F Crazy

When I do it, it gets done, 2 sticks in my bun
Pull up in a 6, hun, you was fixing to run, hoe

Ninas on the side of em, goonies on the side of em
Anybody get it boy be careful on the side of them

Money hungry honey with me when they holla she gonna carry you
Flyer than a aerial, vehicle, gerital
Sitting on my feet when I'm stuntin on them people
I tell no fables everything tailored
Fax machines, Office Max, see me for that paper
You working with short bread, ain't my money long youngin'
Bitch I'm bout trappin, more digits than a phone number
Different time zones on em, kill them niggas lyrically
Left side of my closet, look invaded by Italy
Right side Paris, left side flagging, paper is my main chick, me and money married
And that's all a nigga know bitch, that's why these brand new niggas on my old shit

My money is smear and smothered your money you hear me brother
Been about that bread like I was broke or still in the gutter
And in case you ain't know there will be no replacement
And them bags of Arab Money I got stashed in the basement
Face it, whenever I shine, I glisten, and whenever I talk, you listen
Ain't no money getting made in these streets without my permission
I keeps it drug-infested, my money is well connected
It's to the point my conglomerate is well-respected
You need to check my method
I promise you I be the wrong nigga when it comes to my money that you ever want to mess with
Grind like missionary labor, holding dignitary paper
You already know my team is filled with consiglieres, we made you
I don't give a fuck about your stipulation
Type of bread appropriate for every situation
You can tell by the jewelry sitting on my collar
From the bread to the crib, I know all about the dollar5Embed"

Long as I'mma keep buying designer she's a rider
Scooped her out of that Nissan, threw her in a Hummer truck
Four wheel drive when you ride, you ain't never stuck
Who is he? Could it be? Young Joey, he gotta be
Honestly the hottest 'cause when you shop there ain't no stoppin' me
I ain't seen no black cards, all I know is push 'em in
Prada gotta block, 100ft cops tryna scuff my Timbalands
Goddamn, I love them haters, stepping on my Maury kids
Me muggin' a Gucci truck, sorta like a [?]

My name ring bells, bitch, buzz me in (Bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy in the trunk or in the Lamby (Ohh)
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good-uh

I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' L.A. Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)
These birds all fly south in the winter (Uh)
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner? (C'yeah)
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hahahahahaha, no muzzle (What you gonna do, do, do?)

Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner (Dinner)
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelie-in' them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees (Ackees)
Kisses to my fans unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky (Cocky)

But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'
They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'
Your girlfriend, her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money dungeon, bitch, my swagger just punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun ""Gunović""

But, but first of all, when I say ""two sticks in my bun""
I mean that, when I put a bun in my hair
Like, when I put my hair in a ponytail and I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
'Cause y'all, y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?
But Holiday, you already know, y'knahmsayin?
They heard that hard spittin', they heard that fast shit
Now, you know, you gotta slow it down for them, you know?
Um, they wanna hear me sing
You know, behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly girl
There's a really sweet Harajuku Barbie, and, um
Now it's time for them to hear me get all nice and soft and moist
I mean, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that
I meant, this is the portion of the tape where

Then you can bring out all them cars that they rap about
Then I'ma let you eat it, like I put the snacks out
Don't say you can't, say you can, say you can, can
Flip that money, flip it like a handstand

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Do a handstand, could you do a handstand?
Flip that money, make it do a handstand
I can make 'em scream, like a Summer Jam band
Where are my bands, where my Rubber Band Mans?

Tryna show me I'm his number one investment
He know what I like, stay on your job type

Aphilliates!

[Verse 1]
Hear the Devil callin', I can hear 'em
It's like, I get chills down my spine, when I'm near him
Man, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him
I don't need the preachers, I'm the high priestess (Kyuh, kyuh)
Everywhere I go, I get ""Hi, nice to meet you""
Bitches know I beast this, I'm the fashionistis
And they know, I stay around the white, like a groom (Huh)
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom (Woah, oh)
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high, on my own supply (Uh-huh)
Yellin' ""Rastafari! "" when I'm ridin' by
See, I used to be the wife, of a king (Yeah)
Back when I was smugglin' them things, in the bing (Holiday Season!)
Now that I'm a boss bitch, it's a win-win (Uh-huh)
Come to Mr. Chow's, or meet me in Chin-Chin (Okay)
Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring - (What up?)
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding! (Kyuh, kyuh)

[Chorus]
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties

[Verse]
I'm a dime, you a nickel-ette, light skinned-ed pigment
Write my own shit, y'all copyrighting infringement
I eat these rap bitches, somebody get me a dinner mint
Pussy make him tattoo my name upon his ligament
Fuck wrong with them, my nerves they keep tweaking'
Tell them I'm the chief, I'm runnin' with Mohikans
Tell them this is church, and tell them I am the deacon
Tell them that I'm Black, Chinese, and Butter Pecan
Pull up in the Range, I'm givin' them more reasons
Hit up Lil Wayne, while I'm in the 4 Seasons
Tell Gudda, Mack, and Kidd Kidd I'm here
I'm colder than a cough, I'm wetter than swimwear
Got all these little bitches, g-gettin' p-pink hair
I'm pretty and I'm fly, I'm up in the pink Lear
I needed an assistant, I got me a pink queer
Decorated his office, with flowers and pink chairs (C'yeah)

Dammit it's a miracle, please adjust the temperature

Damn Gucci lyrical, nah I ain't lyrical but my bracelet is crazy but my necklace is a miracle
Blacker than Nigeria, with brand new material
Counting a quarter million while I'm pouring a bowl of cereal
Fresher than your ever were, richer than a year ago
With three dollars a skittle but it's eight hundred a cheerio
I was arrogant, Muls' same color as a prune
Yellow chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon
Room, hear it ert-ert when it skrt
26's on the skirt's and a bird with a flirt
You can chirp, I got twerk, I keep work in my birds
I got bird, I got brickss, I got pounds of that herbs

Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me? (Oh)
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for

Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty (Sw-sw-sw-swinging for)
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me? (Sw-sw-sw-swinging for)

[Verse 2]
Yo, why did you envy? Why you go against me?
When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me?
Why, when I needed it, why you couldn't lend me?
Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
'Cause now I see-see-see-see, all your run-down
Niggas better have my money by sundown (Trap-A-Holics mixtapes)
'Cause now when I come through, I'm stylin' on 'em
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos, did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump, if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up, in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when that bell go ""Ding!""
[Chorus]
Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me? (Oh)
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for

Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me? (Sw-sw-sw-swinging for)
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty (Sw-sw-sw-swinging for)
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me? (Sw-sw-sw-swinging for)
(Yo, it's Aphilliates, nigga, pay attention)

[Bridge]
I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me?
'Cause you thought that I would die, but I'm fine
I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me-e-e-e-e?
'Cause you thought that I would die, but I'm fine
(Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine)
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

(Traduzione Italiana)Can Anybody Hear Me? Lyrics[Intro]
Pay attention
If you move, I'll fall
(Davaughn on the beat)
I'm leanin on you, you baby, you baby
Trap-A-Holics

[Verse]
Yo, yo, I push, p-p-push it, I push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me to love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
(Holiday Season!)
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nick of time it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroine
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
(I'm so Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn)
Yo, write it down, take a picture, bitches, e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap (Female Rap)
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade, then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty-nose hood rat
""I love Nicki"" scribbled all over you book bag (Book bag)
I love you too (Love you too)
I just wish your mother would've hugged you too (Hugged you too)
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road, lookin' for the Wiz (For the Wiz)
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D (They got A.D.D)
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school (Ready for school)
See Nicki Minaj LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like[Spoken Interlude]
Yeah, follow the rules
Let me say my prayers and get ready for school
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it)
(Please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
She said, ""Fuck Fendi"", but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim, her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality, she Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch, fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj, she a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Curren$y
But every time she do a interview, you know I run and see (Trap-A-Holics, Holiday Season!)
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me

Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
'Cause every time a door open for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers and statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
'Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetings (Kyuh)
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris
Lighty, when you're done, just salute a bad bitch (Kyuh)
Only underground bitch around that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swervin' the Maseratsi
Stay around the white like a Nazi

[Verse 2: Ron Browz]
I just signed the deal so everything is all good
Made a mood and get my niggas out the hood
Same place where Murda Mace once stood
Ferrari cars, interior all wood
Now I'm in the club, bottles on me
Louis Vuitton fits on me
Heavy chains, nothin' hollow on me
I'm a star now, all the problems on me
Shawty lookin' nice so I'm lovin' her

She's got wings, see her float by
Whole crew sick, hottest things out
Street fitted in bring 'em out, bring 'em out
L.V. on the shoulder
She look right in the Rover
In the club, never sober
Ballers, we the niggas on the posters
Rockstar, so Sunny Bono
Cowboy, so Tony Romo
Shake down shawty, that's the logo
Feel free, fuck the po-po

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Hopped off the boat, I am such an immigrant
Why he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament?
Wait, just for the record, get wetter than fishermen
Pull up with some 26s up under the Michelins
You know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol
That's why I keep my wrist looking like like a disco
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy
Mommy, you bad, but Nicki is badder
Step your cookies up, go get you a ladder
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel
I feel freer than the slaves on the railroad
[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
You think I'm lying
I feel like I'm flying
I feel like I'm finally free
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free

And he lookin' for a bad bitch for his squadron
That's how we got together, see he control the weather

Yo, why the fuck these lil' bitches always talkin' shit about what they did and–
I don't give a fuck, bitch
Nicki Lewinsky, look (Fucker)

[Verse 1]
When you was on stage with your brain on drugs
""Nick-Nack, Carry Crack,"" what my nickname was
And when you was in the hood with bottles of OE
I was OT, lookin' real lowkey
I do a strip tease if the cops stop me
A pair of Guess jeans, and some beef and broccoli
I was at the Rucker, I was sippin' on a Smucker's (Oh)
I was rockin' hats that was made for the truckers (Let's go)
That's when I hopped out the pink on pink
Hate it when a bitch act like her shit don't stink
See you was drippin' wet, you was jumpin' in the crowd
I was in a jet, I was swervin' through a cloud (Oh)

[Bridge]
You know, I-I'ma put them bitches in a time machine and, and, and
And send 'em back to the past and shit
Bitches always talkin' 'bout shit they did and all that
Bitch, get in a time machine

When they was hot, when they was tourin' with the OJ's
I tell a bitch this, ""I'm not impressed, bitch""
I'm Nicki M, trick, I'm always on the guest list
I'm on my way to Riker's Island with a couple hard
I'm on a bike, nine-five-four double R
And they don't write shit, they might write a couple bars
That's why they gettin' drop-dropped, like a couple cars
(You shouldn't have said that)
NY to NO
Late night shows, like Letterman and Leno
End, where you cut it, home-slice, your gar-bage
White boys tell me that I rock, like guitars

[Outro]
See, see, you see Anna Mae?
I'm 'bout to slap y'all bitches around and call y'all Anna Mae
Like, that, that's what y'all gon' get in a minute, re-real talk, like
'Cause, you know, this is '08 now, like
So, anything you talk about, like, it gotta be
It gotta be at least within a, a two year radius type shit, like

Take off a shoe, slap a bitch with the back of the pump (Kyuh)
I ain't never had a problem givin' bitches the business
Pop bitches in the eye like I finished my spinach (Kyuh)
I'm a New York broad, spend chips in the village
Hopped out the yellow cab, oops, the yellow Jaguar
Girls don't like me, guess it's the swagger
Don't talk to me 'bout, chicks got skills (No)
She's alright, but she's not real
Listen big homie, I'm that deal

Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions!
'Cause we pack shows, Celtics like Boston
You see me in the lobby, takin' pics and flossin'
After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am runnin' this shit, I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches, but approach with caution
You be talkin' slick, and honestly I could see why
You don't know me and I ain't talkin' 'bout T.I
Just when they thought I was done for the winter, I
Came out stuntin', I'm such a big spender, I
Two of everything but nope I'm not a Gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game
'Cause you know I only fuck wit' ballers
Yup, them is my type of niggas, shotcallers
I been around the world, I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin Power flow, I'm groovy bitches
And no, you're no match for my Uzi bitches

Some live for the bill, some kill for the bill
She whine for the bill, grind for the bill (And she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill (And she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill, oh

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
High school, she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym (Just to get a peek again, she's a ten)
High school she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym (Just to get a peek again, she's a ten)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (Where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (Where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (Where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed
Go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (Where my money at?)
She ended up in the wrong car
Bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (Where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (Where my money at?)

[Chorus: Akon]
See I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (Dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (Dollar, dollar bill y'all)
See I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (Dollar, dollar bill y'all)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj & Wyclef Jean]
But when a good girl gone, she gone forever
See, you can't make it rain without the stormy weather
And it's funny when it rains, when it rains it pours
Would've never happened if I would've stayed indoors
Would've never happened if I never traded in my textbooks
'Cause now I'm hot but the critics say I'm just looks
They say I'm too sexy, they say I'm sellin' out
'Cause when I come out niggas get their umbrellas out
I take the L 'cause I don't want to see my brother lose
Been through it all but I can never fill my mother's shoes
And now, I don't want a handout
I just want my ad-libs to get panned out
And I just wanna tell the girls that could feel me
That I just play the cards that a nigga deal me
See, everything I been through coulda killed me
That's why there really ain't nothing you could tell me
You see, I live for the bill, I die for the bill
And I still make sure I read the bi– to the –ble
And every time I write I'm precise in my skill
It's more to life than just ice in your grill
Fuck me, blame me, fuck you, pay me
This is what you made me (Where my money at?)
Say you want to drape me, turned around and rape me
Now you ain't mistake me (Where my money at?)
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Where my girls at? Where my girls at?
If they frontin' then tell 'em, ""Yo, where my money at?""
Where my money at?
Where my, where my money at?

Ya girl been hot since Corduroys
Since quarter waters, and all the boys used to
Try to beat like the corner boys
'Cause they heard the pussy wetter, than them Dorney rides
Fuck with who? Fucks with you
As long as them checks clear like Huxtable
I’m known to hang wit' a thug or two
Niggas that only do, what a thug would do
Ask about me, the FEDs watch daily
Gettin' more cheese, more bread than a deli (Alright)
And I’m gettin' love, fan mail like Melly
And I throw it up, twelve o'clock when I wheelie
I’m in the A, I scoop my nigga J'
Coupe gotta be grey, you gotta get paid
Ain’t nothin' worse, than being a broke bitch
I always got crack, I tell 'em to smoke this

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, ya boy been nice since thunder cats
Since leather boomers and lumber jacks
Come outside with a hundred stack
Jeans with the sweat pants under that, yeah
Front on who? Not on me (Never)
Niggas know I keep the seventeen shot on me (Yep)
Made a lil' something off rap, lot off D (Haha)
Get your points off another nigga, not off me (Uh-uh)
Air forces, new trues and a crispy tee
New coupe, nigga, CL-63
Cost you nothin', we get hit for free (Nothin')

I'm also known as baby girl in the coupe
Never get me confused with baby girl in the hoop
'Cause Nicki stay fly like that Cash Money dude
I'm stuntin' on these hoes like Marilyn Monroe
I got a S-curl flow, I spit slick, ya know?
And I don't just spit raps, and chit-chat
Nicki could get it in, Nicki could spit gats
Ya girl got hustle, Nicki could pitch crack
But Nicki rather chill and stack a mil'
While these hoes stay in hoods like rats for real
My voice stay on the track like a Mac for real
Riding the baseline like 'Quille O'Neal
Gassed ya baby father for the keys to the Escalade
Not a baby momma but I'm drama like Kay Slate
What can I say? That's how ya girl do
Ya girl stay fresh down to the cuticles
My people smoke dutches, we don't fluck with bamboo
I'm a winner mami, ya career's a gamble
Old ass broad, off track, like bad weaves
Nicki stay on her toes, on point, like ballerines
Let me remind you, I'm gettin' a tan, too
Ya caramel dream, ya girl from Queens
They say I'm too pretty to be spittin' sixteen
I should be on the screen, posin' for Maybelline
Or be a Baby Phat girl, kitten on my jean
Hood star broad, Black Barbie Doll
Pardon me if the cockiness botherin' y'all
I'm just bein' Nicki Minaj, ya know?
Girl from around way, without the L Cool J
Ma' you spit Kool-Aid, I spit acid out
Doin' this since you was Reebok, Classic Doubt
Now this ho wanna get at Nic', why?
'Cause I bagged her baby daddy, she ain't seen him since

This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Shawn Wright]
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try)
(Can you hear me? Yeah) C'mon

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Daddy was a crack fiend
Two in the mornin', had us runnin' down the block like a track team
When you burnt the house down and my mother was in it
How could I forget it? The pain is infinite
She's my Queen and I ain't even British
She's the only reason that I went to school and I finished (Kyuh)
She told me that I had talent
Got on her knees, and prayed for me when I started bein' violent (Okay)
She saw somethin' in me that 'til this day I don't know if I could be that (Kyuh)
But I'ma die tryin' and when I'm done cryin'
Grab the iron and black out like I'm retirin' (Kyuh)
Nightmares of you killin' my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
And they should've thrown a book at you
'Cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Shawn Wright]
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic (I'll keep tryin')
My voice projected, my life reflected (Keep, keepin' on)
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try)

Damn, I wanna run to you
Hold you and kiss you, and tell you how I miss you (I miss you, baby)
Thought I would have a son for you
But now it's official, it's over and I can't let you go (Ooh)
But I gotta let you know
All the shit I did made me feel like I'm dyin' real slow
'Cause no one understands me
They don't know what to do when I'm hurt and when I'm angry (Kyuh)
You was my friend, and my man, and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything I ever needed, knew you had me
'Cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you? That's the question
It took this long for me to learn my lesson
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
Finally understand the true meanin' of karma

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Shawn Wright]
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic (I'll keep tryin')
My voice projected, my life reflected (Keep, keepin' on)
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Please baby, forgive me (Forgive me)
Mommy was young, mommy was too busy tryna have fun
Now, I don't pat myself on the back for sendin' you back
'Cause God knows I was better than that (Kyuh)
To conceive you, then leave you
The concept alone seems evil, I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhered to the nonsense
Listened to people who told me I wasn't ready for you
But how the **** would they know what I was ready to do?
And of course, it wasn't your fault (No)
It's like I feel you the air
I hear you sayin', ""Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here?"" (Yes)
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleepin', I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand
If it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again
[Bridge: Shawn Wright & Nicki Minaj]
The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on, gotta keep on)
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on (Keep on)
My voice projected, my life reflected
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic (More, more, more, more, more, gotta keep, mo–, more)
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on

May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
