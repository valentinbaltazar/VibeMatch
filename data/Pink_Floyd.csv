Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour and Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every day is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spellsSee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

Don't be afraid to care
Leave, but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire

Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spellsEmbed"

It'd be interesting to see exactly what four people could do if just given the equipment and didn't know anything about it, really
And just told them to get on with it, and do something
Be an interesting experiment
I think we'd come off better
It's like saying give a man an Esquire guitar and he becomes Eric Clapton

I know it's not true and give a man an amplifier and a synthesizer

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Bridge]
Oooo-aaaah, oooo-aaaah
Ooooh, ooooh, oh wah

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time (Oooo-aaaah, aaa-haaa)
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines (Oooo-aaaah, oh woa-ho)
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way (Ooooh)
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say (Oooo-aaaah)See Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right, without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that whеn they turn their backs on you
You’ll get thе chance to put the knife in

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you lose control, you’ll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

[Interlude: 08:03 – 12:15]

[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Got to admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer

[Instrumental: 13:26 – 15:19]

[Verse 5: Roger Waters]
Who was born in a house full of pain?
Who was trained not to spit in the fan?
Who was told what to do by the man?
Who was broken by trained personnel?
Who was fitted with collar and chain?
Who was given a pat on the back?
Who was breaking away from the pack?
Who was only a stranger at home?
Who was ground down in the end?
Who was found dead on the phone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?

On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry
For freedom had arrived
And on the day the wall came down
The ship of fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night
Paper doves in flight

[Chorus 1]
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I couldn't do a thing for you

[Verse 2]
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there's a change that evеn with regret
Cannot be undonе
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey

[Chorus 2]
I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residue slipped away
Slipped awaySee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone as my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

Condition grounded but determined to try

My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word, her honour to defend
""I will, I will"" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret you won't forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

[Verse 2]
Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
""Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away""

[Verse 2]
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find arе strange
Mesmerizеd as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

[Verse 4]
No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be
No more turning away?

One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane

A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst and he's not the best

And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone as my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

Condition grounded but determined to try

Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

As you look around this room tonight
Settle in your seat and dim the lights
Do you want my blood? Do you want my tears?
What do you want?
(What do you want from me?)
Should I sing until I can’t sing anymore?
Play these strings 'til my fingers are raw?

[Chorus: David Gilmour, Sam Brown, Claudia Fontaine, Durga McBroom & All]
You're so hard to please
What do you want from me?

[Verse 2: David Gilmour, Sam Brown, Claudia Fontaine & Durga McBroom]
Do you think that I know something you don’t know?
(What do you want from me?)
If I don’t promise you the answers, would you go?
(What do you want from me?)
Should I stand out in the rain?
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you?

[Chorus: David Gilmour, Sam Brown, Claudia Fontaine, Durga McBroom & All]
I’m not the one you need
What do you want from me?

[Bridge: David Gilmour]
You can have anything you want
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water
Anything you want
You can own everything you see
Sell your soul for complete control, is that really what you need?
You can lose yourself this night
See inside, there is nothing to hide
Turn and face the light

One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

[Verse 2]
The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst and he's not the best

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
Seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
Man in black on a snow white horse
Pointless life has run its course

When I was burned and broken?
While the days slipped by from my window, watching
And where were you
When I was hurt and I was helpless?
‘Cause the things you say
And the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else’s words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun

[Verse 2]
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life
And the seeds of change were planted
Outside, the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime

I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived for killing the past
And coming back to life

A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word, her honour to defend
""I will, I will"" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret you won't forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

[Verse 2]
Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate that seemed to fit just like a glove?

The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night

Is not gonna help at all
‘Cause there’ll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door

But they tell me to please go fuck myself

Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord

On the day the Wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high, we raised a cry
For freedom had arrived
And on the day the Wall came down
The ship of fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight

[Chorus]
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

[Verse 2]
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there’s a change that even with regret cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history in shades of grey

[Chorus]
I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you

For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
There’s a silence surrounding me
I can’t seem to think straight
I’ll sit in the corner and no one can bother me
I think I should speak now (Why won’t you talk to me?)
I can’t seem to speak now (You never talk to me)
My words won’t come out right (What are you thinking?)
I feel like I’m drowning (What are you feeling?)
I’m feeling weak now (Why won’t you talk to me?)
But I can’t show my weakness (You never talk to me)
I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking?)
Where do we go from here (What are you feeling?)

[Refrain: Stephen Hawking]
It doesn’t have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
(Why won’t you talk to me?) I feel like I’m drowning
(You never talk to me) You know I can’t breathe now
(What are you thinking?) We’re going nowhere
(What are you feeling?) We’re going nowhere
(Why won’t you talk to me?)
(You never talk to me)
(What are you thinking?)
(Where do we go from here?)

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes?

Hey you
Did you ever realize what you'd become?
And did you see
That it wasn't only me you were running from?
Did you know all the time but it
Never bothered you anyway?
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes

Down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you
And the years and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know?

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

From morning to night, I stayed out of sight
Didn’t recognise I’d become—no more than alive
I’d barely survive—in a word, overrun

[Chorus: Richard Wright, Sam Brown, Durga McBroom & Carol Kenyon]
Won’t hear a sound (He’s curled into the corner)
From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)
I’ve spent too long (With an endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out (…curse the place)
My skin is cold (In a sea of random images)
To the human touch (The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart’s (Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much

[Verse 2: Richard Wright]
I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don’t even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light, I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile

My nervous system all awry

Well, he can have the words right from my mouth

And with these words—I can see
Clear through the clouds—that covered me
Just give it time—then speak my name
Now we can hear—ourselves again

For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he’ll)
Have blown away (…curse the place)

Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)

[Verse]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change, did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Runnin' over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end? Will the final couplet rhyme?

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Verse 2]
A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in, there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agеnt are both busy on the phone
Sеlling coloured photographs to magazines back home

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Verse 3]
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You feel the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Lying supine in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]

You run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say...See Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

Abovе the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

Can't keep my mind from the circling skies

Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather round and haggle
For hard cash we will lie and deceive
Even our masters don't know the webs we weave

[Chorus]
One world, it's a battleground
One world and we will smash it down
One world
One world

[Verse 2]
Invisible transfers and long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been takеn, a silent uproar
Has unleashed thе dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun
Signed and sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

The dogs of war won't negotiate
The dogs of war won't capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Well, winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain

One world, it's a battleground

A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word, her honour to defend
""I will, I will"" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret you won't forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

[Verse 2]
Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
""Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away""

[Verse 2]
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find arе strange
Mesmerizеd as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

[Verse 4]
No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be
No more turning away?

One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

[Verse 2]
The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst and he's not the best

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
Seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
Man in black on a snow white horse
Pointless life has run its course
Red-rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sunSee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a wind swept field
Standing alone my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

[Chorus]
Can’t keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

[Chorus]
A soul in tension that’s learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

[Chorus]
There’s no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can’t keep my mind from the circling sky

One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran: a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

[Verse 2]
The use of force, he was so tough
She’ll soon submit, she’s had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He’s just the same as all the rest
He’s not the worst, and he’s not the best

[Verse 3]
And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

[Verse 1]
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises brokenSee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also like1Embed"

[Verse 1]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Verse 2]
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

[Verse 3]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
Its good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spellsSee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

[Verse 2]
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a leading role in a cage?

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground

The same old fears

""Listen son"", said the man with the gun
""There's room for you inside""

I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

[Bridge: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2: David Gilmour and Richard Wright]
Okay
Just a little pin prick *Ding*
There'll be no more ""Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!""
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour and Rachel Brennock/Sam Brown]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numbEmbed"

A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend
""I will, I will"" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won’t forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight

[Verse 2]
Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
""Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away""

[Verse 2]
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be
No more turning away?

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world filled with magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The division bell's ringing had begun
Down the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
See Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also like[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes will stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been a hundred times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder
The light was brighter
The grass was greener
For ever and ever

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change, did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Runnin' over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby
Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad, we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and…

Jumped into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, “This is my last goodbye”

Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in…

Next number from the Pink Floyd
Is also a track on the Saucerful of Secrets LP
It's called, ""Let There Be More Light""

[Verse 1: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Far, far, far, far away – way
People heard him say – say
Something will be done

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Then at last, the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

[Verse 2: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Now, now, now is the time – time
Time to be – be – be aware

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Carter’s father saw him there and knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

[Verse 3: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh, my, something in the sky – sky
Something in my eye – eye
Waiting there for me

The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes was Lucy in the sky

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh – oh – did you ever know – know
Never ever will they
I cannot say

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed

[Outro]
Keep that up and they will be
The Pink Floyd and that was called ""Let There Be More Light""
[?] to London airport
And scream on the 18th when they come back

Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby
Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and...

[Pre-Chorus One: Roger Waters]
Jumped into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, ""this is my last goodbye""

(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

[Verse Two: David Gilmour]
And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in...

Waiting here seems like years
Never seen the light of day

[Verse 2]
All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near

[Chorus 2]
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine showSee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also like1Embed"

Icy wind of night be gone, this is not your domain
In the sky a bird is heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around

[Chorus]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
A river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

[Verse 2]
In the lazy water meadow, I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room

The path you tread is narrow
And the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching
From a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping
Like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end?
Will the final couplet rhyme?

And it’s high time!

A butterfly with broken wings
Is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in
And there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent
Are both busy on the phone

The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you
That they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

Following the path as it leads towards
The darkness in the north
Weary stranger’s faces show their sympathy
They’ve seen that hope before

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Verse 2]
Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can’t conquer all you fears

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit

To the time when love was life with every morning

The path you tread is narrow
And the drop is shear and very high
The ravens all are watching
From a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping
Like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end
Will the final couplet rhyme

[Chorus]
And it’s high time
Cymbaline
It’s high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me

[Verse 2]
A butterfly with broken wings
Is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in
And there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent
Are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs
To magazines back home

[Verse 3]
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you
That they’re moving into range
Doctor Strange is always changing size

The darkness in the North
Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before

But if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know, the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay

But you can't catch the words they say

When the fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
The sound of music in my ears
Distant bells, new mown grass smells
Song sweet
By the river holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down

[Chorus]
And if you see, don’t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

[Verse 3]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Children’s laughter in my ears
The last song-light disappears

And if you see, don’t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

If I were a swan, I’d be gone
If I were a train, I’d be late
And if I were a good man
I’d talk with you
More often than I do

[Verse 2]
If I were to sleep, I could dream
If I were afraid, I could hide
If I go insane, please don’t put
Your wires in my brain

[Verse 3]
If I were the moon, I’d be cool
If I were a rule, I would bend
If I were a good man, I’d understand
The spaces between friends

[Verse 4]
If I were alone, I would cry
And if I were with you, I’d be home and dry
And if I go insane
Will you still let me join in with the game?

[Verse 5]
If I were a swan, I’d be gone
If I were a train, I’d be late again
If I were a good man
I’d talk with you

In a smile I saw a single eagle in the sky
Wheeling, soaring, gliding by

On a hill there lived a man with many shining things
Shiny pool, a shiny car and shiny diamond rings
Wining, dining, shining king

And the eagle flies in clear blue skies
Breathing in the clear blue air
Back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies
And fifty more come rolling off
The Ford production line

Then a man appearing like a mirage on the sand
In his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land
Screaming, dealing, movie man

Here we go, hold your nose and see if something blows
Close your eyes, count to ten and see the sunrise rise
Climbing, high into the sky

By the ornamental lake, a diamond lies
Upon the finger of the king
On high the eagle spies the glitter of a gun
And wheeling in a climbing turn he flies into the sunSee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

This is Radio 1
On medium wave
And this is John Peel with another concert, and this one-
No!
You blew it, you did it all wrong. Anyway, The Pink Floyd!

[Verse 1]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
Last sunlight disappears
Distant bells, new-mown grass smells
So sweet
By the river, holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down

[Chorus]
And if you hear, don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
A silver sound for a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

[Commentary and ""One of These Days"" Introduction]
And if you had listened to this program a year ago, you would have heard the Floyd do Dave Gilmour's ""Fat Old Sun"" then, but it's changed quite a bit, I think, during the past twelve months
This next one is described by Roger Waters as ""a poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation."" Make what you will of that. During the course of it, too, Nick Mason's vocal debut comes round. And although you'll hear his voice, at no time—if you're here in the studio, of course—at no time will you see his lips move, which is something of a technical tour de force. And it's called ""One of These Days, I'm Going to Cut You into Little Pieces,"" or for the benefit of the LP, ""One of These Days.""Embed"

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man, where are you?
So I've changed my gear, and I find my knees
And I covered them up with the latest cut
And my pants and socks all point in a box
They don't make long of my nylon socks
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole
And all the lot is what I got
It's what I wear, it's what you see
It must be me, it's what I am
Vegetable man
I've been looking all over the place for a place for me
But it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere
Vegetable man, vegetable man
He's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can

Bridges burning gladly merging with the shadow
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher

[Verse 2: Richard Wright]
Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way

[Verse 3: Richard Wright & David Gilmour]
Magic vision stirring
Kindled by and burning
Flames rise in her eyes

[Instrumental Bridge]

The door that stands ajar
The walls that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band

Come on, my friends, let's make for the hills
They say there's gold and I’m looking for thrills
You can get your hands on whatever we find
'Cause I'm only comin' along for the ride

[Chorus 1]
Well, you go your way, I'll go mine
I don't care if we get there on time
Everybody's searching for something, they say
I'll get my kicks on the way

[Verse 2]
Over the mountains, across the sea
Who knows what may be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names
Faces of people and places don't change

[Chorus 2]
All I have to do is just close my eyes
To see the seagulls wheeling in those far distant skies
All I wanna tell you, all I wanna say
Is count me in on the journey, don't expect me to stay

You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears, just two eyes

[Verse 2]
You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood’s end, your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
And all the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die
Beneath one infinite sky
There’ll be war, there’ll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turned to rust
All the proud men turned to dust
And so all things, time will mend

And death is a long, cold rest

Eighty years, with luck, or even less

And mind how you go, and I can tell you, ’cause I know

Stay and help me to end the day
And if you don’t mind
We’ll break a bottle of wine
Stick around and maybe we’ll put one down
'Cause I wanna find what lies behind those eyes

[Chorus]
Midnight blue
Burning gold
A yellow moon
Is growing cold

[Verse 2]
I rise, looking through my morning eyes
Surprised to find you by my side
Rack my brain and try to remember your name
To find the words to tell you good-bye

[Chorus]
Morning dues
Newborn day
Midnight blue
Turned to gray

Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and summery

[Chorus 1]
And no one call us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
Starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

[Chorus 2]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Darkness every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inciting and inviting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

[Chorus 3]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the skyEmbed"

Engine taken from a 707
Sounds like a sure way of getting to heaven

Another thing had Bo keeping alive
Was a snub-nosed, Smith And Wesson, Colt 45

Feeling good at the top, shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town
Feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores

Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly, she trips up sweetly
To meet the people, she's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye, then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do cause, I'm feeling very pink

Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

I love she
She loves me
See you
See you
See you

Thought you might like to know
I'm her lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the riverside, feeding ducks in the afternoon tide
(Quack, quack, quack, quack)

Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink (Drink – a – drink – a – drink – a – drink)
(Ah)

[Verse 2]
What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
They're in the scene, oh I should have been
Far away (Away – away – away – away – away)

[Hook]
Getting up, I feel as if I’m remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

[Verse 3]
The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do? — I can’t think what to say
She sees through anyway (Away – away – away – away – away)

Out of the front door I go
Traffic’s moving rather slow
Arriving late
There she waits, looking very angry
As cross as she can be (Be – a – be – a – be – a – be – a – be)

There was a boy whose name was Jim
His friends, they were very good to him
They gave him tea, and cakes and jam
And slices of delicious ham

Hanging in my infant air, waiting
You only have to read the lines of

Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside

It’s awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And I’m most obliged to you for making it clear
That I’m not here
And I never knew the moon could be so big
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I’m grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I’m wondering who could be writing this song

I don’t care if the sun don’t shine
And I don’t care if nothing is mine
And I don’t care if I’m nervous with you
I’ll do my loving in the winter

Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink

In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man, where are you?
So I've changed my gear, and I find my knees
And I covered them up with the latest cut
And my pants and socks all point in a box
They don't make long of my nylon socks
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole
And all the lot is what I got
It's what I wear, it's what you see
It must be me, it's what I am

Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby
Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad, we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and…

[Pre-Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
Jumped into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, “This is my last goodbye”

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in…

And all we've got to say to you is goodbye!
Time gone by in the city when you whine, it's goodbye!
You’re bringin’ Eugene, nobody scream, a goodbye!
We can hang the pilot away, it’s goodbye!
Time has long gone, goodbye!
It’s your last chance, c’mon, say goodbye!

Next number from the Pink Floyd
Is also a track on the Saucerful of Secrets LP
It's called, ""Let There Be More Light""

[Verse 1: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Far, far, far, far away – way
People heard him say – say
Something will be done

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Then at last, the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

[Verse 2: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Now, now, now is the time – time
Time to be – be – be aware

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Carter’s father saw him there and knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

[Verse 3: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh, my, something in the sky – sky
Something in my eye – eye
Waiting there for me

The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes was Lucy in the sky

[Verse 4: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh – oh – did you ever know – know
Never ever will they
I cannot say

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed

Keep that up and they will be
The Pink Floyd and that was called ""Let There Be More Light""

And scream on the 18th when they come back

And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby

Isn't it sad we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and...

Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, ""this is my last goodbye""

Point me at the sky and let it fly

And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in

With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people...

Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?

They’re scribbly black and everything shines

With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time

And I’m grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I’m wondering who could be writing this song

Sitting in a club with so many fools

Trying to impress but feeling rather empty

They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game

Far away (Away – away – away – away – away)

I open the door to an empty room

Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby
Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad, we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and…

Jumped into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, “This is my last goodbye”

Point me at the sky and let it fly

Point me at the sky and let it fly

And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in…

[Verse 1]
“Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain”
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around

[Hook]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

[Verse 2]
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

[Hook]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

The path you tread is narrow, and the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end? Will the final couplet rhyme?

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
It’s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Verse 2]
A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in, there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
It’s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Verse 3]
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore

She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her blind every time

Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned

I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years

Come drifting round my ears
Dark the light and long the night

You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears, just two eyes

[Verse 2]
You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood’s end, your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
And all the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die
Beneath one infinite sky
There’ll be war, there’ll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turned to rust
All the proud men turned to dust
And so all things, time will mend

One, two, free, four!

[Chorus]
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die

[Verse 1]
Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long, cold rest
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye
Eighty years, with luck, or even less

[Verse 2]
So all aboard for the American tour
And maybe you’ll make it to the top
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, ’cause I know
You may find it hard to get off

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man’s son
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
And everyone is still on the run

Hand was fast and his I.Q. high
D.A. said ""Double O, you won't last
Slow down boy, you living too fast""

Well, Double O had a Cadillac
Machine guns and a bullet-proof back
Engine taken from a 707
Sounds like a sure way of getting to heaven

[Verse 3]
In his pocket, 5 pounds of lead
To keep Bo Diddley from getting dead
Another thing had Bo keeping alive
Was a snub-nosed, Smith And Wesson, Colt 45

Well, Bo drank gallons of rye and bourbon
Martini's dry, and you better serve them
Martini so dry, the shaker burst

[Verse 1]
We bitch and we fight
Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do
These times together
Rain or shine or stormy weather
This thing we do
With world-weary grace
We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
Or stay home by the fire, felled by desire
Stoking the flame
But we’re here for the ride
[Chorus]
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words
See Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also like[Verse 2]
The strings bend and slide
As the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
Gonna tap out the rhythm
Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
We're more than alive

[Chorus]
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words
This thing they call soul
Is there with a pulse
Louder than words
Louder than words

Should I stand out in the rain?
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you?

[Chorus: David Gilmour, Sam Brown, Claudia Fontaine, Durga McBroom & All]
I’m not the one you need
What do you want from me?

You were always the golden boy then
And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes?

Hey you
Did you ever realize what you'd become?
And did you see
That it wasn't only me you were running from?
Did you know all the time but it
Never bothered you anyway?
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes

Down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you
And the years and all the sadness fell away from me

On the day the Wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high, we raised a cry
For freedom had arrived
And on the day the Wall came down
The ship of fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight

[Chorus]
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

[Verse 2]
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there’s a change that even with regret cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history in shades of grey

[Chorus]
I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residues slipped away, slipped away

Didn’t recognise I’d become—no more than alive
I’d barely survive—in a word, overrun

Won’t hear a sound (He’s curled into the corner)
From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)
I’ve spent too long (With an endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out (…curse the place)
My skin is cold (In a sea of random images)
To the human touch (The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart’s (Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much

[Verse 2: Richard Wright]
I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don’t even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light, I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile

Clear through the clouds—that covered me
Just give it time—then speak my name
Now we can hear—ourselves again

For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he’ll)

I’ll sit in the corner and no one can bother me
I think I should speak now (Why won’t you talk to me?)

My words won’t come out right (What are you thinking?)

But I can’t show my weakness (You never talk to me)
I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking?)
Where do we go from here (What are you feeling?)

All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

Like shadows into the night

Is not gonna help at all
‘Cause there’ll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door

[Interlude]
""Ladies and gentlemen!
The winner
By a knockout""

[Verse 2]
Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over the door
So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask ""Could we wipe the slate clean?""
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just can’t win

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

[Instrumental]

As you claw the thin ice

Schoolboy, schoolboy, did you hear what I said?
How am I supposed to make you see the light?
It's hard enough to sleepwalk through the day
Without some creepy little boy like you

Bombarding my lonely shell
Glimpses of half-open doors
Gleams in the night that I might well have followed myself

[Verse 2]
Teacher, teacher, you might as well be dead
All those years you tried to suck my brain away
It was hard enough to drag myself from bed
Without some crazy lunatic like you

[Chorus 2]
Bombarding my still softshell
Sticks and stones that you found lying around
In the pile of unspeakable feelings, you found

When you turn back the stone
Turned over the stone
Of your own disappointment

A beautiful girl looked down from the wall
In a grimy frame beside the next attraction
He hid in the queue with his tongue hanging out
Staring up in silent admiration
Deep down near my heart
In the early hours from the lost world in the silver screen
And the silent scream

Ooh, I need a dirty woman

When you know how I need you?
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes

With your fear flowing out behind you

You behind the bench stand, stand still laddy!

When we grew up and went to school
There was a certain teacher who would
Hurt the children any way they could

By pouring this derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known
When he got home at night
His psychopathic wife would crush him

Like the skin on a dying man
And night after night we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older, and
You have grown colder, and
Nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

Run to the bedroom
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
Just one of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?See Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

Come in, sit down
Can you show me where it hurts
Try and tell me in your own words
I must seem very old
But I was young once too
I've seen many others like you
I always say exactly the same thing

[Chorus]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2]
You have to pull yourself together
You have to take it like a man
You mustn't let it get your head down
You should go out and do the town
There's no good moping here alone
Feeling sorry for yourself
Go and see what you can find
It's Saturday night and you should unwindSee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

And keep your dirty feelings deep inside

You better park the car well out of sight
Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother in a cardboard box

Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's all right we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline filling in time
Provided with toys and scouting for boys
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
You didn't like school and you know you're nobody's fool

You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar

Well, I've always had a deep respect and I mean that most sincerely

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?

We're just knocked out, we heard about the sell-out
You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count
Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start, it could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team

[Verse]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

[Acoustic Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

You'll reap the harvest you have sown

And time's your own until you die

Pain in the head is the child of collusion
Gotta resist this creeping malaise
Gotta believe in the way you get out of the maze
But you, you just keep on pretending

But you still raise the knife

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Ticking away
The moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours
In an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground
In your hometown
Waiting for someone
Or something to show you the way
[Chorus: Richard Wright]
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

And you run, and you run
To catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around
To come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older
Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death
[Chorus: Richard Wright]
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

[Part II: Breathe (In the Air) (Reprise)]

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells159Embed"

*clinking coins, a ringing cash register, tearing paper, a clicking counting machine and other items*

[Verse 1]
Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay, and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

[Chorus]
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team
*clinking noises continue*

Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit

And I think I need a Learjet

Come on (Come on, come on), now

Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
[Pre-Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

Stretched to the point of no turning back

Standing alone, my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast

Tongue-tied and twisted

Unheeded warnings, I thought, I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

Condition grounded, but determined to try

Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

Suspended animation, a state of bliss

And build them a home, a little place of their own

And they can appear to themselves everyday
On closed circuit TV
To make sure they're still real
It’s the only connection they feel
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

Mr. Begin and friend
Mrs. Thatcher, and Paisley (Hello Maggie!)
Mr. Brezhnev and party
(Scusi dov'è il bar?)
The ghost of McCarthy,
And the memories of Nixon
And now, adding colour (Da questa parte)
A group of anonymous Latin-American meat packing glitterati
Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?

They can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles,
And abuse themselves playing games for a while
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead

There was a king who ruled the land
His Majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people...

Oh, Mother

Why’d'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines

[Verse 2: Rick Wright]
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time

No one is to blame
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the Queen
His boots were very clean

Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

It’s awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And I’m most obliged to you for making it clear
That I’m not here
And I never knew the moon could be so big
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I’m grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I’m wondering who could be writing this song

I don’t care if the sun don’t shine
And I don’t care if nothing is mine
And I don’t care if I’m nervous with you
I’ll do my loving in the winter

In a churchyard by a river
Lazing in the haze of midday
Laughing in the grasses and the graves

Yellow bird, you are not lone
In singing and in flying on
In laughing and in leaving

Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds

On a trip to Cirrus Minor
Saw a crater in the sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later

Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly

Going always where she pleases

Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting

Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

[Verse 1]
“Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain”
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around

[Hook]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

[Verse 2]
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

[In Old Scot Spoken]
Aye an a bit o' mackerel, fiddler, rack and fear
And I rutted down by the hade and the furrow
Well, I slipped me in a flop and hit down and I shied
And I cried, cried, cried
The fear of fallin' down aft' taken, never back to rise
And then cried 'Mary!' and I tucked up
Wi' a Claymore out and about
And I run down, down the mechyn sty
And beckoned the fiery whore
That was fallin' around the feet
""Never"", I cried. ""Never shall ye get me alive
Ya rotten hound of the Burnie Brae""
Well, I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust
And I fell down before him 'round his feet
(That was pretty avant-garde, wasn't it?)
Aye, a roar he cried! Frae the bottom of his heart
That I would nay fall but dead, dead as a can by a feat deah...
And the wind cried Mary

[Verse 1]
Following the path as it leads towards
The darkness in the north
Weary stranger’s faces show their sympathy
They’ve seen that hope before

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can’t conquer all your fears

Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when love was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the lights will be as clear as on that morning

[Verse 1]
Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello
I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year
[Pre-Chorus]
And I would like to know

[Chorus]
How do you feel?
(How do you feel?)
How do you feel?
(How do you feel?)

[Brass Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need
I felt the cold far too soon in a room of 95
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man?

By the river holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour and Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every day is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spellsSee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"

In a smile I saw a single eagle in the sky
Wheeling, soaring, gliding by

On a hill there lived a man with many shining things
Shiny pool, a shiny car and shiny diamond rings
Wining, dining, shining king

And the eagle flies in clear blue skies
Breathing in the clear blue air
Back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies
And fifty more come rolling off
The Ford production line

Then a man appearing like a mirage on the sand
In his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land
Screaming, dealing, movie man

Here we go, hold your nose and see if something blows
Close your eyes, count to ten and see the sunrise rise
Climbing, high into the sky

By the ornamental lake, a diamond lies
Upon the finger of the king
On high the eagle spies the glitter of a gun
And wheeling in a climbing turn he flies into the sunSee Pink Floyd LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeEmbed"
