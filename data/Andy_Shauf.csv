But only if they find me
Maybe I'll send you down
Give them a clue
Then they'll kill you
And I will ask them

Or what if they ignore you?
Would their fate be the same?

I covered it in leaves

At the moon caught in the leaves

""Halloween is just around the corner""
I was thinking today
Sat around getting high all afternoon
Wondering what I should wear
Eventually, I picked myself up
Put on my shoes and walked out the door
I had one destination in mind
And that destination was the Halloween store

[Verse 2]
I started my car and as I did
I wondered if I’d locked the house
Walked back and found that I hadn't
But now my keys were in the car
Walked to the car, pulled the handle
And it snapped back, at least, I'd locked one door
Reached my hand through the open window
Pulled the lock, forgot about the house
And drove to the Halloween store

[Verse 3]
I pulled into the lot and parked
Next to a blue car like yours
Looked in my rearview mirror
Imagining meeting you in an aisle
I said ""Hi, I'm Norm, I think we've maybe met once before""
And as my fog cleared, I realized
That you were sitting in your car

You spoke in Spanish on the beach
I tried to make up my mind
Whether I could understand a word you said
You took my hand and we walked out
I forgot to lock the door
You stood waiting in a long, dark dress

[Chorus]
I wished it
Could be permanent

[Verse 2]
I feel glamorous, do you?
With my shoes taking shots
Oh, that sound of authority
You speak in Spanish and I turn
To watch the musicians play
Standing straight with their smiling eyes

[Chorus]
I wished it
Could be permanent

[Verse 3]
I wondered what you would have done
If I had bought the ring
And decided to go down on one knee
And in an operatic voice
I would start singing with the band
It would be so mortifying
It makes me laugh

All of your friends started wondering why
You were choking back tears at an easy goodbye
Everything started feeling urgent today
When you open your mouth you have nothing to say

[Chorus]
Jaywalker with your head hung low
You never saw it coming

Moving your lips like you're wanting to smile
Everything that you love always goes out of style
Took a good chance on a triumph or two
Hangin' around town never looked good on you

[Chorus]

You never saw it coming

It's been a few years, you can barely recall
Why the things that you said have you feeling so small
Thirty-one years, now you're up on your feet

He said, “No plans, but I wouldn’t mind holding a lighter head tonight”
I said, “Come to the Skyline, I’ll be washing my sins away”
Oh, he just laughed, said, “I’ll be late, you know how I can be”
I looked in my fridge, it was a dark scene so I buttered some bread
Chewed my way out the door and walked down the street
To the neon Skyline, I grabbed myself a stool at the bar
Oh, somehow Rose always knows just exactly what I need
She didn’t ask, she just opened a cold can and set it down in front of me
I said thanks and thought about how Judy used to come here with me
But I got so tired of her calling this our disease
‘Cause I’m just fine
Sometimes I need to clear my mind, you know how that can be
Charlie walked in about a quarter past ten and I said, “Greetings, old man”
He hung his coat on the wall and took the stool next to mine
He asked Rose for one glass of merlot and she laughed
Oh, I’m just fine, I’m wasting time, sometimes there’s no better feeling than thatSee Andy Shauf LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also likeEmbed"

I think we both knew that's how it would be
And now Charlie's in my left ear, blowing my mind again
As he's saying, ""Did you know Judy's back in town?""

""How long has she been here?
I haven't seen her around""

And I know how I could fix it?

If he saw the tears in Sherry's eyes

I wonder what the hell he did this time

Normally, I wouldn't care to be so bold
Tonight, I think I'll ask her what is wrong
She seems a bit embarrassed and I understand
I say,""I wish that you were having a good time.""

She says ""You know I've never really met someone like you.""
""You know I've never really met someone like you.""

I'm not one to speak up but I've had a few
So I start cutting Jeremy right in two
I say, ""I don't know what you see in him. It seems to me
All he ever does is bring you down.""

I'm spilling my drink as I really start
Tearing one of my best friends apart
She's getting uneasy and my drunken speech
Ends as my hand finds its way to hers
I say, ""You know I've never really met someone like you.""
""You know I've never really met someone like you.""

Stirring me gently and I'll look in your eyes

Where you left in the morning with your keys in your hand

Started your car and drove off into the day
As I slept it away
I was in between jobs and I liked it that way

Jenny come home to me

You got to the city at a quarter to eight
It was then you would learn that your building had burned

Down to the ground it was a terrible sight
And you wondered why nobody'd called in the night

You called up Karen from accounting and made
Some plans for the day
You would meet up for breakfast and maybe try to catch some sales

Jenny come home to me

You got back home about a quarter to four
And when you opened the door
You saw a pair of shoes you'd never seen before

You know, he’s so smart
But he doesn’t care

Jeremy is such a funny guy
He tells me all his jokes
And I laugh so hard
It makes him laugh too

Jeremy let’s me drive his car
I get to hold the wheel
On the highway
On the way home from school

The other day he walked by
With all his stupid friends
And he pretended
He didn’t see me

Wendell Walker was a friend of mine
We'd stain our teeth in the summertime
And with lips of purple, the winter would roll
Past the boarded windows into our souls
And shake our weary bones
Now this past winter was the coldest in years
It's hard to explain if you've never lived here
But it locks your doors and starts your mind
Thinking in circles just to pass the time
And breaks your weary heart
Now Wendell Walker was a man of God
But he didn't care much for his sober mind
And when the cold mixed in he was turned around
Heard the voice of God and the angels sound
A message just for him:

[Refrain]
""My son, my son, she is the devil's child
Won't you save her while you can
Cut down the other man""

[Verse 2]
Now Wendell Walker was a friend of mine
But he married too young in the summertime
Their hearts weren't ripe so they fell apart
And I found myself with a joyful heart
As our secret lives began
We found our moments in between the hours
When Wendell Walker drove his car to town
But one day he found a letter that I wrote for her
On the top of her dresser and in his winter mind
He heard the voice of God say:

""My son, my son, she is the devil's child
Won't you save her while you can
Cut down the other man""

[Verse 3]
With the voice of the lord ringing in his ears
And the note to his wife that confirmed his fears
He sat down on the edge of the bed
Read the letter again to see who'd sent it
But it was signed 'forever yours'
He stood up slow like he'd just been hit
Walked into the kitchen where his wife was sitting
He said, ""my mother called on the telephone
She says she needs some help so I'll be back in the morning""
And he grabbed his heavy coat
My phone rang while I was watching the news
She said the house was ours to cure these winter blues
So I made my way, and we turned the blinds
And Wendell walked in just in time
To see our secret die and say:

[Outro]
""My son, my son I'm gonna have to cut you down""
He pointed his rifle to my eyes
But his hesitating hands
Were shaking from the cold
So I pushed his gun away
Just as he found his strength
And the bullet kissed her lips
And I cried:
""My god, my god what have I done?""
And he reloaded his gun
And he put it in his mouth
And I stood in the room that I'd created4Embed"

Me and a couple friends, we had a big idea
About getting money and getting out of here
We were wide-eyed dreamers of wealth

We were getting tired of killing time
Filling up our heads with cheap wine
Jerry had a van so we could make our escape

[Chorus]
He would say, ""Boys, our time has come
To live among the privileged ones""

[Verse 2]
Now it was Jerry's plan, but we all agreed
Skip town and split the money up evenly
Lay low 'til the winter rolled in

He said, ""I know an old farmer doesn't trust the bank
Keeps his money buried out behind his water tank
He told me once when he was out of his mind""

Now Jerry had a girl, the only one of us
To ever have one last, and so, no questions asked
She'd be the fourth one involved

Her name was Mary-Anne, and she was nice enough
Always a cashier, only once in love
With Jerry - the dreamer and the clerk

[Chorus]
Who said, ""Boys our time has come
To live among the privileged ones""

[Verse 4]
So on that Friday night on which we all agreed
We took our shovels and crept out carefully
Through the farmyard darker than sin

The plan went off without a hitch
'Til we passed the chicken coop and Mary tripped
Turned the hens to sirens in the night

And when the farmhouse lights turned on
A warning shot rang out into the dawn

And we ran like hell for Jerry's van
But when we arrived, we were only three
And while Jerry's greed fed gas to the engine
His words showed us a coward we'd never seen

As he said, ""Boys, our time has come
We're gonna save ourselves and live among the privileged ones""Embed"

My dear Helen, it's been a while since we've talked
Charlie and I haven't been up to a whole lot
He's slowing down a little and my knee's acting up
Yeah, we're quite a pair of geezers, moving slower than molasses
You'd be laughing if you saw us, you always loved to tease

[Verse 2]
I dug up an old bottle of your raspberry wine
So I'm slouched out on the porch swing, just taking my time
My mind keeps turning out these pictures of you
You were dancing in the kitchen, and I was enjoying my view
Oh, Charlie was squirming just two steps behind you

[Verse 3]
My dear Helen, do you remember when you said
That you'd be waiting at the gates so you could sneak me in?
Well it sure was funny, but it still caught in my throat
And when I think about it now, it still makes me choke
And I wonder if those gates would ever open up for me

[Verse 4]
Helen, my dear, I do have something to tell
I don't know how to start, so I guess I just will
See, these nights have been hot, it's that muggy sort of air
Doesn't let me get to sleep, so I usually just lie there
On top of my quilt with Charlie by my feet

Last night, as I laid there frustrated and tired
I was sat up in my bed by the hens starting wild
I thought, 'That fox is back again, he's gonna rob me blind
I don't know how he gets in, but I'd better make him fly'
So I took my leaning rifle out the door

[Verse 6]
I fired off a shot, aiming far into the heat
And as soon as it was flying, I felt weak in my knees
I heard shoes turning gravel and then tires spitting rocks
I heard a gasp for air, and my stomach tied in knots
Charlie started whining with his tail between his legs
We wandered out slow, but my heart was breaking ribs
I couldn't hear nothing, and there was a girl lying twisted
My hands were trembling and I felt that she was limp
Her pulse wasn't tapping, so I felt sick to my stomach
Charlie was frozen, so I went for a shovel
And I buried her body, I didn't know what else to do
If I'd only aimed a little higher, if I'd only thought before I fired
I hope God can forgive me, I hope for you to forgive me, too
I'm just a tired old man, just waiting to join you
So here I am, slouched on this old porch swing
Thinking about heaven, thinking about everything
So be waiting by those gates, you might need to sneak me in

Paint on the walls
And smoke on my collars
Rings on my friends' left hands
Dark are the days
Understanding the ways
That I left town to reach your feelings
Well I -- I don't really know you anymore

[VERSE 2]
Telephone calls
Pills in my wallet
Rings on my friends' left hands
Whiskey in glasses
Poured out in ounces
While I was praying for clouds
Well I -- I don't really know you anymore

[VERSE 3]
Shirts holding moles to dirty clothes for laundry
And rings on my friends' left hands
Money for gas
Cigarettes for my cash
And receipts in my glovebox, too

Winter is coming in through the closed doors
I have been waiting for this
Summer will go and will make room for snow
Start getting ready for the cold

[VERSE]
If I am the wintertime, then you are the spring
You're always full of new colors
I'll take the leaves off of every single tree
And you'll always beautifully recover


If I was stronger than I've ever been
Would you stay here by my side?
Or would you think since I'm now stronger a man
That I don't need someone to lean on?
Well I think the strong man needs somewhere to lean
I think he gets a little tired
Then we emphasize strong, and we leave off the man
Strong is only part of the title

[Chorus]
And so winter is coming in through the closed doors
I know you've been dreading this
We're losing our warmth
And we're losing our freedom

Darling open your eyes
The sun came up
It's just disguised
With a raincoat on
You'll keep a fire inside
Without your glasses you're blind
You took them off so you could find
A brand new way to see familiarity

And on a hill that you climbed
Near summer's end by autumn's side
You gazed into a universal sky
And lost in deeper thoughts
You found a way to understand
Past a ticking clock strapped to the back of your hand

To put my pen to use
I wrote it out a hundred times
But it never seemed as true
As when I stumbled home
And felt the words upon my lips
You grabbed me by my arms
And smelled the liquor in my truth

I said, ""I'm swimming in a cage...""

The morning grows in silence
And I watched it fill the room
Earlier than dawn
You crept into the kitchen's light
You always were an early bird
And I was always tired
So I laid in bed alone, awake
And thought about the coming day

I said, ""I'm swimming in a cage""
""I'm swimming in a cage...""

I folded up my page
And left it by the kitchen sink
Where I knew that you would find it
When you came back from the yard
You'd be setting down the basket
Full of apples from the tree
And with two hands you would open up my letter
And begin to read:

with lines of longing for your touch
or of holding you so tightly

Don't hold back with what you say
You're speaking louder than you ever thought you could before

Darker days
Move away
To bigger cities where you hide with everything you hate

And roads walk
People talk
You're moving slower than you ever thought you could before

And pleasant things
Like birds that sing
Are staying quiet 'cause they're tired of the old songs

Will you write something new
Will you find another town to travel to
Will you miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
When everything's leaving

Will you write something new
Will you find another town to travel to

To pack all my things and make this long journey home
There's a dark icy road and there's a man on TV
And he's talking so fast about the reasons why I can't leave

There's a bottle of beer on a bus driver's mind
There's a time and a place and he's eager to find
There's a waitress' birthday on the second of June
And it's taking forever for her to turn twenty-two

There's a saying in my mind I've heard it before
They're the kind of words that you start to ignore
It's less of a truth than a question of time
That good things come to those who wait

So how long will I wait?
Oh how long will I wait?
Oh how long will I wait?
How long will I wait?

Of all the ones he tripped up on the way
He sits down in the moonlight, wipes his tears
Staring at the white rose that he placed
In front of the grave he visits each day since she slipped away

The devil hides his blue eyes in his hand
He wipes away the last tears as he stands
He hears her voice so clearly on the breeze
She's singing like an angel to his weakest knees
So he twists off the cap and tips his head back for that sweet relief

The devil's walking slowly on the street
Towards his empty condo where he'll creep
The silence of his bedroom before he slips

He's pointing his toes towards the night
Waiting for a cab maybe, but I dont mind
Well he's got things that i once had

Death walks with confidence,
No-one dares to love him
He's around the corner,
Breaking bones and icing the highways

[Verse 2]
He's a workaholic,
And the friend of a drunk
Whispering in his ear,
Saying ""man it's only three blocks from here""

[Verse 3]
Does he work for the government?,
Does he work alone?
Is he the wages of sin?,
'Cos he's at my door and he reeks of gin

[Chorus]

And that's no way to live

Move away
To bigger cities where you hide with everything you hate

And roads walk

And pleasant things
Like birds that sing
Are staying quiet 'cause they're tired of the old songs

Will you find another town to travel to
Will you miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
When everything's leaving

There's a bottle of beer on a bus driver's mind
There's a time and a place and he's eager to find
There's a waitress' birthday on the second of June
And it's taking forever for her to turn twenty-two

There's a saying in my mind I've heard it before
They're the kind of words that you start to ignore
It's less of a truth than a question of time
That good things come to those who wait

So how long will I wait?
Oh how long will I wait?
Oh how long will I wait?
How long will I wait?

Better things are coming soon, my friend
I'll fall asleep with so much on my mind
And in the morning I'll awake, and forget what I need to find

Grand piano songs you'd play for me
Your softest voice I hear it trace the melody
And I'll fall asleep with so much on my mind
And in the morning I'll awake, and forget what I need to find

Colder hands will come when leaves begin to fall
And winter's white will follow soon and hide them all

Like the time that we held hands on the bus ride home
And the words that you were feeding from the book that you were reading
I never understood them quite, but I wanted to. yeah, I wanted to

I know I'm not the only one who has loved you
And I know I'm not the only one who cares
And the love song that I wrote for you will never be your favourite
But I won't take it back, I won't take it back

I know it's not original to say that I've missed you
But that's what keeps on coming back to me
Like a dusty old folk song in the key of C
Or something that can only be a memory

I have never been that good with words, but I hope you see
You mean so much to me

Lies silent on the earth
Where I could never be
And the brightest sun that's ever shined
As you walk away
It dances there behind, or so I find
But it's all the same anyway

I'll hold you in the setting sun
Would that be boring
Would it be any fun for you
Maybe I could fix your pain
But what is life if it's always sunny
If there's never any rain
If it's all the same anyway, then it's all the same anyway

You are the mittens to my coldest hands
The purest rain to the driest lands
A brand new friend on a lonely day
Most beautiful girl I'd have to say
Please be mine on this very night
Hands are shaking, knees not quite
It's all the same anyway, well maybe it was but not today

Easier than most, most of the time
And I'll stay by your bedside
Till morning hides the night like a steady machine
And the sun will seem brighter again
And your eyes will be rivers as you're telling your best friend
I might not see you again

And I'll stay by your bedside
I'm stronger than eye sight, most of the time
I'll be like a brick wall
With legs braced I won't fall, I'm a steady machine
But my eyes will grow tired again
And I'll fall into dreams where you're getting out of bed
And becoming whole again

And my eyes are tired
My tears are stains
The clock keeps moving on
There's a selfishness in all of this
And I am holding tightly to your hand
But your grip is gone
And I'm losing hope
And quietly but still out loud I'll say

And nobody knew how to say
That a funeral voice was the easier choice
To saying goodbye to me

I know what I've seen in the towns in-between
Where the faces remind me of you
It's been at me all day, I just want to say
But I choke when I think about you

And I've been so afraid to get lost on the way
That I don't even know where to go
And this moment of blind, it helps me to find
A hand to lead me home

I heard yesterday that you're at home to stay
It's been so long since I've seen your face
You're alive and you're well, but it's not hard to tell
That I'm terrified to hear your voice againSee Andy Shauf LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also likeEmbed"

Stood in his kitchen
Cleaning a knife
Wondering what it would be like
To plunge that knife into anything

Looked at his sofa
Smiled a half smile
Imagining how she would react
To a bunch of holes in the cushions

Jacob Rose
Walked out the back door
Knelt in the moonlight
And raised the knife over his head
He brought it down fast towards the soil

Jacob Rose
His hand was on fire
The knife hit a rock
And his palm slid down the blade
He looked around and he saw no one

Back in the kitchen
Blood in thе sink
Wondering how he would explain
