Full of vanilla, flyin' over chocolate mountains
I stare at the Pacific while I'm smokin' on a kilometer
The feds, they hot on us, one hundred on the thermometer
They raided my private plane, I went got one that's more privater
R.I.P. Juice WRLD, wrote that on two cups
Cuz pour out a lil' juice for him, shit gave me goosebumps
Nigga been through too much, lookin' in the rearview to see the future

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And that just don't sit right
Living like I can't die, Bumbu in me
FBI arrest me, why?
They can't nail me so thеy just screw with me
I just try, try to hide
Somеtimes it's hard to find time to be the good guy and still be someone
Enjoyin' my good times more than sometimes, and I just hope

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I don't get time 'cause I ain't got time
I was high as fuck yesterday, damn, time flies

Huh, South Beach, spring, California, autumn, winter
I ain't talkin' shit, I'm garglin' the toilet water
Ballin' harder, Glock 40 on me, that's the party starter
In the cell starin' at the bars like I'm on the charger
Came out at a hundred percent, money to spend
Nothin' to lose and somethin' to win, once and again
Jumped in the pool with her and her friend, none of us swim
Bussin' a move like bumps on her skin, nuts on her chin
Fuckin' with Tune just doesn't make sense, gun in my clench
Gun is so huge, I can't tuck it in, it's cuttin' my wind
Chuggin' the juice, my cup got a twin, this one is for Pimp
This one is for Screw and this one is for Nip, pour out and sip
Bubble gum cookin' banana leaves flip, Nevada heat list
Champagne, Tropicana, sweet blend, Cabana weekend
Bitches tannin', poppin' Xannies, deep end, barely blinkin'
Twirlin' on the dick like ballerinas and balance beamin'

San Juan summer, sweating winter off
Talkin' prices, goin' back and forward like a tennis ball
Talkin' business, guns start ringin', that's a business call
It's only business, take a nigga chain like it's his business card
Clips extended, hangin' out the banger, that's extension cords
He's a pussy, he can't do a thing, now that's just menopause
Bitch made and I'm the switchblade that's sharper than a sword
I gotta stay up 'cause who gon' catch a blade when it fall?
Politickin' in the penthouse like it's the Pentagon
And we feedin' sharks on the yacht, throwin' niggas off
Can't believe the thots ever thought they'd throw a nigga off
Archer greens, sparks red dots glowin' in the dark
Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and all my pillows soft
Talkin' all that gangsta shit, how loud the sound of pillow talk
Steady is the hand that whip around the pot, I'm kitchen smart
Becky give me head, open her so wide, I hit her heart
Becky give me head, and use no Uzi, that's for intercourse
Becky give me head, and use my pubic hair as dental floss
Then of course, I put on all red, hop up in a Porsche
Fast lane, it's a man's game, meet me center court
Any sport, 24/7, no 8, nigga
Mamba mentality but we ain't got no snakes with us
They slither, diamonds in mouth look like I ate glitter
And bae brought her bae with her, double play, nigga, ooh

Ooh, no bikini, ooh, no demeanor
I just put it all up in her face, woah, Noxzema

I ain't Aaron Rodgers 'cause I'm still on that pack, nigga
Still got twelve on my motherfuckin' back, nigga
Came home from jail, they was tryna send me back, nigga
I just called my nigga Donald Trump and that was that, nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Fuckin' all night long when I wake up, I could barely walk
Money callin' me, I said, ""Hello?"" That shit said, ""Can we talk?""
Don't care who these rappers are
They shit sound sound like salad bars
Countin' so much money, I'ma need a hand massage
I sip that sip like that sip Frappuccino
I wore a tuxedo to cook up a kilo
I'm in the kitchen lookin' like Al Pacino
Whippin' Aquafina 'til it's Pellegrino
Shout out the C.O. that gave me some pussy in jail
On the d-low, she one, doublе zero
Shout out the freak ho that I gavе the lead role
But this is a b-roll, lowkey had me emo, fuck

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Euro]
I ain't a killer but you pushin' me
I smoke your lil ass like some kushery
I burn your lil ass like a DVD
I caught my lil' ho with a EBT
I think this ho thinking 'bout havin' ten of me
Ten of me, ten of me, ten of me
She want some company, she want some misery
She want some Tiffany's, bitch, you a Heffany
I know the bad times won't ever replace the good (The good)
I got some new money comin' in, gotta make room (Check)

Instead of me holdin' a trophy, I'd rather my brothers
I got a homie who stay in the field on the mountain
Had a hell of a splitter but now he inside and he totin' a cutter
They put a lil' thing on the side that go clickin'
And make it go, ""Brr"", smoother than butter
And I'm always tellin' myself
""Just 'cause he showin' me love, it do not mean they love us""
I'm takin' my time and can nobody rush us
Said she got a man with a whole lot of rules
And she breakin' em all so I'm doin' her justice
Don't leave me alone, I never did trust us
Too many eyes on the team
Like I'm sendin' a text with no auto-correct, uh, uh
Say she a virgin until she get fucked like a slut on the jet
I only come to collect
I'ma go through all the threat without makin' a threat
Shit is a movie, it's lookin' like Tubi
And I'm seein too many flaws in your set
Still on road and I came off tourin'
And I ain't shit but I'm still important
I don't judge and I do no courtin'
It ain't nothin' left when I take my portion
We gon' die enormous, playin' no games and I still be scorin'
Ain't shit pretty, my bitch is gorgeous
Now that man in the mirror ain't normal

I ain't a killer but you pushin' me

Five star the blicky, I rep for the five
Cum on that bitch, she a snail full of slime
Pull the trigger like the tail of a lion
Four finger ring, leave a ring 'round your eye
Buss down brass knuckles, she wink and I fuck her
You blink and I bluck her, that Nina I'm tuckin'
Just call me Big Buzzalino, I'm buzzin'
I let the stick talk for me, I'm a puppet
Oh, yeah, fuck around, you gon' get sprayed (Sprayed)
Hey, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I see the hate everywhere in my eyes
Lil' bae just text, ""Where you at?"" No reply
I skeet in her face, she laid back, open wide
Before we had cake, niggas had humble pie
I smell like cream and Chanel Number 5
You smell Codeine when I belch, FYI
I put OG in the L, that's a log
Choppa gon' ring like, ""Hello? It's for y'all"" (Hello?)
Coco Chanel
All of my niggas, their logo Chanel
I'm only puttin' West Coast in the L
Okay, okay, now I'm smokin' Chanel

I don't fuck with pussies, but I keep a tight circle
Yeah, all I wear is designer-like work clothes
Dirty South nigga, bitch, come ride me like a dirt road
One, two, three, four Percs, light work though
Ski, ski, ride a nigga like, ""Skrrt, skrrt,"" ho
Yeah, in a fur coat, yeah, no shirt though
Ten toes down on the ground, no turf toe
I'm with a housewife, I dig her out twice
And then we chill and talk about life and organize heists
And if I feel it's organized right and authorized right
Then I'm walkin' out nice, can't slip, walkin' on water, not ice
In the worstest conditions, I still have pеrfect attendance
I'm from whеre the innocent mothers givin' birth to defendants
This Earth is a prison, serve my purpose before I'm finished
Servin' my sentence, work relentless to get no further than inches
That hurt when it isn't, courtesy given', currency earned
Price on my head, I'm straight though, like the money a perm
Got money to burn 'til judgment day, court is adjourned
Get out of order with me, nigga, get your order returned
Now who want smoke with me? That's a joke to me

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I say, ""Are you on your way?""
She say, ""Where the Uber at?""
I said, ""I'll meet you at my gate"", and wait
Wait 'til you see your Uber driver's face
And I'll buy you lingerie
Yeah, I just hope you in the mood for that
Or we can talk and spark a J, lil' bae
Then, you get too faded, now you gotta stay
Either way, now you're fuckin' on a nigga from the Eastside
Yeah, and it's 'bout to get ugly
Turn around, I hit it from the B side
Yeah, make her scream, ""Young Money""Embed"

Good morning

[Verse]
Skip the BS and put everybody after VS
P.S., all I spit is F-A-C-T-S
The best, Skip Bayless, yeah, say less
Top of the top, apex, everyday flex
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin', I ain't tryna hate
Let's have a Jordan and Lebron debate, I got time today
Drippin' on the chain, my diamonds say what they gotta say
If you think it's a game, I commentate, I ain't got to play
On in the mornin', I own my opponent
My competition is not an issue, just cotton tissue, uh
Unconventional, controversial, convoluted
Unconditional, undeterred, and undisputed
No mercy (No mercy), no mercy
Unconvеntional, controversial, convoluted
This the nеw ""Undisputed""
Now let's go face to face, I embrace debate
I don't make mistakes, I just make my case
Drops mic' when I'm done, what more can I say?
Not bitin' my tongue, I don't like the taste

[Bridge]
And I won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down
Won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down
Won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down

Huh, South Beach, spring, California, autumn, winter
I ain't talkin' shit, I'm garglin' the toilet water
Ballin' harder, Glock 40 on me, that's the party starter
In the cell starin' at the bars like I'm on the charger
Came out at a hundred percent, money to spend
Nothin' to lose and somethin' to win, once and again
Jumped in the pool with her and her friend, none of us swim
Bussin' a move like bumps on her skin, nuts on her chin
Fuckin' with Tune just doesn't make sense, gun in my clench
Gun is so huge, I can't tuck it in, it's cuttin' my wind
Chuggin' the juice, my cup got a twin, this one is for Pimp
This one is for Screw and this one is for Nip, pour out and sip
Bubble gum cookin' banana leaves flip, Nevada heat list
Champagne, Tropicana, sweet blend, Cabana weekend
Bitches tannin', poppin' Xannies, deep end, barely blinkin'
Twirlin' on the dick like ballerinas and balance beamin'

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
And y'all bitches look excellent on my dick
Y'all bitches go equestrian on my dick
Go extra-terrestrial on my dick
Head spinnin' like ""The Exorcist"" on my dick

Don't slip on this banana clip, get y'all ass split

[Verse 2]
San Juan summer, sweating winter off
Talkin' prices, goin' back and forward like a tennis ball
Talkin' business, guns start ringin', that's a business call
It's only business, take a nigga chain like it's his business card
Clips extended, hangin' out the banger, that's extension cords
He's a pussy, he can't do a thing, now that's just menopause
Bitch made and I'm the switchblade that's sharper than a sword
I gotta stay up 'cause who gon' catch a blade when it fall?
Politickin' in the penthouse like it's the Pentagon
And we feedin' sharks on the yacht, throwin' niggas off
Can't believe the thots ever thought they'd throw a nigga off
Archer greens, sparks red dots glowin' in the dark
Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and all my pillows soft
Talkin' all that gangsta shit, how loud the sound of pillow talk
Steady is the hand that whip around the pot, I'm kitchen smart
Becky give me head, open her so wide, I hit her heart
Becky give me head, and use no Uzi, that's for intercourse
Becky give me head, and use my pubic hair as dental floss
Then of course, I put on all red, hop up in a Porsche
Fast lane, it's a man's game, meet me center court
Any sport, 24/7, no 8, nigga
Mamba mentality but we ain't got no snakes with us
They slither, diamonds in mouth look like I ate glitter
And bae brought her bae with her, double play, nigga, ooh

I ain't Aaron Rodgers 'cause I'm still on that pack, nigga
Still got twelve on my motherfuckin' back, nigga
Came home from jail, they was tryna send me back, nigga
I just called my nigga Donald Trump and that was that, nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Fuckin' all night long when I wake up, I could barely walk
Money callin' me, I said, ""Hello?"" That shit said, ""Can we talk?""
Don't care who these rappers are
They shit sound sound like salad bars
Countin' so much money, I'ma need a hand massage
I sip that sip like that sip Frappuccino
I wore a tuxedo to cook up a kilo
I'm in the kitchen lookin' like Al Pacino
Whippin' Aquafina 'til it's Pellegrino
Shout out the C.O. that gave me some pussy in jail
On the d-low, she one, doublе zero
Shout out the freak ho that I gavе the lead role
But this is a b-roll, lowkey had me emo, fuck

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Euro]
I ain't a killer but you pushin' me
I smoke your lil ass like some kushery
I burn your lil ass like a DVD
I caught my lil' ho with a EBT
I think this ho thinking 'bout havin' ten of me
Ten of me, ten of me, ten of me
She want some company, she want some misery
She want some Tiffany's, bitch, you a Heffany

And make it go, ""Brr"", smoother than butter
And I'm always tellin' myself
""Just 'cause he showin' me love, it do not mean they love us""
I'm takin' my time and can nobody rush us
Said she got a man with a whole lot of rules
And she breakin' em all so I'm doin' her justice
Don't leave me alone, I never did trust us

Like I'm sendin' a text with no auto-correct, uh, uh
Say she a virgin until she get fucked like a slut on the jet

It ain't nothin' left when I take my portion
We gon' die enormous, playin' no games and I still be scorin'
Ain't shit pretty, my bitch is gorgeous
Now that man in the mirror ain't normal
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I ain't a killer but you pushin' me
I smoke your lil ass like some kushery
I burn your lil ass like a DVD
I caught my lil' ho with a EBT
I think this ho thinking 'bout havin' ten of me
Ten of me, ten of me, ten of me
She want some company, she want some misery
She want some Tiffany's, bitch, you a Heffany
I know the bad times won't ever replace the good (The good)
I got some new money comin' in, gotta make room (Yeah)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I ain't Aaron Rodgers 'cause I'm still on that pack, nigga
Still got twelve on my motherfuckin' back, nigga
Came home from jail, they was tryna send me back, nigga
I just called my nigga Donald Trump and that was that, niggaEmbed"

I'm twisting medicinal
Pissing medicinal, spittin' that clinical

Pockets pregnant, bitch tryna clip the umbilical
I ain't simple or typical, gentle or general
Nigga, I'm nuts, no genitals
I fell in love with them chemicals
I bust a few nuts and she swim in 'em
These niggas act tough and they feminine
Play no games, nigga, not even scrimmagin'
These niggas can't see me, no imagery
My pockets so fat, they hemorrhagin'
Damn, that's an injury, I gotta keep the same energy
My soda pink with that remedy
I can't rеst in peace 'cause thеy diggin' me, shit
Big Tune, I lick shots, them niggas lick wounds
Shoot up everything but the kids room
I walk out the bank like the men's room
I got paper like I'm a tribune
I fly a bitch out like a witch broom
I run in her mouth like some gym shoes
Cum all over her face, now her skin smooth

[Verse: Lil Wayne]

Wait, I'm a baboon, I'm a tycoon
Bitch, it's Lil' Tune, elephant in the room
I'm the shit, the perfume, I'm the salt in the wound
And I walk on the moon, it's like carpet to Tune
I thought you was a goon, well take off the costume
You soft as balloons, I play darts with balloons
Yeah, I make your heart, ""Boom-boom-boom""
Yeah, I break her heart like the rules, yeah
Wait, I'm livin' the dream, pimpin' the green
Sippin' the lean, give me a bean
Feelin' serene, I'm here with a queen
She here for a ring, I'm killin' her dreams
I'm killin' the scene, a nigga a king
They kissin' the ring, it blingity-bling

I bought my bitch some Chanel Number 5
Five star the blicky, I rep for the five
Cum on that bitch, she a snail full of slime
Pull the trigger like the tail of a lion
Four finger ring, leave a ring 'round your eye
Buss down brass knuckles, she wink and I fuck her
You blink and I bluck her, that Nina I'm tuckin'
Just call me Big Buzzalino, I'm buzzin'
I let the stick talk for me, I'm a puppet
Oh, yeah, fuck around, you gon' get sprayed (Sprayed)
Hey, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I see the hate everywhere in my eyes
Lil' bae just text, ""Where you at?"" No reply
I skeet in her face, she laid back, open wide
Before we had cake, niggas had humble pie
I smell like cream and Chanel Number 5
You smell Codeine when I belch, FYI
I put OG in the L, that's a log
Choppa gon' ring like, ""Hello? It's for y'all"" (Hello?)
Coco Chanel
All of my niggas, their logo Chanel
I'm only puttin' West Coast in the L
Okay, okay, now I'm smokin' Chanel
Rich as a bitch, I'm like Oprah, Chanel
All of these niggas, they broker than nails

They don't acknowledge but dip in the well
I got a Grammy while clippin' my nails
Huh, I ain't gotta prove shit, I could scream in this bitch
Got the pop bitches rockin' now, then switch
New sound, new wig, new cadence, brand new style
You could copy now, I'm singin' like, ""Mm-hmm, alright""
I ain't gotta try hard, it's so light
Got all of this green, it's go time
I'm making a mil in no time
They sayin' shit gettin' spooky
So I put my money on Tunechi
I put my heart in that loose leaf
So I never trust, never lose sleep

Bitch, I'm on one, two, three, four Percs, light work though
I don't fuck with pussies, but I keep a tight circle
Yeah, all I wear is designer-like work clothes
Dirty South nigga, bitch, come ride me like a dirt road
One, two, three, four Percs, light work though
Ski, ski, ride a nigga like, ""Skrrt, skrrt,"" ho
Yeah, in a fur coat, yeah, no shirt though
Ten toes down on the ground, no turf toe
I'm with a housewife, I dig her out twice
And then we chill and talk about life and organize heists
And if I feel it's organized right and authorized right
Then I'm walkin' out nice, can't slip, walkin' on water, not ice
In the worstest conditions, I still have pеrfect attendance
I'm from whеre the innocent mothers givin' birth to defendants
This Earth is a prison, serve my purpose before I'm finished
Servin' my sentence, work relentless to get no further than inches
That hurt when it isn't, courtesy given', currency earned
Price on my head, I'm straight though, like the money a perm
Got money to burn 'til judgment day, court is adjourned
Get out of order with me, nigga, get your order returned
Now who want smoke with me? That's a joke to me
Shoot up your block and double back 'cause I got OCD

Bangladesh
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derrière
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch, haha
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour, haha
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me

But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion

Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ahem
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish, ha!

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side
Bitch, I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart

How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
And I got my gun in my boo purse

And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, 'cause I made more off my second leg

Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at

And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes

You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‘Cause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off

Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye

Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap

Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors

Yeah, I put my shades on

[Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

And I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'

All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him"" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothing, keep resting,""
She say, ""What's missing?""—""How you know something missing?""
He scratched his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,""
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, ""Ooh""

Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,""
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me a salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier!""
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
For a minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself

She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,""

All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it

Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-

It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro

Light the J like I be Leno'in, the bae I'm ignoring
Blow the paper like a vent blowing, just like some lint blowing

Beautiful diamonds dancing likе they're in a musical

I stand back and admire my art and kiss my fingers
And in God I trust, mwah

'Cause we ain’t tryna talk it out
Pistol hangin’ out my jeans, it ain’t a thing, let's spark it out
Let that chopper start to sing and let it ring, and then I’m out
Yeah, you know what I’m sippin’, purple got me trippin’
Scoop your chicken up and let her lick me like a lizard
I’m on South Beach chillin’, and I’m tryna fuck e'ry hottie
Get her to the crib and make her fuck e'rybody
You know the team, it’s Young Money over e'rybody
In the rap game, so it’s, ""Fuck e'rybody""

Fuq' got the weed, Marl' got the gun
They say numbers don't lie; bitch, I'm not the one
Hammers in your face, this is not a dream
And you're getting every page of this magazine
Bumping UGK, talking about a murder
We roll a Dr. J and then we light that Julius Erving
I got pussy on the way and pussy on the way out
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out
Tunechi, Tunechi, tote the toolie, fuck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl, call it Lady Gaga!
Glock 4-tini, nina colada
Suck, swallow; semen, saliva
I am going at your collar; fuck you hoe niggas
Weezy go hard, you bitches go figure
Diamonds in my teeth like I'm a fucking dope dealer

If you're scared, go to church and get a scripture tat
Guns the size of children; now, don't be childish
Be with wild-ass niggas, and I am the wildest
I'm a motherfucker; call me Weezy, baby
And on the end of the barrel, I got a sweet potato
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady
I got the world in my hands, skateboard and my Vans
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran

Uh
Dana text me and say she wanna see me
Then sent a picture of her in the mirror
No clothes on, of course
She want that dope dick, hello, world, I'm the dope dealer
I love it when she talk crazy
That dick make her walk crazy
And last time was awesome
All the lines, we crossed 'em
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
I O. J. Simpson that pussy
Ha, yeah, that's the shit
Pussy taste so good, make you smack your lips
I don't know about you, but I'm a beast with mine
She say she waitin' for the Carter 69, ha
Ha, I told her, ""Sorry for the wait""
I value her time like an Audemars Piguet
And we gon' stay current like the water in a lake
Yeah, we gon' fuck around like we fuckin' in a circle
Ha, pardon the slur, that's the purple
It feels so real like it's virtual
Any kind of position, she's versatile
And she take it every way except personal, haha
Yeah, that's my bitch
Pussy wetter than a wishin' well, I wish
I was in it right now instead of makin' this song
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the end zone
Don't trip when I say I can't see ya
And she say she workin' on her career
Smoke got our eyes lookin' like we're from Korea
We floatin', but I'ma rock the boat like Aaliyah
RIP, shorty got me
And shorty knows I fucks with her, hard body
Shorty fine by me, spend some time by me
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree
I know what's on your mind, fine
Yeah, we can do whatever that is
She tell me that it's mine, I say, ""Fine""
Shit, I was taught to live and let live
So go and live it up, baby, giddy-up, baby
It's your world, ain't tryna interrupt, but maybe
We movin' too fast, but, fuck it, let's crash
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now it feel lovely, it feel great
I slide her: safe, ha
Yeah, yeah, all that good shit
No, I ain't a player, I just play it by the bullshit
I know what I'm doin', and she love how I do it
She throw that ass back and she never over-do it
Ha, she call me ""baby"" and I call her ""bae""

Kush in the Swisher, money over bitches
Never kill a woman, unless she a witness
All about my business, survival of the fittest
She let me hide my weed in her titties
Bitch, I got the cash, in a rubberband
I got the Glock, already cocked, boom!
Fucking with a nigga, meet my motherfucking goons
Sorry 4 the Wait, Carter IV coming soon
Light it up, cause I’ma smoker
She tried to deepthroat, I fucked around and choked her
It’s Young Money, motherfucker, game over
Shots leave your body, looking like you doing yoga
And Lord knows I'm a sinner, pain pills for dinner
Bitch, I'm getting money like I got a money printer
Got a chopper and a trimmer, shooting like Jimmer
You coming in that water, boy, you better be a swimmer
I ain't worrying bout y’all, sitting on my Hog
While Miss Anita Baker sing ""You Bringing Me Joy""
I came straight outta jail and did my thing on these boys
And we all yelled, “Fuck you, bitch!” and kept going
I'm on, and that’s right, baby
I ain't going out this bitch without a fight, baby
One request: please don’t bite, baby
I got some bomb-ass pussy from a white lady
I ain't lying, I’ma shine like a nickel or a diamond
I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind
Girl, stop talking that shit
Go on and suck a nigga dick for a new outfit, hahaha
And even if the sky come falling
Bitch, I’ma still be high
I got faith in my weedman
My lil niggas got yay' by the beanbag
Hit your ass from the side like a screen pass
And that red bandana is the team flag

Ayy, gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Stove on my waist, cook your ass up, gourmet
All-black four-four, do you want foreplay?
I'm going at your face like Oil of Olay
No champagne, but you know my flag rosé
Swagger on steroids: Canseco, Jose
No Limit Records: We so 'bout it 'bout it
I'm higher than a bitch, feel like I climbed a fucking mountain
Illest nigga you know, my accountant still counting
Shot hit him a minute ago, but his body still bouncing
Beam on the hammer, beam on your forehead
Gotta kill the witnesses 'cause Birdman car red
Hollygrove Monster, Eagle Street creature
Come to your funeral, kill everybody but the preacher
I live in Miami, nigga, I'll South Beach you
Robin Leach—uh, that's how we ballin'
You know that I'm loaded, but please don't think it's sweeter
Beat one of you bitch niggas up like John Cena
Them hoes on Young Money, tell them hoes we coming
Boy, we get it popping, we ain't saving hoes, we swapping
Yeah, gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Big-head Desert Eagle, call it Sade
I just get that money, Stunna taught me that
That Xan took me under, Patrón brought me back
I'm leaning on these motherfuckers like I caught a flat
And that Glock snap back like an old Starter hat, haha!
What the lick read? I'm in the big league
I'm a breath of fresh air—let the bitch breathe
I'm tryna chillax, but I had to do it, Dev
I'm at the funeral, like, ""I had to do it, Rev.!""
Mack, you my big brother, I'll split a wig for you
Put that on Mary P., until they bury me
Moment of clarity—yeah, that's my diamond game
I keep a fine bitch 'cause I like the finer things

I can't fuck with ho niggas; I can't trust these hoes, neither
Wake up early in the mornin', eat that pussy like cold pizza
Hatin'-ass niggas be baller blockin', actin' like some goalkeepers
There's a reason for everything, but my niggas kill for no reason
Camo shorts with a ho-beater; all-black hoodie, I'm Grim Reaper
Look like it's time for spring cleanin', brand-new spankin' street sweeper
Been in the game, I'm knee-deep, I like good head, I like good reefer
All my niggas strapped and ready to set it off: Queen Latifah
Got a chopper with a drum, split Swishers with my thumb
Get money like Donald Trump, double-barrel on that pump
This kush I got ain't no chump, get stupid and get stomped
Two guns, I call 'em ""Kris Kross""; Kris Kross'll make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do, got goons, I ain't even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool, I like my bitches in twos
Gotta go, I stick it and move, G-code, I stick to the rules
Last night I got so high, I swear to God, I went to the moon
I'm on that shit you can't get nowhere—you pussy, boy, don't go there
If I don't do nothin' I'ma ball: no hair
Smokin' on that ""Oh yeah,"" my niggas tote that hardware
What you 'bout, whoadie? My niggas 'bout that warfare
Real nigga since day one, 'cause I ain't promised day two
Throw that pussy at me, bitch, I think I'm Babe Ruth
Drop top Maybach on the way, yeah, that's that new Landaulet
She let me into her jungle, I'm gonna hit her with that rattlesnake
Guns clap like patty-cake, Blood gang red bandana face
Make them pussies pop they self, you can call that masturbate
I don't front, don't fabricate, I get high, I gravitate

Better run like Forrest Gump, fuck you and where you from

Sorry for the wait, man
Album coming August 29th, though
Tez made me do this song

[Verse]
Ain’t nobody fuckin' with me
First-degree murder, you can get your degree, motherfucker
And you ain’t gotta wonder about me, Wonder Woman
Tune gon' ball, money tall, Paul Bunyan
Real nigga shit, pussy niggas gon' hate
Pound of the kush, call that bitch ""pound cake""
I hit it from the back and make that bitch about-face
And then I gotta split, sorry, baby, sour grapes
She whine, ""Baby, don't leave""
I duck that bullshit, bob and weave
Everybody trippin', but I ain’t never trippin'
Leave your ass flatter than my new television
I'm talkin' 'bout money and the power, power and the money
This shit is magic: Stan Van Gundy
I'ma run this shit 'til I'm the last man runnin'
Mack, light that shit, then pass that to me
Young Money, motherfucker, yeah, we that shit
Yeah, Weezy go hard like Cialis
Don't love that bitch, I fucked that ho
She pop X; I smoke O’s—tic-tac-toe
And I stink, 'cause I got a lot of shit on my mind
They say numbers don't lie—is that a 6 or a 9?
I stand in front of the clock, 'cause I'm ahead of the time
Knock your pussy ass off and send your head to your mom
I ain’t playin' with niggas, no, sir, not me
And they can’t blindfold what my third eye see
Yeah, I was locked up, but like a bird, I'm free
And the coupe transform, no Tyrese
Hello, goodbye, where are you, Wayne?
I’m somewhere in between joy and pain
And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground
Now, ain’t that 'bout a bitch? It ain’t never 'bout a bitch
I'll take your bitch and make her everybody bitch
Backed up by a bunch of G-ass niggas
And I just bought your girlfriend some kneepads, nigga
Ha, Eagle Street, where the real niggas hung
I'ma rep that shit 'til kingdom come
Yeah, $hort bring the drank, I bring the blunts
Fuckin' with me, it's blood, brains or guts, argh!
Fuck y'all, for real, though
Sleep with the hammer under the pillow
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I’m done, peel off like velcro
Gone, baby, I'm stoned
Smokin' on the strong, got a huge-ass bong
Swag off the hook, you can’t use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on
Haha, one time for the G’s
The niggas got it locked, the niggas with the keys
The niggas on the block, the niggas on they P’s and Q’s
Put your bitch-ass on the evenin' news
Jumpin' in the game, better read the rules
High as a bitch, yeah, that's me on the moon
Fuck with me, die soon, not late
And I'm sorry for the motherfuckin' wait—Tunechi!See Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like21Embed"

I pop some Percocets
Then I pop some Xanax
Sitting back strapped, cocked
Plotting on your man next
Jack a nigga for his work
Then stretch it like some Spandex
He hesitate, I spray and leave him
Like a Tampex - oops, I meant a Tampax
Bitch, I keep that anthrax
I can get your man wacked for a couple tan packs
Shoot off your Sedan Lac
Nigga, I demand stacks
I ain't playing black
Bitch, I be spraying Macks
All type of guns with accessories
I'm like Cosby for the bills
I need mills like Stephanie
Pussy niggas can't stand next to me
I've got dope and ecstasy
Keep em floating like both of the levees breached
Eighties baby but my soul from the seventies
Worldwide game like a traveled the seven seas
Niggas ain't OG, scary lil bitch, please
Put your pussy in the pan, Friskies

I got ten up on my pinky ring and twenty on my bracelet
Now these niggas kissing ass, but they can't say shit
I'm just here to separate
The real from the fake shit
I told you, I was coming in
I'm sorry for the wait
I gotta get this money man
It's right here in my face
I got the Devil on my back
I don't wanna be up in that place
My grandmom tell me to be safe
I just keep running in these streets
I can't stop fucking with these hoes
When I say I'm just doing me
Bitch, I'm a Ninth Ward nigga
Mason street, D & G
That Florida right by the D
Need to free my nigga B
I ain't the type of person to be
Running from no beef, those fucking guns
Are gonna be bursting, knock somebody
Off their feet
So watch your fucking mouth
Before you end up on that floor and stop
Acting like you're hard cause
You know you've been a ho
I told you out the gate I'm not the fake
I gotta say, please excuse
Almost forgot man, I'm Raw Dizzy by the way
[Verse 3: Flow]
Money over bitches, bitch I'm coming for the check
Vampire living, bitch I'm coming for your neck
Raw, I'm sharp, my swagger like an X
I'm a motherfucking monster, I rap like I'm possessed
Call me Mr. Still Smoking, smoke it in a paper
The game is a bitch, hold that down and rape her
Yes I am a Blood but I be riding with my skaters
We probably smoking flavors bumping Tyler, the Creator
I'm an Eastside native, all my niggas Soo Woop'n
They went brazy when they heard I had a song with Lil Tunechi
Bitch, get some ice and pour my Sprite
And light my bong and my doobies
Fuck your producer, I'm the one who be
Producing my music
I'm a hippie surrounded by a lot of pot
Cock the semi
Drop you like an Otterbox
They sleeping on me like I'm rapping with a blanket
Kill a nigga, have him thinking that he planking

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
All-red plaid shirt, skinny ass jeans on
Them goons at your front door, choppers out: ""ding dong""
Didn't I change the game and put my motherfucking team on
Now let my chopper ring, blaka is my ringtone
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes
We hold court with them heaters, pop case open/closed
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed Oreos
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic's clothes
Ask them bitches, I told em hoes
They back it up like Sonny drive in Bronx Tale, Calogero
Lighter in my pocket, light the sky rocket
Pull them hammers out and run them nigga's like stockings
Got some niggas from my city

That's because you throw a 5, I pitch a 10
Now she wanna get inside of me 66
She see my wrist is blue and yellow like Michigan
She say she love her man, she misses him
But nobody do it better than her distance dick, me
I'm her long distance pimp
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip, yup
And I don't lie I confess
I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress
Gotta dress to impress though
Gotta stay clean, plus mami in a Lex 4
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death

So ride to it, y'all, vibe to it, y'all, damn

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, Mix done hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'ma paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one
See, you fucking with the boy who tote toys way before Christmas
No assistance just that persistence with that commitment if
I don't get it, somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right, then let me die in this song
See, I be ridin', just ridin' alone
With my daddy on my mind like, ""You gotta be kidding""
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear, but no emotions from a king
Shall be, so I be who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'
So I be who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'

My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord

[Verse 2]
Money is the motivation, facing the avenue
Back touching the wall, got the weed, got the gun
Gotta run when I hear the bird call (Brr), damn (Brr)
Hop in that thing and murk off, swerve off
You know me, they call me Birdman Junior (Ah-ah)
Anybody murderer if Birdman sponsor it (For sure, nigga, get you, you heard?)
Phantom of the Opera, all black, guap tint, locked in
I can let them shots out, you can't get no shots in
Bulletproof, leave a nigga with a bullet-roof
Shoot ya in your mouth, Leroy, they call him bullet-tooth
I'm like, ""What it do? What it do?""
There's a full court pressure, I'm just goin' for the two
If I'm open for the three, I'ma take it in a second
Even if there's one second, I'ma make it, it's nothin'
I don't take it for granted, I don't take it for nothin'
I take it for what it's worth to the dirt, motherfucker, yeah

[Verse 3]
I ain't never killed nobody, I promise
And I promise if you try me, he gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back, that thing'll go rrat
That boy'll lay flat, so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm and I'm masturbating
Black Peter Pan, fly 'til I die, what you sayin'?
Bathing Ape, Yves Saint, Evisu what I stay in
Got me feeling like Scarface, light the Cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four-seater
You know I be out here right in a four-seater
Top floor of the Four Seasons
Four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch, bundle up
See, it's a cold world, so homie, bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothin', now get your hustle up

Bangladesh
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derrière
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch, haha
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour, haha
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ahem
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish, ha!

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side
Bitch, I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together

See, I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

I point it at you and tell that motherfucker, ""Fetch""
I'm fuckin' her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth, and ass, call that bitch triple-threat
When I was in jail, she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset
Been fucking the world, and nigga, I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch, I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

I'm not a star, somebody lied

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""

You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around

'Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin' the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing

Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit

Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough  guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos

""Knock, knock. Who's there?"" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so

We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him"" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothing, keep resting,""
She say, ""What's missing?""—""How you know something missing?""
He scratched his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,""
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, ""Ooh""

Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,""
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware

Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me a salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier!""
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
For a minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself

She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,""

Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)

Can we talk about it now?
I mean the little trouble that we've been having lately
You know, I really— I really mean—
I really can’t stand the way, you know
That we're acting toward each other
It's just not right, you know

[Verse 1]
Ahem, yeah, they love me when the mic on
But then they show my dark side when the lights on
But fuck ’em in the ass with a pipe, homes
Fuck off and let me get my life on
You crackerjack, get your white on
I will send niggas to your house whilе your wife home
I'm Black and proud, right on
And since thеse lights on, let me get my bright on
Don't worry 'bout what I'm on
I own everything around me, now get the fuck from 'round me
I should pull out my dick and watch you climb on
Get the fuck up out my hair unless you're my comb
That mean mind yours because I'm grown
And I’ma die alone with my Styrofoam

I hope you can dig what I’m saying now
And please don't get mad (Uh)

Like, get the fuck outta my business
’Cause I've been handling the fuck outta my business
Grinding, got perfect attendance
Flyer than first-class and detention
Uh, been a winner since a beginner
And my records show, now leave it in the Guinness
What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started
Put you on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, newborn baby, and it's my party
And I’m kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrari
Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
I'm open for criticism
But really, is it any room for criticism? When the shit that's in 'em
Is deeper than your pool, so I swim in toilets
Bitch, I be and I been ballin', yeah

[Refrain]
I hope you can dig what I'm saying now (Uh)
And please don't get mad

[Verse 3]
And now I'm back like spinal, attack like rhino
Got the thunder like Lion-O and leave your head spinning like vinyl
I know, psycho but tight, though
Right, ho? But you could drown in my flow 'cause my flow is a tidal
Wave, you gon' need Geico or gecko
I go get from the get-go, go let
Let go, let's go, go where? Anywhere but nowhere
Colder than a polar bear's toenail
No frail, don't break, too real
Boy, I get it poppin' like New Year's
Scream ""Hallelujah"", I am the one, call me new year
My car windows dark and my diamond chains too clear
Like a light blink, bitch, I wear a ice rink
Syrup pink, that ice pink, pour it up for Pimp C
Pour it up for Screw and Moe, pour it up for Bun B
Pour it up for young me, nigga

Ayy, the blues is now kickin', and dinner is three Michelin
I don't eat red meat, but still got beef sizzlin'
Know that I need discipline
I keep singin' for all these hoes, they keep listenin'
Niggas love to bro up with the boy and dap fists-es
But we are not equivalent, dawg
I been an only child, don't need siblings
And I'm past them like the times that he's livin' in, okay
Man, if you saw what I flew here, you'd be like, ""He's sickenin'""
If you not runnin' some top, we not gon' keep kickin' it
Classics, I keep scribblin', lights in the Universal building just keep flickerin'
Money just keep comin' in, you would think I'm Irish the way that it stays doublin'
I could feed a country with the tax that I pay governments
Whatеver they're doin' with my cash is vеry troublin'
Okay, February came around, I used to get paid shovelin'
Sold clothes, walked dogs, trust me, I stay hustlin'
When it came to school, there's no way that I'm A-plus-in' it
So I just dropped out of it, trust me, I'm not proud of it
Niggas get too comfy in they spot, they get knocked out of it
Niggas get a gun just so they can make props out of it
Shawty make a scene in the house, she get locked out of it
Yeah, you not 'bout to be chillin' in this bitch with kicked feet up
I'ma make you bounce out this ho like Big Freedia
Pete O. used to throw a purple tint on a two-liter
First private plane I ever rode was a eight-seater
Before that, I got the bedroom hot with a space heater
On top of that, I didn't have shit to my name either, that's real
But now I'm givin' house tours 'til it's back to world tours
Play that ""Mask Off"" when they find the real cure
I might not be good for her, but I'm real to her
Got no time for her, but give Richard Mille to her
That's the only way I know how to express love
My dawgs love sticks and drums like they Questlove
All them jokes about Aubrey, they got me messed up, for real
I come with a lot of complications inside me
It's always people misleadin' me that are tryna guide me
Everyone wants to try me, but no one wants to buy me
Everyone wants to meet me, but no one wants to keep me
Everyone talkin' lemons when everything is peachy
Everyone got they hands out, and it ain't to reach me

Mhm, yeah, mhm
Everyone got they glass out, let's drink to Weezy
Every nigga that stare me down just came to see me
Choppin' up a lil' cash cow, that's steak I'm eatin'
Check deposits, high-risers with extra closets
The sex platonic, I talk intelligent, text Ebonics
The electronic guitars whinin', that's just Nirvana
Tommy gun on the counter, I call it Mr. Thomas
That'll keep niggas honest
I'm dozin' off in the driver seat 'cause the seat give massages
Decimal point money, these numbers too steep for commas
I'm eye to eye with niggas, I can't help but to see beyond 'em
Got a two-seater problem
Niggas thinkin' they cold, I knock the flu-season out 'em
Bitches forget they hoes, and that's when Tunechi remind 'em
I used to fuck Gucci models, I'm fuckin' Gucci designers
I keep it too G regardless, I'm gettin' too deep for divers
Let me resurface, I'm flexin' on purpose
She especially curvy, bet she be servin' every purpose, perfect
I'm better than perfect, I'm sick, I need to see a medical person
Eatin' all of these rappers with these edible verses
All I gotta be is all that I can possibly
She really, really into me, then suck it all up out of me
I'm proud of me, I don't know how to be sorry, apologies
You fuckin' with my math, you better know some trigonometry
'Cause I'ma be bustin', leave your lima bean at your mama feet
I flip the economy like Dominique Dawes
They say I'm trippin', I guess they wishin' I finally fall
I don't need war, I need a bitch that know I'ma need yours
I'ma need more, niggas is shifty like Honda Accords
Fire alarm, ain't got no ceilings, we climbin' the walls
Higher than yours, I fuck your bitch and she die in my arms

Make me have my skaters skate over to your place soldier
You a play soldier, you a snakе, you a fake cobra
You ain't safe, have thе safe open, I need payola
On yo' knees, nigga where the keys? I'm like Beethoven
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, a pen to a test
I bring the night to his sunlight and zen to her stress
I bring the gun to a fist fight, the dick to her breast
She want the cum on her tongue like it's mint to her breath
This is grown man BI, R.I.P B.I
Nigga, you might be a CI, talkin' to the FBI
Big beast to the east-side, now she's on my G5
Fuck on her to some C5, cut on Funeral and she die

You ain't been in the throne
'Cause the seat ain't warm enough

Don't let me do it to him Dunie 'cause I overdo it

His stylist split his wig for me if I told her do it
We hit his crib and broke into it, if it's smoke, we blew it
We don't believe you, you need more people
Ain't shit sweet, boy, you need more Equal
You ain't runnin' shit, boy, feed your Ezekiel

Don't let em gas you, like Tunechi reading Thrasher
He won't thrash you 'cause I'll be glad to split your apple, I had to
Stab you, chop you up in the bathroom so casual
Then drop you off in front of a chapel with candles
Detach you, body from soul
Anita Baker body and soul, come out of my soul
I made a way to the rockiest roads and highway patrol
Full speed ahead clean the bread from the sloppiest joes
I got it in the hot and the cold, the mud in the rain
I stomach the pain, got more bloods than the blood in my veins

Don't get me wrong, bitch get me right
Don't blow up my phone, no dynamite
She give me them jaws, that shark don't bite
Pussy I eat, don't feed me lies
She say that she gay, I say ""hooray"" (Yeah)
You just my type (Yeah), I love them dykes (Yeah)
I'm on a pill, she done some white (Shit)
Her Tongue was red, yeah, I run the light (Nyum)

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
IG, TikTok, nope, she say she saw me on Triller, yeah
Squad up, squadzilla, yeah
Throw a three hundred thou' out the window, yeah, uh
I'm rich but I'm slimy, go low on lil' mami
I look up, and she say she finna cum
I say ""Yeah, I know,"" she say ""Please take it slow""
And I hit her with the E-40 flow
This triple X-Rated, that triple-stacked ecstacy pill make her cum 'til she come undone
She put coke on my dick and her tongue get numb
She too numb to talk shit, she can't pump her gums
I flew to Paris just to say ""bonjour""
Flew to Amsterdam just to smoke the good
Flew to Napa Valley just to taste the grapes
Flew to H-Town just to get an eight
I got the industry wanna be me
The same imagery, all I see is lil' me
I'm in the Rolls Royce with her doonies
Dripping all this milkshake on them Kelis
Like bling in the light
She wanna fuck on the king, not a knight
I pick her up, put her feet in the sky
When we fuck, sound like Tina and Ike
I put some cum in her drink, now it's spiked
She 'bout to drink it like white wine
Can't cry over spilled milk, but that cum look like milk in her mouth
If she spill it, I might cry
Pop the coco, some Rosé, Dom Pérignon
I pull up with a hoe out a catalogue
Drop her off then go pick up her famo
Knock her off, take her shit, then I vamos
Gucci links from the rocks as a choker
Matching bracelet and watch, I'm supposed to
R.I.P. to the Pop, make me smoke ya
S-A-P for the opp, buenos noches
M-O-B to the mob, cosa nostra
L-I-T and I'm high as the voltage
Extra lean, extra pot, extra dosage
Extra cream in the crop, that's the potion
Extra clips, extra shots at your soldiers
Seventeen in the Glock, no emotion
Extra bang, extra pop and explosion
Turn his body to ash, he need lotion
The clock always wrong but I'm right on time

Working while they sleeping as usual

These niggas think they passed up, they think too much
If these niggas get too gassed up, I bring a few pumps
Yeah, Hershey chocolate candy skin, she ate all my nuts
Yeah, wifey caught me slipping once, okay, more than once
Yeah, we don't hit your block up, we blow that bitch up
Cappin', talkin' big shit until that shit don't flush
Yeah, they say my days are numbered, but I keep taking drugs
Baby, I know you see these X pills, pleasе take one
I'm a skater but I hеard your man a cheapskate, huh
Heard he rattin', now they moving his release date, huh, snitch
I just turned my main to my spouse
Could've bought her ass the tote purse or pouch, bought a house
Now baby got an ego twice the size of the crib
Now she see what I'm saying, she got eyes in her ears
Never turn your back on Weezy F B, God forbid
I might have to do a bid if she left me, I forgive
Twerkin', got a fatty in this bitch, doing butt flips
Way she roll her hips make her body look like Sunchips
Working out my demons, that's beautiful
And bae off of that riesling, she super loose
I'm smokin', she say pass it, she doing too much
Haven't done my taxes, fuckin' with Trump
She brought her skirt without the panties with the slit going up

Young Mula, baby

[Verse 1: Euro]
I belong to the world, don't be selfish with me
When I go places with Wayne, you would think Elvis with me
My niggas livin' in Hell, they thinkin' Heaven sent me
When she scream, ""Fuck love,"" I think she meant me
I get in the zone, applyin' pressure
You get the message, only I ain't text ya
Y'all like to gamble with life, you lucky I ain't bet ya
So you survived a few cats, don't let a lion get ya
If I ain't met ya, I ain't ever move ya
If there's a new year then I never knew ya
Look, my junior gon' have a future
And my senior gotta drive a Beamer
I wish my dawgs could turn they felonies to misdemeanors
Ayy, 'cause I met a girl with features out in Italy
Wish they had seen her
Shoulda took a picture, I packed condoms
I shoulda packed a book with scriptures
Put me in the Rock Hall of Fame with all the suicidal niggas, iconic figures
If rivals come for us, then they comin' with us
Tell 'em, ""Run, Forrest,"" run for the fame, runnin' with us
What's one life to a hunnid killas?
All you heard was loud sirens and lighter flickers

I made a mill' right after breakfast, that's a power lunch
I fuck your bitch for 'bout a hour, that's a power fuck
I fuck your bitch up in the shower, that's a shower fuck
I fuck your bitch and now she pregnant, shit, we outta luck
HoodyBaby, Master P's 'boutta 'boutta buck
I been slackin', Major Bass, I could battle up
Picture me somewhere tropic, prolly mad as fuck
But I'm cool, body language break the barrier
Broken bitches wishin' that I fix her up and carry her
I was out in Italy, Roman like my carrier
I done lost hoes, turned around, I done lost bros
I just got ghost, hit a nigga with the Death Star

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Dear Heavenly Father, is there a church in the wild?
For the fugitives that I harbor
Yeah, we move like a mile, my op'll send out the orders
Got some people in Texas, their crib is right by the border
Place your order for cola, ain't talkin' pop like soda
Vacuum seal all the packages, tryna drown out the odor
No weapons formed against me shall prosper
The streets praise us like gospel
So we move and we roam like them Italian mobsters
Practice the code of silence, omérta
So ain't no talkin', we lurkin'
Find the strip where you workin'
Closed curtains, fear no man but God
Now they callin' me Lord
I pray on the sinners when bald palms touchin' like an applause
Synagogue is like the Pentagon, arms cover my flaws
Quiet storm but lion-hearted, I wake up with a roar
Call me the clean up, man, I sweep shit up like a chore
Then sweep your chick off her feet, put her in my stable of whores
Mentally stable, not sure, screws loose, shake to the floor
Breakin' records on the radio while breakin' the law
I keep my faith in the Lord, one day I'll make it to Forbes
[LAT] them thieves is comin', and what we takin' is yours
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Look, I'm not worthy of your controversy
I'm not thirsty, baby, I'm allergic
Giddy up, dick ridin', swervin'
Yeehaw, that's Kentucky Derby
I remember lyin' on the gurney
Thinkin' how I'ma die early
Never thought that I'd see thirty
Oh, the journey, had to fuckin' earn it
I go back in time when I was flirtin'
That time that I was flirtin' with uncertain
Never thought I'd be surrounded by
Housekeepers, chauffeurs, chefs and servants
Diamonds screamin', ""Oh my lovely God""
Sippin' syrup, watchin' out for serpents
Touch my surface, then it's closed curtains
Oh my God, you're meetin' God in person
Oh my God, I want the squad alerted
And I come from it, they hop up like Kermit
Corner turnin' with marijuana burnin'
In the trunk, you squirmin', now here come to sermons
Oh my God, every thot a burden
I ain't worry, got her ridin' dirty
Trap house poppin' like it's Pee Wee Herman's
The plug alerted, now the socket workin'
Other niggas catchin' power surges
I'm determined just like my attorney
You other niggas, you ain't got attorneys
Order new trap house, I buy it furnished
I been listenin', listenin' to the money
It been tellin', tellin' me, ""It's comin'""
Soundin' like music to my ears
Soundin' like a symphony of hundreds
Grandma always said that I'd be special
Mama always said that I'd be somethin'
I had to make sure that they wasn't guessin'
So I made the most out of they assumptions
Bein' careful 'round my pistol
Nigga all up in a bimbo
Bein' everything but simple
Got my deal without a demo, Tunechi

Okay, Comme Des Garçons and some new Saint Laurent
I mix Gianni Versace with Coco Chanel
I throw on some Fendi, a mink when it's windy
Too cold for the Devil, I'm snowin' in Hell
Skatin' on marble, I flow in thin air
I'm dancin' on water, tip-toein' on nails
Can't walk in my shoes, can't roll in my wheels
Can't order my food, you throw up that meal
Can't do what I do, you can't do me
Yeah, I would not try to do you, I'm too me
Look at my sons' faces, I see the new me
I look into they face and I see the beauty
I take a vacation and go see some beautiful shit
Come back with a whole different view of this shit
My third eye just opened 'cause two wasn't shit
It's either that or too many hallucinogens
Got a cute-ass lil' bitch with a coke habit
That lil' bitch at my crib 'til the snow cappin'
When we fuck, man, that shit make her go faster
She so numb, man, that bitch ain't got no passion
Ain't no love in that bitch, ain't no romancin'
Ain't no love in that bitch, ain't got no magic
Ain't no judgin' that bitch 'cause we both addicts
She in love with this dick, it got gold status
Huh, Comme Des Garçons
I got that bread like a biscuit, a bun or croissant
Got the feds on my dizzick, they bustin' my balls
And she play with my dick, make me bust in my drawers
And I take off my Ethika, I'm gettin' naked
And she gettin' wet and now I'm gettin' erections
Oh, she say it spiritual when I have sex with her
I'm blessin' her, I think I pop too much ecs' with her
I fuck with my ex with her, you keep the rest of her
Don't care who left with her, I don't wan' F with her
Hop off that pedestal if you wan' leave
Then it was my pleasure, them thots is more pleasurable
I'm on my medical, smokin' my vegetable
Bro cut my revenue down to the decimal
Rollie, I stare at you, then I start tellin' you
How much I care for you, I diamond bezel you
Comme Des Garçons with that Yves Saint Laurent
I mix new CDG with some new YSL
I pop my trunk, how this new chopper feel?
All you get is ""buck-buck"" like a two-dollar bill
I'm so fucked up, they say, ""You gotta chill""
So-so fucked up, Tunechi, you're outta here
Raw in the cut, smokin' dope, poppin' pills
Since I'm goin' so nuts, I drip pure almond milk
Ugh, Comme Des Garçons, fuck what they all say
Nigga, fuck what they done, I give a fuck what they on
I run in your place, like, ""Honey, I'm home,"" like, ""Honey, I'm wrong""
'Cause I tell you, ""I love you,"" and honey, I don't
Got too many girlfriends, got too many girlfriends, one in my trunk
Ooh, money, I flaunt, ooh, money, I flaunt
I spend money on war, which one of y'all want war?
None of y'all want war, that's what the fuck l thought
Fuck you thought, I drop a contract on your heart
Give a fuck what that cost, suffer that loss
Stuffed in that box and dumped in that park

Hit a nigga dead in the chest, like Saquon with the stiff arm
Damn, I'm thinkin' drive bys (Yeah, yeah), yeah

I'm on your block with money on top

I'm spittin' this fire, I do not expire
Just pass me the lighter and we not gon' stop
They callin' me Freddy, you know I'm the Krueger
Teachin' these classes like I am a tutor
Got too much girls, I'm callin' them hooters
Kobe, number eight
Most of these girls, they just want the fame
If he just want money then get out my lane (Ching, ching)
These vibes are so crazy, I'm goin' insane
I pull up to school and you know I ain't late
They call me ""Lil' psychic,"" got medium fade
I see that you're nervous, I see it in your face
They call me ""Almighty,"" you cannot escape
You cannot escape, you cannot escape (Nope)
Just got a new 'Rari and bought a new Lambo (Skrrt)
Watchin' a movie but it is not Rambo
Killin' this beat, I know you a fan, bro
I know you a fan, bro
I'm not Chinese but pull up with chop-sticks
I'm like La Flame, I'm bringing the mosh pits
I am the villain, no reason to stop this
No reason to stop this
I don't want 'rona but pull up with soap (Corona)
I am so great that they call me the G.O.A.T
I pray to God that I get a blessing
I am young grinder, no need for resting

Might be the Giuseppes
Bitch, you could get left, so bitch, get me right
You gotta impress me
Lil' bitch walking 'round with her titties out
Like she gon' breastfeed
Police raiding my spot
They saw it was me and took selfies
Play with them guns
Soon as they pop I'm gon' hit my target
In front of his broad, in front of his daughters
I'm so remorseless
We in Miami in the middle of a pandemic
And we on a new beach
Working that salmon, runnin' that sushi
I cannot mention my hoes inside of my songs
'Cause I know they be bragging a lot
I can't keep these pills, getting high with these bitches
I'm supposed to be handing 'em out
Show me that nigga who say he getting rich off of dope
'Cause my niggas be jabbing a lot
I heard that you and them niggas you with ain't no joke
My niggas laughing out loud, yeah
That shit was awesome, took her to Nordstroms
Just had a foursome, didn't have to force 'em
You cannot come back around me
You turn your back on me, I cannot forgive
You need to stop fucking with strippers
Tou run into agents and giving 'em tips
We kill your slime, we take your work
We take your bitch, you a bitch
My bitch is a snob, my fool is a jerk
And I bet this missile don't miss

Shorty might got a pole but won't pop shit
He be talking like he down to drop shit
Bitch I'm up in your crib and I don't got a key
I be all in yo shit like a locksmith (Get em)
And we ain't throwing hands, better stop it
You ain't see no white flag when we squash shit (Nah)
And you know what's gon' happen when Tune put me right on a track
Bitch, you know that's the squad shit
Heard your funds just got low, ain't no job, nigga
So you out here, and you bout to starve nigga
I was in your position, and back in the day, I was all by myself, I would rob niggas
Now my money up, I'm living large, nigga
Ain't no need to relive in the dark, nigga
Now I'm 'bout to skrrt off of the lot in the Bentley
And take up two spots when I park, nigga (Skrt)
Man, these niggas be boasting
I don't even drink on the liquor
'Cause when I skate, bitch, I need focus
No comedian joking, man
I hope he get his ass right on the stand so my youngins can roast him
Man, you know why I'm chosen, 'cause I ran here first in the game, put my foot down 'til that bitch was choking
This shit be promotion 'cause I'm smoking on this good kush, bitch, and it's potent

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Lean, water, intelligence, nigga finding your medicine
My weapons will knock an ottoman out of your residence
Got your wife on the edible, secret service
And she taking it down like the president
Can't survive in my element
If you never been in stride with the lions and elephants
When they free all my niggas then wherever Weezy be
Where I'm flying the felons in (Yup)
They be rhyming so predicate
Then, when you see 'em in person, they quiet and delicate
And 'til somebody die for the death of your brethren
I cannot buy what you selling in
We met at the Mandalay she live in San Jose
Visiting town with a friend today
When they hop in the Laundaulet
We 'bout to fuck over mandolins, champagne and creme brulée
Tell your little mans to stay in his place
Don't wanna get shot in your shin today
Nigga play on the internet, I don't get into that
I send a shot in your shin today
Way too many niggas and not enough bitches for all of this bitch shit
Too many to name, you know who to call
For real, some pimp shit
What you saying is not realistic
I just left Elliante the district
But I still go to Vice with the biscuit
Even still for a slice and I missed it
'Bout to gamble your life on a trip bitch
I be rolling the dice on on her lipstick
I'm a different type of sadistic
I don't look at the price when I get shit
I don't put in no ice when I sip shit
Lot of boomers and lights when I clip shit
Leave the room looking like I just flipped shit
She be riding me like I'm a ripstick
She say she want a body for Christmas
I'm living like some bucket list shit
If you don't like it suck a sick dick1Embed"

Baby I'm yours 'til I cut the umbilical, gone

Girl, you know...
Girl, you know I fuckin' love you
That’s on God, on his son too
But you be actin' like it's untrue
But you be actin’—cut!

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I fuckin' love you
So why you actin' like it's just you?
Girl, you know we never rumble
But don't make me get someone to jump you
'Cause you be actin'
Actin' funny when your hair fixed
Actin’ funny, I ain’t laughin'
Get your pussy, not your ass kissed

[Chorus]
Ooh, but my pool so big, got a yacht in it
And the yacht so big, got a pool on it
But the house empty when you not in it
When I look up at the ceilin’, see the roof fallin'
My world so big but it stop spinnin'
My tears so big, it's a tsunami
Her pussy so good, got me short winded
So bad to me, so good for me
Pool so big, got a yacht in it
Yacht so big, got a pool on it
This house is not a home when you not in it
Got a new bitch with me, shе just spot fillin’
World so big but it stop spinnin'
Tears so big it's a tsunami

We don't make love no more
And when we do, it's not the same way
It's not the same way

[Pre-Chorus]

On God, on his son too
You be actin' like it's untrue
You be actin', cut

Actin' funny, I ain't laugh, bitch
You, get your pussy, not your ass kissed, oh

[Chorus]
Pool so big, got a yacht in it
Yacht so big, got a pool on it
House empty when you not in it
Look up at the ceilin', see the roof fallin'
My world so big but it stop spinnin'
Ask her what it is, she say, ""You callin'""
Pussy so good, I get short winded
So bad to me, so good for me
Pool so big, got a yacht in it
Yacht so big, got a pool on it
House not a home when you're not in it
Got a new bitch with me, she just spot fillin'

Three, uh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm bout to shoot at a nigga, no layup
I pull up and step back and I get my J up, yea
Point-blank, I shoot at a nigga
Or shoot at her nigga from far like I'm Trae Young
Shoot at a nigga, no airball, ooh
Shoot at a nigga, no backboard
I break a full court press up at half-court
That's no cap like an afro

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I swing that stick like Wayne Gretzky
I keep a K on me like I'm Coach K, Mike Krzyzewski
Hope you set tripping, then I gotta send shots
Get your whole set shot, quiet on the set bitch
Shoot at a nigga, no bank shot
Check the game clock, nigga, time is too precious
I shoot at a nigga, no rebound
Shoot the whole team down, rookies and veterans
She give me face time, no texting
She give me face through the zipper, bow
Open face, Tunechi got shooters like Golden State
Shoot at a nigga, no dribble, no handle
Shoot at a nigga, no dribble, no travel
Shoot at a nigga, no Euro-step
Still have my dribble, ain't using my pivot yet
Aim at his rim, and I hit the net
Shoot at the cheerleaders, blood on the pom-poms
Shoot your coach up, shoot the sidelines
Court side seats, get blood on the popcorn
Shoot you like Jordan, like Bron-Bron
Shoot at a nigga like Harden from the outside
Nigga can't guard, can't block mine
Shoot at a nigga, going hard from the foul line
Heater on call, it's a hotline
Shoot at a nigga, no double-dribble
Shoot at a nigga, no crossover
Driveway looking like a toy store
I'ma ball, I'ma never turn the ball over
I'ma shoot at a nigga, on Mula
Pull up with two hundred guns, it's a shootout
Shoot at a nigga, no hooping, no hoopla
Tunechi, lil nigga, No Ceilings, no rooftop
I'm 'bout to spray at that nigga, no drizzle
Get down and lay down lil nigga, no pillow
I light up a J on a nigga, no Leno
I'm slime everyday on a nigga, no schedule
All of these lil' niggas claiming they killas
Just holding up guns, taking pictures in the mirror
Pop me a seal, I pour a line and reseal it
Then I laugh at these niggas
Don't they look like my children?
Giggle, giggle, giggle, giggle
She lick it right after I bust—that shit tickle
She swallow a shot glass of nut like tequila
She like to talk when she fuck, I couldn't hear her
She like to walk on my rug, it's chinchilla
She wan' fuck on my rug, I say, ""Bitch, that's chinchilla""
She like to masturbate while on her period
Then suck her finger, I swear she the weirdest
My trigger finger, that's all with my blood
Used to party with bloods, now Hollywood drugs
Got bitches on drugs in the car waiting for us
Waiting on there to fuck and then all day we fucking
And all night we bucking, all white, the cups in it
Cocaine is soft, all white deluxe
And his head might come off and you might see his guts
And it might make you barf and the memory blush
Run it, run it
I can't keep up 'cause I might be on blow
And I might be on rush, yeah, I might be on slow
'Cause I might be on codeine and promethazine
This ain't minor league bruh, I need ice in my punchy
Put ice on my nuts, that be icy as fuck
I'll be icy icy, very pricey
I be so lit up they call me ""Chris Lighty""
You could get lit up just for some enlightment
Fuck the indictments
I fuck the crystal and I fuck the diamond
I fuck some swimmers, and I fuck some divers
Never been fishy, but I fuck the Pisces
I fuck the simple and I fuck the silent
I fuck the gentle and I fuck the kindly
I fuck the physical, I fuck the violent
Then I fuck the mental and I fuck the body

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Five white girls but they not Spice Girls
Just some hot girls who like to snort white girl
I'm in a all black coupe likе Dark Knight, girl
These herе Jimmy Choos, not Off-Whites, girl
Five AKs and they pop, NSYNC
Got five lil' baes and they pop and drink
If it's not bright pink then it's not my drink
These bright white links make your eyesight weak
Runnin' through a bag like YouTube money
New Orleans nigga, got beaucoup money
I voodoo somethin', I wish you would do somethin'
Milkin' this shit like the Yoo-Hoo bunny
Got the private plane lit and the Bluetooth runnin'
Tunechi gon' spit like a new tooth comin'
Everybody 5 like the FUBU company
Whole bunch of zeros like a new bag of Funyuns
Tunechi got shottas like Buju Banton
Bullets that'll shoot through mountains
Talkin' that shit and I Doo Doo Brown 'em
I punish these boys, I ground 'em
Yeah, and these funny ass boys, I clowned 'em
I'm laughin' so hard, laugh louder
Yeah, Young Money so raw, no condom
No teeth, just jaws, just tonsils
Fuck everything that they say about me
I done fucked every bad bitch that stay on South Beach
Money talk, mine just gave a nice speech
Just laid a bitch down like Laila Ali
Sittin' in the throne, tryna stay in my seat
It cost to be the boss, bitch payin' my fee
Only smoke blunts, give the J to wifey
Every now and then, I might hit the J like Kyrie
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tatted up and say that they GOATs, just like me
If I inspired you, that's so inspirin'
That Nina work for me, that ho can get fired
Golf Wang Converse, I'm Lil Tyler
Might skate in 'em, might not even rock 'em
Bad bitch, nice top, nice bottom
Fuck her with my chains on, she melt the ice out 'em
Superstar shit, smellin' like roses
Superstar dick, spread it like COVID
Flag red as fuck but I'm golden
Casket lit, was up and I closed it
Opp dead, this Hell and I'm Satan
Thousand bullet shells, yeah I'm blatant
No Ceilings, she's stargazin'
Dead presidents, reincarnated
Tyler Herro, workin' on my jumper
I need a shero, fuckin' Wonder Woman
No Ceilings, third times a charm
Nigga, I don't fuck with you like Big Sean

Fuck with Tune, your tomb get carved in stone
Just like statues of me when I'm gone
Artists, yeah, artillery get drawn
Boy I goes in like outside was a storm
Upgraded, this ain't even my final form
Can't say you ain't been warned, you ain't on what I've been on
I live and breathe and die by this lifestyle shit
It just don't sit on my charm
Take my kindness for weakness then you not strong
Whole city remind me when I'm gone
When I was down bad, I didn't complain
I was at the bottom right where I belong
If you don't climb to the top, you're not as strong
Weezy, that's my twin but we both one of one
I can teach you how to get it one on one
When you ball like this, ho it's not a game
But I'm goin' insane all '21
Bitch think we dated off a one-and-done
And the human race, if it's not a race
It's a quest, a journey, but I'm fuckin' facin'
All the problems that I keep on runnin' from
Got a hitlist, checklist, to-do list, guest list
Super bad bitch list, I don't need a wish list
I'm already gifted, I'm done giving forgiveness
The ones that hate me the most ain't nothin' like me
I could never hate nobody I ain't met or seen
Bluegrass girl, ever since I cut her down
She been havin' wetter dreams, drop the mic, let her sing
I've been ready for the war and whatever that'll bring
From where niggas don't engage and they still let it ring (Brr)
Got back up with me and we movin' in sync
Got killer instincts but I spit that vaccine
I'm only hittin' raw if I hit a couple times
Already with the rubber and the shit didn't stink
Had a chain, gave my brothers, we forever in a link
Gonna roll on the world, let's travel
Well you gotta pay a toll, hmm-hmm, yeah, whatever that means
Weezy said, ""Kill 'em man, fuck all that booty shit""
I’m on that brutal shit
When I say next year is our year, ho, watch what we do to it
Ten plus in and I can't let go
Just like my girl doin' stupid shit
This a lot of y'all that owe me a check, respect and publishing
Yeah, a whole slew and shit
I'm in euphoria with a young thing and she poppin' like Rue and shit
Me and Weezy beat the beat like we Ken and Ryu and shit
I used to hesitate, took my heart
Told my head, ""Lil bitch quit playin' and do this shit""
When you on like this
Every bad bitch come around with ass and titties
Need that double R when you go rags to riches
Need some R&R but now we back to bid'ness, lil' bitch
Yeah, lil' fuckin' bitch

Go to war for these hoes, that's lunacy
I done lost all control of the goon in me
Chopper spark like it's electrocuting me

Tired of these strippers, I'm going at nurses
She write me prescriptions, she light up medicinal
The conditional critical, might need a physical
Cold as a hospital, warm and hospitable
Tommy gun extendo long as a tentacle
I got this octopus on me, it swim with you
I bring apocalypse straight to your living room
Tony the Tiger, you flaky, you cereal
My life a movie, get head underwater
We fuck in my pool, that's chlorine in her pussy
Codeine make the drank bubble like a jacuzzi
Codeine make it pink, something like a petunia
My baby whip faster than mine, she splurging
My baby sip glasses of wine, sip yurple
Take off that mask, bae, your smile don't deserve it
Take her to Belgium for waffles and syrup
Might take her to Paris to buy a few Birkins
They tryna put me in the can, she nervous
Bae Ima man I don’t mind I’ll serve it, just pray for your man pray your honor have mercy
She never leave me, she so down
She hang with actresses, don't even go out
I'm changing my status, I'm changing my profile
Changing my addy, I'm changing my doorknobs

Pour me some actavis, I watch it pour down
I drip every day just to stay in my own house

Cullinan foggy, I'm smoking the loggy
I'm too high to argue, I'm too rich to bargain
That pussy my target, I look at my target
That pussy get soggy, her legs are wide open
Her tongue out like Jordan, cum on my Rick Owens
And cum on my Jordans and now I'm tiptoeing all up in her garden
And now her clit sore, I'ma rub on it for her
No Ceiling, nigga, hey
All of my hoes give facial, all of my hoes give fellatio
All of my hoes sensational, all of my hoes interracial
All of my hoes into gay shit, all of my hoes is persuasive
All of my hoes get a date, all of my hoes get 'em wasted
I be right there when you wake, and all of my hoes getting raises, Mula
She never leave me, she so down
I hang with capitalists, don't bring the broke 'round
This automatic a dummy a moron
I make it rain, clear it out like Boban
Run through the pack like inches on fourth down

Bustin' nuts, and she act like a squirrel on it, and my shit ain't never been bit
I get up in that pussy with passionate dick, she can never forget, this that elephant dick
Uh, go ahead, sit on it, I took my thumb out her ass, and had shit on it
I know she feel it all in her arteries, I paint her face like an artist
She smokin' on D like Marlboros, I need me a bitch with a twin like the Charlos
She lick on that tip till the tip is a hollow tip, fuck IG, let's make a porno flick
I like big pussy on somе soprano shit, monkey on this banana clip
Messy lil' clit, wettеst lil’ throat, hold on, hold on real quick
We have sex on the beach, go where nobody knows, we got sand on our feet and white sand on our nose
Two nights ago, came in you twice and more, you say you'd like some more, I know you nice and slow
Ooh, you a angel, swallow the cum and say, ""Thank you,"" I say, ""De nada, mi amore""
She wants some Topanga, let me get my dreads out the way, I'm a casket, put the pussy dead in my face
She pull the dick out while I'm sleeping, I'm having wet dreams, she forgot her bikini
Ooh, now she topless, but like Champagne Papi, I start from the bottom, I'm the pussy monster
Might not love her, so when I fuck her, I put both hands on her neck and remind her

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid & Lil Wayne]
Love the way you walk, love the way you talk (Talk)
All the bands on me like a broke gettin' a boss
She'll suck a bag hard but the dick goes soft
She just choked on a dick but a nigga dozed off (Dozed off)
Michael Jackson, how the diamonds dancin'
I'm the boss, wake up, make her buy a phantom
Say he rich forever, so they really can't stand him
Tell her, ""Suck the dick with two hands, I'm handsome""
When I pull up, take a bitch, ain't no ransom
He ain't dropped a hit, he ain't got no anthems (Woo)
It's a plain Patek, I won’t rock no ring
She just ran the money up, now they can't stand him
Might take a bitch to my momma spot (Momma spot)
She was a freaky, she licked me like lollipop
All this water on me, know that I keep a mop
All these cars, it's a G comin', flex a lot (No, Baby)
No babies, you better swallow them for me (For me)
On your knees (On your knees)
You had to pay, I got it free (Free)
All these diamonds on me kickin' like Bruce Lee (Yeah)

Now, the mula got her speakin'
I've speakin' for myself, I thought of usin' Robin Leach
I just bought Barbie a gift and it's an Uzi, got it pink
Should I teach her how to shoot it? She might take a shot at me
We some killers round this bitch, where it's kill or be killed
Prescription refill, pop a pill and be still
Not for nothin', for the most, we hold a toast at each meal
I can flip a Jae Mill to a fuckin' Meek Mill
Knock on wood, it might answer back when you this real
Fuck your bitch, told her, ""Hit me back whеn I clear here”
I could roll a blunt fastеr than your get your ears pierced
I'ma shoot your ass exactly where you get your ears pierced
Never seen a bigger ticket than this, little bitty nigga
New Orleans, burry me up in the middle of it, nigga
I've been peepin', I've been squintin' and I still can't see a limit
Higher than my limitations, and the fuckin' Himalayas
And I'm stuntin on my neighbors
And the blunt as long as cables
There’s some hundreds on the table
That was our paper towels
Left my number for the waitress
She was flirtin', I embraced it
Now I'm fuckin' her and the women I was on a date with
I'm a god among Satans, I'm the doc that lost patience
I went from the judge sentence to a fuckin' fashion statement
Disappear like David Blaine when it come to affidavits
Aphrodisiac, all on your bitch face like aftershave
I never met Captain Save 'Em, Army, better yet, a Navy
Wore a sweater for the ladies
Pockets heavy, set inflated
That Prometh' it got me faded
Tell the chef that I'm the gravy

Huh, piss me off, I piss back

W-We send you to a different world, please say hi to Sinbad
Now, it's so hard to not bust down the presidential wristband
Got so much platinum on me right now, I look like the tin man
Tunechi a gardener, I'm about to water that bitch implants
You kick it off, I kick your ass, don't piss me off I shit back, huh

Sh-She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
And then tomorrow I forget 'cause it's too hard around this bitch
Need some water, I'ma pop me a blue dolphin, that's for Nip
And I can't go without the sip, bitch, I've been sippin' sincе Lil Flip
Dosing off inside my bitch, so, nigga, I woke up like this
I'm bringing homе the bacon like a pigsty over here, bitch
Pigs fly over here, get shot down and fried over here
Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered everyday that's law and order

These diamonds invaded my grill, got me from ear to ear, smiling like I'm Draymond for real
Go sicko mode, hungry hippo mode
24 carats shining like a glass of Michelob, here's a toast
Here we go, I can not tell if you're really real or not, can't take a loss I can't take a L
I'm famous as hell, I ain't really well, but I'm hanging in there like Patti Labelle
I'm stainless as steel, I'm flawless as fuck, the pain is concealed from all of the drugs

Keep a burner 'til it melt my hand
I been strapped since I was twelve and a half
'Cause I got shot when I was twelve and a half
Thank you for life to the medical staff
Rain turn to ice but it melt when it land
Gangster for life and the life after that
Ain't no referee stripes, but yes, I got my flag
Yee, you don't wanna fuck with me
It could get dirty, I got them bloods with me

I bleed concrete, ain't no cracks
Pulling that hair trigger back like tracks
Check your bitch ass like Air Max

[Verse]
She give me head, and I her pick her up, put her legs in the air, fuck her but don't kiss
She ain't tryna have babies right now, so she open her mouth, and she perform abortion
I got Euros and Pesos and Franks, but if she ask for money, that bitch speaking foreign
Overseas acting like it's New Orleans, I be geeking like Swizzy in Harvard
Businessman, I just walked in the conference, busy man, someone warm me a coffee
Trigger man, I just marked me a target, out the mud, finna walk on your carpet
Label played me and made me a monster, Weezy Baby, no Baby, no sponsor
I'ma stand on the scale with a chopper, what that mean? Bitch, I'm weighing my options
She want Lil Dwayne, I fuck her 'til she came, she cum first, she cum second, and, bae, I'm gon' always cum last
I'ma cum all on your ass, got that shit looking like art on your ass
I give her an inch, she gon' take the whole nine, her pussy lips grin, I'ma make them hoes smile
Bust on her titties, her face, and her eyes, I bust a nut to the back of her throat, and it come out her nose like snot
She say ""Do I look crazy?"" I say ""You look exotic""
You finna fuck me all day off the molly, I'm finna fuck you all night off the drink
I was all in that pussy, so you know what happened, you catch an orgasm like I catch a case
Eating that pussy, she squeezing her thighs, I say, ""I need some breathing room, can't feel my face""
Peep all the moves I be making when I'm in that pussy, she gotta love when I vibrate
Watching my rubber, I know if it slip off inside of that pussy she gon' try to save it
All these red flags, now that hoe got rosacea, she on that black bottle Bumbu, no chaser
I'm tryna get outta here and go taste it, and give that bitch right back to you outta flavor, No Ceilings
Diamonds on deep freeze, ice cubes like Dr. Dre, Eazy
N.W.A, that New Watch Attitude, got bitches, they ain't got attitudes
I'm missing a whole lot of my screws, but she just want my screwdriver, that's bool with me
Told her don't screw it up if you screw with me, 'cause, bitch, I buss a nut, take my tools then leave, where is my hard head?
Lasagna, linguini, fettuccini, pastrami, panini
I order a hit like I'm ordering food, and I feel like a fork and a spoon
Elephant, I just walked in the room, can't forget how to make 'em remember me
Came in your bitch, told her that's a gift from me, since she all under me like a Christmas tree
Slippery like designers in Fiji, it's so wet up inside her bikini, it’s a water balloon
I'ma bust the balloon, look like I made her cum a monsoon
If it ain't, I just jumped in the pool, she say ""Put on your life vest and swim in me""
I said ""I'm 'bout to cum"", she said, ""Gimme me all of this sperm, you bring out the kid in me,"" gotta be kidding me
Diamonds on bling-bling, ooh, my wrist and my collar, my teeth bling, ooh
My ring finger shining like E.T., ooh, she sinking behind and beneath me
Oh, I started from the bottom like seaweed, oh, mentally, physically, literally
It's a conspiracy, really, 'cause lyrically, y'all can't be serious, seriously

You wanna roll with me, you want some smoke with mе
Wanna get high, open your mind and your nose for mе

I'm in a all black coupe likе Dark Knight, girl
These herе Jimmy Choos, not Off-Whites, girl
Five AKs and they pop, NSYNC
Got five lil' baes and they pop and drink
If it's not bright pink then it's not my drink
These bright white links make your eyesight weak
Runnin' through a bag like YouTube money
New Orleans nigga, got beaucoup money
I voodoo somethin', I wish you would do somethin'
Milkin' this shit like the Yoo-Hoo bunny
Got the private plane lit and the Bluetooth runnin'
Tunechi gon' spit like a new tooth comin'
Everybody 5 like the FUBU company
Whole bunch of zeros like a new bag of Funyuns
Tunechi got shottas like Buju Banton
Bullets that'll shoot through mountains
Talkin' that shit and I Doo Doo Brown 'em
I punish these boys, I ground 'em
Yeah, and these funny ass boys, I clowned 'em
I'm laughin' so hard, laugh louder
Yeah, Young Money so raw, no condom
No teeth, just jaws, just tonsils
Fuck everything that they say about me
I done fucked every bad bitch that stay on South Beach
Money talk, mine just gave a nice speech
Just laid a bitch down like Laila Ali
Sittin' in the throne, tryna stay in my seat
It cost to be the boss, bitch payin' my fee
Only smoke blunts, give the J to wifey
Every now and then, I might hit the J like Kyrie
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tatted up and say that they GOATs, just like me
If I inspired you, that's so inspirin'
That Nina work for me, that ho can get fired
Golf Wang Converse, I'm Lil Tyler
Might skate in 'em, might not even rock 'em
Bad bitch, nice top, nice bottom
Fuck her with my chains on, she melt the ice out 'em
Superstar shit, smellin' like roses
Superstar dick, spread it like COVID
Flag red as fuck but I'm golden
Casket lit, was up and I closed it
Opp dead, this Hell and I'm Satan
Thousand bullet shells, yeah I'm blatant
No Ceilings, she's stargazin'
Dead presidents, reincarnated
Tyler Herro, workin' on my jumper
I need a shero, fuckin' Wonder Woman
No Ceilings, third times a charm
Nigga, I don't fuck with you like Big Sean

Fuck with Tune, your tomb get carved in stone
Just like statues of me when I'm gone
Artists, yeah, artillery get drawn
Boy I goes in like outside was a storm
Upgraded, this ain't even my final form
Can't say you ain't been warned, you ain't on what I've been on
I live and breathe and die by this lifestyle shit
It just don't sit on my charm
Take my kindness for weakness then you not strong
Whole city remind me when I'm gone
When I was down bad, I didn't complain
I was at the bottom right where I belong
If you don't climb to the top, you're not as strong
Weezy, that's my twin but we both one of one
I can teach you how to get it one on one
When you ball like this, ho it's not a game
But I'm goin' insane all '21
Bitch think we dated off a one-and-done
And the human race, if it's not a race
It's a quest, a journey, but I'm fuckin' facin'
All the problems that I keep on runnin' from
Got a hitlist, checklist, to-do list, guest list
Super bad bitch list, I don't need a wish list
I'm already gifted, I'm done giving forgiveness
The ones that hate me the most ain't nothin' like me
I could never hate nobody I ain't met or seen
Bluegrass girl, ever since I cut her down
She been havin' wetter dreams, drop the mic, let her sing
I've been ready for the war and whatever that'll bring
From where niggas don't engage and they still let it ring (Brr)
Got back up with me and we movin' in sync
Got killer instincts but I spit that vaccine
I'm only hittin' raw if I hit a couple times
Already with the rubber and the shit didn't stink
Had a chain, gave my brothers, we forever in a link
Gonna roll on the world, let's travel
Well you gotta pay a toll, hmm-hmm, yeah, whatever that means
Weezy said, ""Kill 'em man, fuck all that booty shit""
I’m on that brutal shit
When I say next year is our year, ho, watch what we do to it
Ten plus in and I can't let go
Just like my girl doin' stupid shit
This a lot of y'all that owe me a check, respect and publishing
Yeah, a whole slew and shit
I'm in euphoria with a young thing and she poppin' like Rue and shit
Me and Weezy beat the beat like we Ken and Ryu and shit
I used to hesitate, took my heart
Told my head, ""Lil bitch quit playin' and do this shit""
When you on like this
Every bad bitch come around with ass and titties
Need that double R when you go rags to riches
Need some R&R but now we back to bid'ness, lil' bitch
Yeah, lil' fuckin' bitch

She said, ""Don't you go breaking my achy-break""
I don't fuck with niggas no way, no way
Stay away, far away or the Tommy spray
Chef with the Draco, I'm Bobby Flay
Blood on my apron, my pots and plates
Throw your ass in the grave like a microwave
The oven, the basement, the fireplace
Throw my flag in the air, no United States
Drip too hard, don't stand too close

[Chorus]
Go to war with your whole community
Go to war for these hoes, that's lunacy
I done lost all control of the goon in me
Chopper spark like it's electrocuting me
Pop a bar, sip some barre, smoke some Buddah weed
Pop it off, we can start the buffoonery
Only eat what I kill and watch who I eat
Normally pay for my meal, I'll kill you for free
No Ceilings 3

[Verse]
Tired of these strippers, I'm going at nurses
She write me prescriptions, she light up medicinal
The conditional critical, might need a physical
Cold as a hospital, warm and hospitable
Tommy gun extendo long as a tentacle
I got this octopus on me, it swim with you
I bring apocalypse straight to your living room
Tony the Tiger, you flaky, you cereal
My life a movie, get head underwater
We fuck in my pool, that's chlorine in her pussy
Codeine make the drank bubble like a jacuzzi
Codeine make it pink, something like a petunia
My baby whip faster than mine, she splurging
My baby sip glasses of wine, sip yurple
Take off that mask, bae, your smile don't deserve it
Take her to Belgium for waffles and syrup
Might take her to Paris to buy a few Birkins
They tryna put me in the can, she nervous
Bae Ima man I don’t mind I’ll serve it, just pray for your man pray your honor have mercy
She never leave me, she so down
She hang with actresses, don't even go out
I'm changing my status, I'm changing my profile
Changing my addy, I'm changing my doorknobs
I ran through the pack like it's inches on fourth down
Pour me some actavis, I watch it pour down
I drip every day just to stay in my own house
A nigga just trying to stay out the courthouse
Cullinan foggy, I'm smoking the loggy
I'm too high to argue, I'm too rich to bargain
That pussy my target, I look at my target
That pussy get soggy, her legs are wide open
Her tongue out like Jordan, cum on my Rick Owens
And cum on my Jordans and now I'm tiptoeing all up in her garden
And now her clit sore, I'ma rub on it for her
No Ceiling, nigga, hey
All of my hoes give facial, all of my hoes give fellatio
All of my hoes sensational, all of my hoes interracial
All of my hoes into gay shit, all of my hoes is persuasive
All of my hoes get a date, all of my hoes get 'em wasted
I be right there when you wake, and all of my hoes getting raises, Mula
She never leave me, she so down
I hang with capitalists, don't bring the broke 'round
This automatic a dummy a moron
I make it rain, clear it out like Boban
Run through the pack like inches on fourth down
Pour some actavis, I watch it pour down
I put on drip every day, it's a showdown
She blew my ceilings away, that's a blowjob

Feel like we popped the best meds in the world, don't it? She want that medicine dick
Bustin' nuts, and she act like a squirrel on it, and my shit ain't never been bit
I get up in that pussy with passionate dick, she can never forget, this that elephant dick
Uh, go ahead, sit on it, I took my thumb out her ass, and had shit on it
I know she feel it all in her arteries, I paint her face like an artist
She smokin' on D like Marlboros, I need me a bitch with a twin like the Charlos
She lick on that tip till the tip is a hollow tip, fuck IG, let's make a porno flick
I like big pussy on somе soprano shit, monkey on this banana clip
Messy lil' clit, wettеst lil’ throat, hold on, hold on real quick
We have sex on the beach, go where nobody knows, we got sand on our feet and white sand on our nose
Two nights ago, came in you twice and more, you say you'd like some more, I know you nice and slow
Ooh, you a angel, swallow the cum and say, ""Thank you,"" I say, ""De nada, mi amore""
She wants some Topanga, let me get my dreads out the way, I'm a casket, put the pussy dead in my face
She pull the dick out while I'm sleeping, I'm having wet dreams, she forgot her bikini
Ooh, now she topless, but like Champagne Papi, I start from the bottom, I'm the pussy monster
Might not love her, so when I fuck her, I put both hands on her neck and remind her

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid & Lil Wayne]
Love the way you walk, love the way you talk (Talk)
All the bands on me like a broke gettin' a boss
She'll suck a bag hard but the dick goes soft
She just choked on a dick but a nigga dozed off (Dozed off)
Michael Jackson, how the diamonds dancin'
I'm the boss, wake up, make her buy a phantom
Say he rich forever, so they really can't stand him
Tell her, ""Suck the dick with two hands, I'm handsome""
When I pull up, take a bitch, ain't no ransom
He ain't dropped a hit, he ain't got no anthems (Woo)
It's a plain Patek, I won’t rock no ring
She just ran the money up, now they can't stand him
Might take a bitch to my momma spot (Momma spot)
She was a freaky, she licked me like lollipop
All this water on me, know that I keep a mop
All these cars, it's a G comin', flex a lot (No, Baby)
No babies, you better swallow them for me (For me)

I've been peepin', I've been squintin' and I still can't see a limit
Higher than my limitations, and the fuckin' Himalayas
And I'm stuntin on my neighbors
And the blunt as long as cables
There’s some hundreds on the table
That was our paper towels
Left my number for the waitress
She was flirtin', I embraced it

Here we go

[Verse 1]
Huh, piss me off, I piss back
S-Sixty-nine, that's a 9 tucked right by my six pack
I'm with my slime, treat a toe tag like I treat a trim tac
W-We send you to a different world, please say hi to Sinbad
Now, it's so hard to not bust down the presidential wristband
Got so much platinum on me right now, I look like the tin man
Tunechi a gardener, I'm about to water that bitch implants
You kick it off, I kick your ass, don't piss me off I shit back, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Sh-She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
And then tomorrow I forget 'cause it's too hard around this bitch
Need some water, I'ma pop me a blue dolphin, that's for Nip
And I can't go without the sip, bitch, I've been sippin' sincе Lil Flip
Dosing off inside my bitch, so, nigga, I woke up like this
I'm bringing homе the bacon like a pigsty over here, bitch
Pigs fly over here, get shot down and fried over here
Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered everyday that's law and order
Stick his head in boiling water
Leave eighteen holes on his corner, now I'm golfing
Rickie Fowler, Arnold Palmer, get my shot off
Come in your church, and Peter pop off
See Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like[Chorus]
Come in your church, and Peter pop off
Come where you work, and Peter pop off
Come in your turf, and Peter pop off
Whatever is first, I Peter pop off
Innocent person, Peter pop off
After I squirt, she clean her top up
Pop a perc, so Peter pop off
Whatever is first, I Peter pop off

[Verse 2]
Faded for real, skating for real, my niggas brazy for real, yeah
Get paid to get killed, get sprayed to get spilled, get shot from your head to your heels, yeah
She head over heals, she taking these pills, they give her the craziest thrills
I'm sedated a lil, but ain't no big deal, still fuck like I'm straight outta jail
The feds is raiding my crib but ain't no big deal, I'm way ahead of the field
These diamonds invaded my grill, got me from ear to ear, smiling like I'm Draymond for real
Go sicko mode, hungry hippo mode
24 carats shining like a glass of Michelob, here's a toast
Here we go, I can not tell if you're really real or not, can't take a loss I can't take a L
I'm famous as hell, I ain't really well, but I'm hanging in there like Patti Labelle
I'm stainless as steel, I'm flawless as fuck, the pain is concealed from all of the drugs
Brr, Hello I'm calling your bluff, here we go

[Pre-Chorus]
Sh-She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
And then tomorrow I forget, it-it's too hard around this bitch

She give me head, and I her pick her up, put her legs in the air, fuck her but don't kiss
She ain't tryna have babies right now, so she open her mouth, and she perform abortion
I got Euros and Pesos and Franks, but if she ask for money, that bitch speaking foreign
Overseas acting like it's New Orleans, I be geeking like Swizzy in Harvard
Businessman, I just walked in the conference, busy man, someone warm me a coffee
Trigger man, I just marked me a target, out the mud, finna walk on your carpet
Label played me and made me a monster, Weezy Baby, no Baby, no sponsor
I'ma stand on the scale with a chopper, what that mean? Bitch, I'm weighing my options
She want Lil Dwayne, I fuck her 'til she came, she cum first, she cum second, and, bae, I'm gon' always cum last
I'ma cum all on your ass, got that shit looking like art on your ass
I give her an inch, she gon' take the whole nine, her pussy lips grin, I'ma make them hoes smile
Bust on her titties, her face, and her eyes, I bust a nut to the back of her throat, and it come out her nose like snot
She say ""Do I look crazy?"" I say ""You look exotic""
You finna fuck me all day off the molly, I'm finna fuck you all night off the drink
I was all in that pussy, so you know what happened, you catch an orgasm like I catch a case
Eating that pussy, she squeezing her thighs, I say, ""I need some breathing room, can't feel my face""
Peep all the moves I be making when I'm in that pussy, she gotta love when I vibrate
Watching my rubber, I know if it slip off inside of that pussy she gon' try to save it
All these red flags, now that hoe got rosacea, she on that black bottle Bumbu, no chaser
I'm tryna get outta here and go taste it, and give that bitch right back to you outta flavor, No Ceilings
Diamonds on deep freeze, ice cubes like Dr. Dre, Eazy
N.W.A, that New Watch Attitude, got bitches, they ain't got attitudes
I'm missing a whole lot of my screws, but she just want my screwdriver, that's bool with me
Told her don't screw it up if you screw with me, 'cause, bitch, I buss a nut, take my tools then leave, where is my hard head?
Lasagna, linguini, fettuccini, pastrami, panini
I order a hit like I'm ordering food, and I feel like a fork and a spoon
Elephant, I just walked in the room, can't forget how to make 'em remember me
Came in your bitch, told her that's a gift from me, since she all under me like a Christmas tree
Slippery like designers in Fiji, it's so wet up inside her bikini, it’s a water balloon
I'ma bust the balloon, look like I made her cum a monsoon
If it ain't, I just jumped in the pool, she say ""Put on your life vest and swim in me""
I said ""I'm 'bout to cum"", she said, ""Gimme me all of this sperm, you bring out the kid in me,"" gotta be kidding me
Diamonds on bling-bling, ooh, my wrist and my collar, my teeth bling, ooh
My ring finger shining like E.T., ooh, she sinking behind and beneath me
Oh, I started from the bottom like seaweed, oh, mentally, physically, literally
It's a conspiracy, really, 'cause lyrically, y'all can't be serious, seriously

Oh, Young Money, money so old

It was at the House of Versace, me and Kanye was spotted (Oh)
He offered me some wings (Oh)
I told him, ""Don't even bother, I'm already flyin'"" (Woah)
You better not bleed on my carpet (No)

It feels like my throne is on fire
You tried to call it a day, but my phone was on silent (Hello?)
I'ma keep fuckin' these hoes (Woah)
I'ma keep guttin' these hoes, I ain't stuntin' these hoes (Woah)

Let's pop us a pill, I'll let you know when I feel something, babe

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, tell me not to love these hoes
I'm flexing on my exes, bae
They found out I'm with somebody else
They wanna fist fight, they wanna cat fight
You wanna fuck yourself when I'm on TV
You see tattoos all over my back
Diamonds on the grill, babe
You wanna roll with me, you want some smoke with mе
Wanna get high, open your mind and your nose for mе
I just love it, then I taste it
Make a man say, ""Mmm, babe""
Now, turn around, look back at me, can I be your mirror?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She walked on my moon, she played in my hair
I love the sound of those heels, you walkin' 'round here struttin', babe

Then, she whispered in my ear and said, ""This pussy is for the taking,"" okay
Twizzy Baby quick to get these bitches naked
Bumbu, a cup of Aces, got these hoes switching places
I promised to keep a secret, she promised to let me taste it
Her booty big and amazing, she love the way I embraced it
Get the game from Tha Carter, Young Carter bring home the bacon
Still pimpin', I was shot by Cupid, I hope he grazed me

My other bitch cute, and she dangerous, think I don't make it, huh

Ayy, the blues is now kickin', and dinner is three Michelin
I don't eat red meat, but still got beef sizzlin'
Know that I need discipline
I keep singin' for all these hoes, they keep listenin'
Niggas love to bro up with the boy and dap fists-es
But we are not equivalent, dawg
I been an only child, don't need siblings
And I'm past them like the times that he's livin' in, okay
Man, if you saw what I flew here, you'd be like, ""He's sickenin'""
If you not runnin' some top, we not gon' keep kickin' it
Classics, I keep scribblin', lights in the Universal building just keep flickerin'
Money just keep comin' in, you would think I'm Irish the way that it stays doublin'
I could feed a country with the tax that I pay governments
Whatеver they're doin' with my cash is vеry troublin'
Okay, February came around, I used to get paid shovelin'
Sold clothes, walked dogs, trust me, I stay hustlin'
When it came to school, there's no way that I'm A-plus-in' it
So I just dropped out of it, trust me, I'm not proud of it
Niggas get too comfy in they spot, they get knocked out of it
Niggas get a gun just so they can make props out of it
Shawty make a scene in the house, she get locked out of it
Yeah, you not 'bout to be chillin' in this bitch with kicked feet up
I'ma make you bounce out this ho like Big Freedia
Pete O. used to throw a purple tint on a two-liter
First private plane I ever rode was a eight-seater
Before that, I got the bedroom hot with a space heater
On top of that, I didn't have shit to my name either, that's real
But now I'm givin' house tours 'til it's back to world tours
Play that ""Mask Off"" when they find the real cure
I might not be good for her, but I'm real to her
Got no time for her, but give Richard Mille to her
That's the only way I know how to express love
My dawgs love sticks and drums like they Questlove
All them jokes about Aubrey, they got me messed up, for real
I come with a lot of complications inside me
It's always people misleadin' me that are tryna guide me
Everyone wants to try me, but no one wants to buy me
Everyone wants to meet me, but no one wants to keep me

I'm better than perfect, I'm sick, I need to see a medical person
Eatin' all of these rappers with these edible verses
All I gotta be is all that I can possibly
She really, really into me, then suck it all up out of me
I'm proud of me, I don't know how to be sorry, apologies
You fuckin' with my math, you better know some trigonometry

Nigga, you might be a CI, talkin' to the FBI
Big beast to the east-side, now she's on my G5
Fuck on her to some C5, cut on Funeral and she die
Your reach ain't long enough, yo' peeps ain't strong enough
Yo' beach ain't warm enough
You ain't been in the throne
'Cause the seat ain't warm enough
And nigga, I'm the only one
I got the crown on, I'm the goat and you the pony, son
Don't let me do it to him Dunie 'cause I overdo it
The choppa was too big for me, had to grow into it
His stylist split his wig for me if I told her do it
We hit his crib and broke into it, if it's smoke, we blew it
We don't believe you, you need more people
Ain't shit sweet, boy, you need more Equal
You ain't runnin' shit, boy, feed your Ezekiel
All my niggas rich, boy, clean no illegal
Don't let em gas you, like Tunechi reading Thrasher
He won't thrash you 'cause I'll be glad to split your apple, I had to
Stab you, chop you up in the bathroom so casual
Then drop you off in front of a chapel with candles
Detach you, body from soul
Anita Baker body and soul, come out of my soul
I made a way to the rockiest roads and highway patrol
Full speed ahead clean the bread from the sloppiest joes
I got it in the hot and the cold, the mud in the rain
I stomach the pain, got more bloods than the blood in my veins
I'm huntin' the game, you guys ain't fuckin with Wayne
Ask your vibe 'cause she fuckin' Lil Wayne, yeah

Don't get me wrong, bitch get me right
Don't blow up my phone, no dynamite
She give me them jaws, that shark don't bite
Pussy I eat, don't feed me lies
She say that she gay, I say ""hooray"" (Yeah)
You just my type (Yeah), I love them dykes (Yeah)
I'm on a pill, she done some white (Shit)
Her Tongue was red, yeah, I run the light (Nyum)

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
IG, TikTok, nope, she say she saw me on Triller, yeah
Squad up, squadzilla, yeah
Throw a three hundred thou' out the window, yeah, uh
I'm rich but I'm slimy, go low on lil' mami
I look up, and she say she finna cum
I say ""Yeah, I know,"" she say ""Please take it slow""
And I hit her with the E-40 flow
This triple X-Rated, that triple-stacked ecstacy pill make her cum 'til she come undone
She put coke on my dick and her tongue get numb
She too numb to talk shit, she can't pump her gums
I flew to Paris just to say ""bonjour""
Flew to Amsterdam just to smoke the good
Flew to Napa Valley just to taste the grapes
Flew to H-Town just to get an eight
I got the industry wanna be me
The same imagery, all I see is lil' me
I'm in the Rolls Royce with her doonies
Dripping all this milkshake on them Kelis
Like bling in the light
She wanna fuck on the king, not a knight
I pick her up, put her feet in the sky
When we fuck, sound like Tina and Ike
I put some cum in her drink, now it's spiked
She 'bout to drink it like white wine
Can't cry over spilled milk, but that cum look like milk in her mouth
If she spill it, I might cry
Pop the coco, some Rosé, Dom Pérignon
I pull up with a hoe out a catalogue
Drop her off then go pick up her famo
Knock her off, take her shit, then I vamos
Gucci links from the rocks as a choker
Matching bracelet and watch, I'm supposed to
R.I.P. to the Pop, make me smoke ya
S-A-P for the opp, buenos noches
M-O-B to the mob, cosa nostra
L-I-T and I'm high as the voltage
Extra lean, extra pot, extra dosage
Extra cream in the crop, that's the potion
Extra clips, extra shots at your soldiers
Seventeen in the Glock, no emotion
Extra bang, extra pop and explosion
Turn his body to ash, he need lotion
The clock always wrong but I'm right on time
It's Blood gang, bitch, we ball, yeah, like five on five
Fuck that, I'll pop me a seal, pour up a line

Working while they sleeping as usual
Percocets, I eat them like chewables
These niggas think they passed up, they think too much
If these niggas get too gassed up, I bring a few pumps
Yeah, Hershey chocolate candy skin, she ate all my nuts
Yeah, wifey caught me slipping once, okay, more than once
Yeah, we don't hit your block up, we blow that bitch up
Cappin', talkin' big shit until that shit don't flush
Yeah, they say my days are numbered, but I keep taking drugs
Baby, I know you see these X pills, pleasе take one
I'm a skater but I hеard your man a cheapskate, huh
Heard he rattin', now they moving his release date, huh, snitch
I just turned my main to my spouse
Could've bought her ass the tote purse or pouch, bought a house
Now baby got an ego twice the size of the crib
Now she see what I'm saying, she got eyes in her ears
Never turn your back on Weezy F B, God forbid
I might have to do a bid if she left me, I forgive
Twerkin', got a fatty in this bitch, doing butt flips
Way she roll her hips make her body look like Sunchips
Working out my demons, that's beautiful
And bae off of that riesling, she super loose
I'm smokin', she say pass it, she doing too much
Haven't done my taxes, fuckin' with Trump
She brought her skirt without the panties with the slit going up
Nigga caught you looking at it, it's okay, don't touch
Uh, someone bought the block up in Bel-Air, it was us

Nigga, we are not on the same time
Shoulder strap on the strap, hangtime
Got the 40 on me like St. Ides
Granny, she was standing right there
Mercedes car, they call her Mrs. Mercy
Ever since the day I got her name tatted on my face, I been picture perfect
Taliban, nigga, ISIS, hand to hand, switching prices
Been dapper dan since the diaper, a gat, a bag, and a Bible
Young Obama go dumb, Osama
Hit him with the llama, he do the la bamba
Trade the private jet for an F1 bomber
We could go to war like it's the Bahamas
Lied to my hoes, never to my mama
Never tell my woes, lie to your honor
Money long though, nigga, anaconda
Let me add a comma
I'm way too high for niggas at the bottom
You a ladder climber
I'm the best rapper, nigga, that's the obvious
Got punchlines for you shadowboxers

Two beautiful bitches but my bitch more beautiful, bitches
Bae you too delicious, bae, I'm the key, you the ignition

Got some hoes that got bitches, I be taking their bitch

Treat a trap house like a beach

""I love you"", I don't let her know it's a game

Young Mula, baby

[Verse 1: Euro]
I belong to the world, don't be selfish with me
When I go places with Wayne, you would think Elvis with me
My niggas livin' in Hell, they thinkin' Heaven sent me
When she scream, ""Fuck love,"" I think she meant me
I get in the zone, applyin' pressure
You get the message, only I ain't text ya
Y'all like to gamble with life, you lucky I ain't bet ya
So you survived a few cats, don't let a lion get ya
If I ain't met ya, I ain't ever move ya
If there's a new year then I never knew ya
Look, my junior gon' have a future
And my senior gotta drive a Beamer
I wish my dawgs could turn they felonies to misdemeanors
Ayy, 'cause I met a girl with features out in Italy
Wish they had seen her
Shoulda took a picture, I packed condoms
I shoulda packed a book with scriptures
Put me in the Rock Hall of Fame with all the suicidal niggas, iconic figures
If rivals come for us, then they comin' with us
Tell 'em, ""Run, Forrest,"" run for the fame, runnin' with us
What's one life to a hunnid killas?
All you heard was loud sirens and lighter flickers

I made a mill' right after breakfast, that's a power lunch
I fuck your bitch for 'bout a hour, that's a power fuck
I fuck your bitch up in the shower, that's a shower fuck
I fuck your bitch and now she pregnant, shit, we outta luck
HoodyBaby, Master P's 'boutta 'boutta buck
I been slackin', Major Bass, I could battle up
Picture me somewhere tropic, prolly mad as fuck
But I'm cool, body language break the barrier
Broken bitches wishin' that I fix her up and carry her
I was out in Italy, Roman like my carrier
I done lost hoes, turned around, I done lost bros
I just got ghost, hit a nigga with the Death Star

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Dear Heavenly Father, is there a church in the wild?
For the fugitives that I harbor
Yeah, we move like a mile, my op'll send out the orders
Got some people in Texas, their crib is right by the border
Place your order for cola, ain't talkin' pop like soda
Vacuum seal all the packages, tryna drown out the odor
No weapons formed against me shall prosper
The streets praise us like gospel
So we move and we roam like them Italian mobsters
Practice the code of silence, omérta
So ain't no talkin', we lurkin'
Find the strip where you workin'
Closed curtains, fear no man but God
Now they callin' me Lord
I pray on the sinners when bald palms touchin' like an applause
Synagogue is like the Pentagon, arms cover my flaws
Quiet storm but lion-hearted, I wake up with a roar
Call me the clean up, man, I sweep shit up like a chore
Then sweep your chick off her feet, put her in my stable of whores
Mentally stable, not sure, screws loose, shake to the floor
Breakin' records on the radio while breakin' the law
I keep my faith in the Lord, one day I'll make it to Forbes
[LAT] them thieves is comin', and what we takin' is yours
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Look, I'm not worthy of your controversy
I'm not thirsty, baby, I'm allergic
Giddy up, dick ridin', swervin'
Yeehaw, that's Kentucky Derby
I remember lyin' on the gurney
Thinkin' how I'ma die early
Never thought that I'd see thirty
Oh, the journey, had to fuckin' earn it
I go back in time when I was flirtin'
That time that I was flirtin' with uncertain
Never thought I'd be surrounded by
Housekeepers, chauffeurs, chefs and servants
Diamonds screamin', ""Oh my lovely God""
Sippin' syrup, watchin' out for serpents
Touch my surface, then it's closed curtains
Oh my God, you're meetin' God in person
Oh my God, I want the squad alerted
And I come from it, they hop up like Kermit
Corner turnin' with marijuana burnin'
In the trunk, you squirmin', now here come to sermons
Oh my God, every thot a burden
I ain't worry, got her ridin' dirty
Trap house poppin' like it's Pee Wee Herman's
The plug alerted, now the socket workin'
Other niggas catchin' power surges
I'm determined just like my attorney
You other niggas, you ain't got attorneys
Order new trap house, I buy it furnished
I been listenin', listenin' to the money
It been tellin', tellin' me, ""It's comin'""
Soundin' like music to my ears
Soundin' like a symphony of hundreds
Grandma always said that I'd be special
Mama always said that I'd be somethin'
I had to make sure that they wasn't guessin'
So I made the most out of they assumptions
Bein' careful 'round my pistol
Nigga all up in a bimbo
Bein' everything but simple
Got my deal without a demo, Tunechi

Okay, Comme Des Garçons and some new Saint Laurent
I mix Gianni Versace with Coco Chanel
I throw on some Fendi, a mink when it's windy
Too cold for the Devil, I'm snowin' in Hell
Skatin' on marble, I flow in thin air
I'm dancin' on water, tip-toein' on nails
Can't walk in my shoes, can't roll in my wheels
Can't order my food, you throw up that meal
Can't do what I do, you can't do me
Yeah, I would not try to do you, I'm too me
Look at my sons' faces, I see the new me
I look into they face and I see the beauty
I take a vacation and go see some beautiful shit
Come back with a whole different view of this shit
My third eye just opened 'cause two wasn't shit
It's either that or too many hallucinogens
Got a cute-ass lil' bitch with a coke habit
That lil' bitch at my crib 'til the snow cappin'
When we fuck, man, that shit make her go faster
She so numb, man, that bitch ain't got no passion
Ain't no love in that bitch, ain't no romancin'
Ain't no love in that bitch, ain't got no magic
Ain't no judgin' that bitch 'cause we both addicts
She in love with this dick, it got gold status
Huh, Comme Des Garçons
I got that bread like a biscuit, a bun or croissant
Got the feds on my dizzick, they bustin' my balls
And she play with my dick, make me bust in my drawers
And I take off my Ethika, I'm gettin' naked
And she gettin' wet and now I'm gettin' erections
Oh, she say it spiritual when I have sex with her
I'm blessin' her, I think I pop too much ecs' with her
I fuck with my ex with her, you keep the rest of her
Don't care who left with her, I don't wan' F with her
Hop off that pedestal if you wan' leave
Then it was my pleasure, them thots is more pleasurable
I'm on my medical, smokin' my vegetable
Bro cut my revenue down to the decimal
Rollie, I stare at you, then I start tellin' you
How much I care for you, I diamond bezel you
Comme Des Garçons with that Yves Saint Laurent
I mix new CDG with some new YSL
I pop my trunk, how this new chopper feel?
All you get is ""buck-buck"" like a two-dollar bill
I'm so fucked up, they say, ""You gotta chill""
So-so fucked up, Tunechi, you're outta here
Raw in the cut, smokin' dope, poppin' pills
Since I'm goin' so nuts, I drip pure almond milk
Ugh, Comme Des Garçons, fuck what they all say
Nigga, fuck what they done, I give a fuck what they on
I run in your place, like, ""Honey, I'm home,"" like, ""Honey, I'm wrong""
'Cause I tell you, ""I love you,"" and honey, I don't
Got too many girlfriends, got too many girlfriends, one in my trunk
Ooh, money, I flaunt, ooh, money, I flaunt
I spend money on war, which one of y'all want war?
None of y'all want war, that's what the fuck l thought
Fuck you thought, I drop a contract on your heart
Give a fuck what that cost, suffer that loss
Stuffed in that box and dumped in that park
Fuck you thought, I drop a contract on your heart
Give a fuck what that cost, gotta suffer that loss
Stuffed in that box and dumped in that park

Black Lives Matter, what's up with these cops?
I'm spittin' this fire, I do not expire
Just pass me the lighter and we not gon' stop
They callin' me Freddy, you know I'm the Krueger
Teachin' these classes like I am a tutor
Got too much girls, I'm callin' them hooters
Kobe, number eight
Most of these girls, they just want the fame
If he just want money then get out my lane (Ching, ching)
These vibes are so crazy, I'm goin' insane
I pull up to school and you know I ain't late
They call me ""Lil' psychic,"" got medium fade
I see that you're nervous, I see it in your face
They call me ""Almighty,"" you cannot escape
You cannot escape, you cannot escape (Nope)
Just got a new 'Rari and bought a new Lambo (Skrrt)
Watchin' a movie but it is not Rambo
Killin' this beat, I know you a fan, bro
I know you a fan, bro
I'm not Chinese but pull up with chop-sticks
I'm like La Flame, I'm bringing the mosh pits
I am the villain, no reason to stop this
No reason to stop this
I don't want 'rona but pull up with soap (Corona)
I am so great that they call me the G.O.A.T
I pray to God that I get a blessing
I am young grinder, no need for resting
My name is Dwayne, put respect on that
Gettin' this money, I stack up racks (Racks)
These rappers in my lane, I spit facts
Your breath stink, need some Tic Tacs (Tic Tac)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
These ain't no SD
Bitch, these Jimmy Choos, might be the Miu Mius
Might be the Giuseppes
Bitch, you could get left, so bitch, get me right
You gotta impress me
Lil' bitch walking 'round with her titties out
Like she gon' breastfeed
Police raiding my spot
They saw it was me and took selfies
Play with them guns
Soon as they pop I'm gon' hit my target
In front of his broad, in front of his daughters
I'm so remorseless
We in Miami in the middle of a pandemic
And we on a new beach
Working that salmon, runnin' that sushi
I cannot mention my hoes inside of my songs
'Cause I know they be bragging a lot
I can't keep these pills, getting high with these bitches
I'm supposed to be handing 'em out
Show me that nigga who say he getting rich off of dope
'Cause my niggas be jabbing a lot
I heard that you and them niggas you with ain't no joke
My niggas laughing out loud, yeah
That shit was awesome, took her to Nordstroms
Just had a foursome, didn't have to force 'em
You cannot come back around me
You turn your back on me, I cannot forgive
You need to stop fucking with strippers
Tou run into agents and giving 'em tips
We kill your slime, we take your work
We take your bitch, you a bitch
My bitch is a snob, my fool is a jerk
And I bet this missile don't miss

Shorty might got a pole but won't pop shit
He be talking like he down to drop shit
Bitch I'm up in your crib and I don't got a key
I be all in yo shit like a locksmith (Get em)
And we ain't throwing hands, better stop it
You ain't see no white flag when we squash shit (Nah)
And you know what's gon' happen when Tune put me right on a track
Bitch, you know that's the squad shit
Heard your funds just got low, ain't no job, nigga
So you out here, and you bout to starve nigga
I was in your position, and back in the day, I was all by myself, I would rob niggas
Now my money up, I'm living large, nigga
Ain't no need to relive in the dark, nigga
Now I'm 'bout to skrrt off of the lot in the Bentley
And take up two spots when I park, nigga (Skrt)
Man, these niggas be boasting
I don't even drink on the liquor
'Cause when I skate, bitch, I need focus
No comedian joking, man
I hope he get his ass right on the stand so my youngins can roast him
Man, you know why I'm chosen, 'cause I ran here first in the game, put my foot down 'til that bitch was choking
This shit be promotion 'cause I'm smoking on this good kush, bitch, and it's potent

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Lean, water, intelligence, nigga finding your medicine
My weapons will knock an ottoman out of your residence
Got your wife on the edible, secret service
And she taking it down like the president
Can't survive in my element
If you never been in stride with the lions and elephants
When they free all my niggas then wherever Weezy be
Where I'm flying the felons in (Yup)
They be rhyming so predicate
Then, when you see 'em in person, they quiet and delicate
And 'til somebody die for the death of your brethren
I cannot buy what you selling in
We met at the Mandalay she live in San Jose
Visiting town with a friend today
When they hop in the Laundaulet
We 'bout to fuck over mandolins, champagne and creme brulée
Tell your little mans to stay in his place
Don't wanna get shot in your shin today
Nigga play on the internet, I don't get into that
I send a shot in your shin today
Way too many niggas and not enough bitches for all of this bitch shit
Too many to name, you know who to call
For real, some pimp shit
What you saying is not realistic
I just left Elliante the district
But I still go to Vice with the biscuit
Even still for a slice and I missed it
'Bout to gamble your life on a trip bitch
I be rolling the dice on on her lipstick
I'm a different type of sadistic
I don't look at the price when I get shit
I don't put in no ice when I sip shit
Lot of boomers and lights when I clip shit
Leave the room looking like I just flipped shit
She be riding me like I'm a ripstick
She say she want a body for Christmas
I'm living like some bucket list shit
If you don't like it suck a sick dick1Embed"

Three, uh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm bout to shoot at a nigga, no layup
I pull up and step back and I get my J up, yea
Point-blank, I shoot at a nigga
Or shoot at her nigga from far like I'm Trae Young
Shoot at a nigga, no airball, ooh
Shoot at a nigga, no backboard
I break a full court press up at half-court
That's no cap like an afro

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I swing that stick like Wayne Gretzky
I keep a K on me like I'm Coach K, Mike Krzyzewski
Hope you set tripping, then I gotta send shots
Get your whole set shot, quiet on the set bitch
Shoot at a nigga, no bank shot
Check the game clock, nigga, time is too precious
I shoot at a nigga, no rebound
Shoot the whole team down, rookies and veterans
She give me face time, no texting
She give me face through the zipper, bow
Open face, Tunechi got shooters like Golden State
Shoot at a nigga, no dribble, no handle
Shoot at a nigga, no dribble, no travel
Shoot at a nigga, no Euro-step
Still have my dribble, ain't using my pivot yet
Aim at his rim, and I hit the net
Shoot at the cheerleaders, blood on the pom-poms
Shoot your coach up, shoot the sidelines
Court side seats, get blood on the popcorn
Shoot you like Jordan, like Bron-Bron
Shoot at a nigga like Harden from the outside
Nigga can't guard, can't block mine
Shoot at a nigga, going hard from the foul line
Heater on call, it's a hotline
Shoot at a nigga, no double-dribble
Shoot at a nigga, no crossover
Driveway looking like a toy store
I'ma ball, I'ma never turn the ball over
I'ma shoot at a nigga, on Mula
Pull up with two hundred guns, it's a shootout
Shoot at a nigga, no hooping, no hoopla
Tunechi, lil nigga, No Ceilings, no rooftop
I'm 'bout to spray at that nigga, no drizzle
Get down and lay down lil nigga, no pillow
I light up a J on a nigga, no Leno
I'm slime everyday on a nigga, no schedule
All of these lil' niggas claiming they killas
Just holding up guns, taking pictures in the mirror
Pop me a seal, I pour a line and reseal it
Then I laugh at these niggas
Don't they look like my children?
Giggle, giggle, giggle, giggle
She lick it right after I bust—that shit tickle
She swallow a shot glass of nut like tequila
She like to talk when she fuck, I couldn't hear her
She like to walk on my rug, it's chinchilla
She wan' fuck on my rug, I say, ""Bitch, that's chinchilla""
She like to masturbate while on her period
Then suck her finger, I swear she the weirdest
My trigger finger, that's all with my blood
Used to party with bloods, now Hollywood drugs
Got bitches on drugs in the car waiting for us
Waiting on there to fuck and then all day we fucking
And all night we bucking, all white, the cups in it
Cocaine is soft, all white deluxe
And his head might come off and you might see his guts
And it might make you barf and the memory blush
Run it, run it
I can't keep up 'cause I might be on blow
And I might be on rush, yeah, I might be on slow
'Cause I might be on codeine and promethazine
This ain't minor league bruh, I need ice in my punchy
Put ice on my nuts, that be icy as fuck
I'll be icy icy, very pricey
I be so lit up they call me ""Chris Lighty""
You could get lit up just for some enlightment
Fuck the indictments
I fuck the crystal and I fuck the diamond
I fuck some swimmers, and I fuck some divers
Never been fishy, but I fuck the Pisces
I fuck the simple and I fuck the silent
I fuck the gentle and I fuck the kindly
I fuck the physical, I fuck the violent
Then I fuck the mental and I fuck the body

Welcome to the funeral, yeah
Closed casket as usual
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
The choir's singin' musicals
Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with that Uzi, though
And they look like they saw Lucifer
Rrr
Welcome to the funeral
We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke
(Phew)
That's just unexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them
We been to quite a few of 'em
The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

[Verse]
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Soul snatching, that's usual
Amen, hallelujah though
Whole family delusional
Niggas cryin' like two-year-olds
Bullet holes come through the doors
I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose
Damn, welcome to your funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin', though
Gotta die to see who you know
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin them
The preacher preach, we shootin' him
Now we need one for you and him
That's why they should cremate ya
Hope when you die they commemorate you
Life is a movie and it's in theaters
Some of y'alls already went to cable
Get shot from afar, you can get a facial
Black gun, chrome gun, interracial
Weed so strong, need ventilation
Funeral home need renovation
I got your mom's teary-eyed, that's precipitation
Nigga, when you died, did your bitch a favor
Nigga, we gon' mob like the Genoveses
Nigga, fat mob, I'ma Jenny Craig 'em
Drive-bys in a Winnebago
Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes
From a hundred feet away, now it's a halo
That's tomato sauce, Heinz 57
Catch up, nigga, you behind, where I left you
I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins
Uncles, aunts, and your nephew (Pfft)
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Look his pretty kid in the face, poor bastard
Tears runnin' down his bitch face, romantic
Two straps on me like the old Bo Jacksons (Bah)
In his face, closed casket
Send him on the highway to heaven, no traffic
My lil' nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic
He cried tears of joy, then he got 'em tatted
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Whole family delusional
Amen, hallelujah though
Choir singing musicals, Kumbaya, it's beautiful

We don't like these niggas, we don't fight these niggas
We ""good night"" these niggas, you look like these niggas
Fu-fuck it-fuck it up, fuck 'em up
Hit him up, hunt 'em down, hurry up
Shoot him up, shut him down, shut him up
Eat her out, dick her down, cuddle up
But bitches comin' 'round with the funny love
Lick me up, lick me down, done enough
Eat her up, spit her out, bubblegum
Treat her right, treat her out, trouble come
Got some cocaine and a couple blunts
It's ashes to ashes, dust to dust
.44 plastic, the rubber bust
We don't wear masks, 'cause it must be us
I got the Holy Ghost in my Backwood
On my tippytoes and them flat-foot
Bitch pigeon-toed and her cat good
I know her pussy hole like my MacBook
She Tootsie-Roll on the black wood
Get her own page in the black book
And it's startin' to feel like I'm attached to her
If it's that good, I put a stamp to her
I'm a warlord to these fuckin' boys
Double-edged sword and a bubble, boy
I just won a war in a Hummer 'fore I'm 'bout to come to yours
Lookin' for a war, I am nothin' more than somethin' more
Than much more as the punch pour
And I slunch more with my lungs sore
I smoke you and your blunt blowers
Let's get on with it, Megatron with it
Telephone like a telethon
Bitches workin' bitches like a Peloton
Finish yellow bones dizzy, very long visits
And I'm talkin' numbers, Jerry Jones digits
I'm at home sippin', and I'm gone sippin'
Got a Draco with my arm in it
Shoot you in your heart, put some charm in it
Sorry, gotta leave your mama tormented
""Bah, bah, bah"" if she commented
Cops pulled up, and they vomited
I am not finished, hope they long-winded
Money long-livin' with a strong finish
Dead presidents, wasn't born with it, I'ma die with it
I'm amor with it, didn't start livin' 'til the war ended

Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t shittin' roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I’m looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended
Pause, like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters: I’m a shooting star
Life is a course, and I'ma shoot for par
Searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, man, I’ll see what I find tomorrow

Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me

But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell

Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail

Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish, ha!

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side
Bitch, I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him"" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothing, keep resting,""
She say, ""What's missing?""—""How you know something missing?""
He scratched his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,""
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, ""Ooh""

And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care

She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,""
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me a salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier!""
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga

Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
For a minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,""

Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)

I, put it together, common denominator
I tear it up like loose leaf paper
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge
I knock her lights out, I blow her fuse
See we don't even fuck no more, we make love
And now shes on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds
Cause she my honey bee, yeah, buzz buzz
And now I'm itching and scratching, that's that love bug
[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)

Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""whine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""

And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't

Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas

And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I am entering)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will

Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such
Damn, where is the fucking trust
I'm tired of the hoop and hollering
I'm 'bout to take the coupe to Collins
Then take a female to the Island
Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas
I'm fucking her friends
Now her friends ain't even fucking with her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off she ain't even spelling shit right
I text her back, and tell her it's life
Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me

She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off

Swimming trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight

And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right

What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Balling 'til my hair is as white as Johnny Carson
You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, ""Don't mind the little voices,"" woah

[Verse 1]
What's harder, love or Mr. Carter?
Especially when these hoes ain't right, these hoes ain't loyal
Shit, who's wrong? Who's right? Just ask my lawyer
Right or wrong, I'm still gon' take his advice, he take my orders
I'll be a-okay instead of alright, or kinda-sorta
And before I ever take that for granted, I take the charges
See, you can't believe in all of the hype you hear at the barber
If the odds are stacked against us, they're likely to stack 'em on us
Lil Tune, Jurassic in the room, Tyrannosaurus
I ain't steal it, I took it, I ain't crooked, I'm cater-cornered
And if my fruits of labor were ripe, I would have an orchard
But I'm nauseous from my ups-and-downs and back-and-forwards
Shit, Mr. Carter, eyes are always on you
So I smile for the cameras and hide from the reporters
Roll a blunt up in this bitch, when it burn, it start my motor
Shoulder shruggin' in this bitch 'cause the world is on my shoulders, shit
What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Tune in this bitch, let's spike the Holy Water
Tryna stay grounded, my flights said no departures
Shit, what's harder, murder or abortion? Woah
What's harder, death or Mr. Carter?
Is it easier to play deaf or to listen harder?
I'm like, ""Girl, what's harder than life for Mr. Carter?
Knock on wood, but with the wood comes termites and turmoil""
What's easier, to change diapers or back to normal?

What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
I ride for this shit like a knight in shining armor
I pile up the dope and roll it tight like UnderArmour
Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas
I got homies from the old school, and we been lost our diplomas
Got some hoes from California, think they shit smell like begonias
Got a bone to pick? I pick it 'til you're boneless
Like I come from San Antonio, pop up at the spur of the moment, how you want it?

Heat up out my abdomen, and you know me
Man, I'm all about my business, business handle business for me
I know you know life's a bitch, turned her to a business woman, mind your business

Should I call you Mystery? Because I'm right here to solve you
And if you start to smell fear or fright, I sprayed it on you""

[Verse 1]
I just bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
Got too much on my mind, hit the blunt and reflect
When I was under arrest, my bitch was under duress
I bet she fucked while I was gone, then I doubled the bet
I smoke weed in Amsterdam and I smuggle the rest
I act like I'm shakin' your hand and you'll get punched with the left
And you can get killed for shit you said under your breath
And if you do choose to bark, it ain't nothin' to a vet
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Yo bitch about to swallow a bunch of me's, nigga
I got a white girl fuckin', suckin' me, nigga
While I'm thinkin' 'bout the days that it sucked to be niggas

[Chorus]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
Nigga, keep your head up like that gun to ya neck
And my bitch was scared to fly 'til we fucked on a jet
Fucked her in the cockpit, all these buttons to press

[Verse 2]
I just got myself a blonde with the puffiest chest
I just bought myself some time, wrote my Rollie a check
Ridin' in a double R, just regrettin' regret
Getting loaded more than once, no Russian Roulette
I just left King of Diamonds, I just fucked a baguette
I ain't called her since that day, I just wasn't impressed
Bull with a nose ring, startin' a bunch of BS
Hide the gun, knock on your door, dressed like UPS
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
I'm a bear coughing up a bunch of honeybees, nigga
Got hoes under me, like a submarine, nigga
Got a bitch with a clit like a butter bean, nigga (Uh)
See Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like[Chorus]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC (Yeah)
Bought my sons toys and my daughter a pet
Bought my homeboys choppers and my woman a dress
And to catch me if I fall, I bought my mother a net, let's go

[Verse 3]
Anyone could get knocked off, any bitch could get knocked up
Baby daddy get locked up, sell everything, put the house up
Don't say anything, keep your mouth shut
Except two words and that's ""how much""
If I do get out, we're skippin' town
She said what about her mama
I paused
I said, ""I gotta do what I gotta
Is you gon' ride with me or you not?""
And she start cryin' and said, ""I'm not""
And I paused
I said, ""It's probably what's best
Well, I'll be back when pigs fly
So they can't follow me on my jet""
I tell my pilot where to go next
I bring that problem to your doorstep
I catch you slippin' while you tired
Like the road wet, like it's no sweat
I'm Tunechi, hi, I'm here to collect
They wondering why I ain't gettin' no rest
'Cause that's just too close to arrestin'
And too far from ""serve and protect""
So, Police, read me my wrongs, or just leave me alone
Rubbing, squinting my eyes, I still don't see where I'm wrong
Sold my soul to the streets, they bought it previously-owned
Went to jail for a Glock and soon as I got home
[Chorus]
I went and bought myself a 9 and that new MAC-11
You talk shit at 10:59 and make the news at 11
Bitch, I'm the wildest motherfucker on a team full of rebels
Young, wild motherfucker to a MILF, cougar, leopard

[Verse 4]
I'm a lion, motherfucker, to these hoes 'cause you can sweat a little
Euro my secret weapon like Mark, Jackson and Stephen
I see plain-clothes pigs and unmarked intrepids
My bitch believe what I say, I told her salt was pepper
I'm cold as malts and metals, sell stolen parts, whatever
Put three holes in your head like a bowling ball, don't spare 'em
And all my niggas in jail, that's bullshit, I smell ya
Remember Destiny's Child? My favorite one was Farrah, man

[Chorus]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
I know you don't want war like you just a cadet
Tell a motherfucker who next, ""Motherfucker, you next""
I'm the best rapper alive and they love me to death, bye

[Outro]

Oh, you ain't heard?
Him and dopeman ain't cool no more
'Cause dopeman tried to charge him double for the usual
Damn
You just don't hear good news no more
After I tell this story, I gotta kill who I told
Okay, his new package had came in
Had the whole house stankin'
Traphouse doorbell ringin'
Traphouse gettin' too famous
His traphouse poppin' all night
The porch light should be strobe lights
That shit them police don't like
You know them pigs no good like pork rinds
Gotta go home to that whore wife
That don't never wan' fuck, just start fights
And he just made a hard right at the wrong time
They pulled him over, if they only write him a ticket, he'll be alright
Yeah, right
‘Cause you know he fit the description of a black male that sell white
AK on the backseat
Trunk full of cocaína
He stepped on the gas and got ghost on 'em
His bitch scream like she seen one
He said, “Shut up while I speed up”
She said, “I think you lost 'em,"" now he think he lost 'em
Now he lost his train of thought
The voice in his head said, “All aboard”
And he woke up, don't listen to that bitch
She coked up off of his stuff
And he know it's good
Where the popcorn? This story good, call Hollywood
But anyway, let a nigga get back to it
He came to a neighborhood and he zig-zagged through it
He didn't see the lights, but he still heard the sirens
Cut off all his lights and they drove right by him, woo
Chapter two
Traphouse just got cable
Stuntin' on the neighbors
The cable man was the feds though
A four-year-old was in bed though
He woke up when he heard the Glocks cock
You wouldn't believe what happened ten seconds later
To be continued, dot, dot, dot

Ten seconds left, he gon' get it
Mag in his mouth, mean like a fitted
Caught him in the pool room, two to his head
In the room and boom, they did it, wow
Face on the ground, Ace of Spade on the ground
Run, bullets, they'll chase you around
Don't listen to me, these niggas ain't playin'
Yo, they'll lace 'em down, feel it
One hit Willy
Other nigga live with a milli
Other nigga ride him Phillies
Run through the hood, all blood, blowin' bills on grils
Just chillin' up in New York City
One got witty
Took his mask off, he a dumbass
Got him on viddy
Somebody yelled out, “Yo, that's 'Chelle”
Blaow, blaow, caught her in the titty, huh
Four more shells went to his face like gazelles
Bloody, they laced him up well
Niggas stop shootin', get the loot
Stop bullshittin', boy, you wild, stop playin' yourself
This ain't good, now they fucked
Police barricade the buildin', what?
Now we stuck
Now this clown-ass nigga just fucked us all up (Up)
Eleven more shots
Came to the door was the cops
Chain popped off, caught him in his top
Fell to the floor, damn four-year-old shorty just looked up
Said, “They got you”
Damn, another nigga dead
Another nigga head licked, damn, they copped out
What's it all about, kid?
Max out, shed, play the background, we's out
Mwah
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
There's always more to the story (To the story)
There's always more to the story
You ain't hear it from me (Hear it from me)
And what you hear, don't repeat (Don't repeat)
Or disappear in your sleep
And you ain't hear this from me (This from me)
There's always more to the story (To the story)

The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin' (I ain't chasin')
'Cause only in still water we can see our faces (See our faces)
Real shit, I told my nigga

[Verse 1]
""Boy, you better watch them hoes when you sleepin'
Nigga, them dog-ass hoes be creepin'""
I got a few Ms put up for safe keepin'
Long hair, don't care like I was raised in a teepee
Nigga, gun hurt, Nina said she 'bout to go streakin'
Niggas 'bout to go to missin', niggas 'bout to go to deacons
Niggas 'bout to get high as airmen from Tuskegee
Niggas blind to the fact 'cause they don't wan' see me
Niggas don't want talk, niggas don't want reason
Niggas don't want peace, niggas don't know the meanin'
Nigga said, ""You're a bitch, nigga,"" bitch European
Nigga, we Herculean, nigga, skate, surf, or skiin'
Nigga really overseeing, y'all niggas sight seein'
Tomorrow is what a nigga ain't guaranteein'
New Orleans had a sheriff by the name of Harry Lee
And when he died, niggas shouted out, ""Tha-thank you, Jesus""
Cruising down the street and I ain't Caribbean
Ain't terrified and I ain't never been
Sippin' H-Town, lookin' like Jeremy Lin
I'm movin' slower than a fuckin' Maryland terrapin
I ain't got time, patience very thin
I will fuck a nigga bride on the day she marry him
I'm a bad Samaritan, I'm a black American
Got white like a fuckin' Aryan, and

Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no

[Verse 2]
Now beam me up Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With ""Stop snitchin'"" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the '90s, my dope ain't consignment
My coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
These hoes be relying, these niggas be lying
These niggas who snitchin' we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifyin', you know desert's quiet
So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizin'
You cuddle too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie, ""I know where to find him""
He said, ""You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor""
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a Chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
Call me the greatest or call me retired
It's up in the air like carbon monoxide
Bitch, we in the buildin', we started from outside
My dick is my third eye and she call it cockeyed
My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360
She get so wet, it can be sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F you, with a sick dick
Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick
Playin' my role, even with a thick script
Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip
Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift
Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip
Anything can happen, put the whats with the ifs
But what's with the ifs?
Just pass that weed like flyin' colors
Light green, teal, turquoise, purple
When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk
I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal
Papa was a rolling stone, worthless
Mama said I wasn't on purpose
That's why I got a ice box where
My heart used to be in this cold world
I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster
I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, GRAMMYs, Oscars
Knock you off your fuckin' high horse
Like a cold-blooded jouster, fightin' for my life
Praying to the ringside announcer
[Refrain]
It's so simple that it's complicated (Complicated), yeah
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em (When you made 'em), yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin' (I ain't chasin')

She looked me in my eyes
And then said the next dick she'd take
Would be her husband's dick, damn
See, I had the steak, she had the lobster
I say, ""I want you on my team,"" she say, ""I don't join rosters""
""Oh, believe that,"" and then the drinks came
And then the mood changed and then her answer switched
She let her hair down and lit a cancer stick
She saw it turned me off and said she tryna quit
She went to the ladies room and I hopped on my phone
Most likely she doin' the same thing

And see, I had the shrimp, she had the pasta
She said she don't like rappers, we got something in common
I said, ""Especially that nigga Wayne""
We both laughed and then the wine came

I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust these bitches
Haters praying for my downfall, at least they're religious
People in Hell, they want rainfall, your bitch just want these digits
I feel like I'm on her payroll how she pay my ass a visit
We put both iPhones on silent, both iPhones on silent
I only answer for my niggas, careful with that dialogue
Man, my house ain't got no house phone
My flip phone is a chip phone
Got a prepaid and that bitch on, but still, I use my bitch phone
'Cause I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust my SIM card
I got Siri talkin' dirty to me, tryna make my dick hard
I got Tunechi on my ringtonе, my children on my home screen
I choke you with thе phone charger
Sold more crack than my phone screen, let's go
Fur floor mats, I'm bare feet, nigga
100K a week, that's a bad week, nigga
I can sell dogs to a cat freak, nigga
Sell monkey bars to a chimpanzee, nigga
But you never know what you never know
Nigga sell you coke and it wasn't coke
Hang 'em off the building and let 'em go
That's how you make a statement that they should quote
I seen death around the corner
And I lived right by the corner store
I'm a hot boy, I'll burn your hand
I'm a real life Untouchable
I run the show, I run the show
Sell anything but my soul
And I'm prayin' that the only cuffs
That touch my wrist come with button holes, for real
Smokin' on the good
Killin' these hoes like Blair Underwood
Rest in peace to my daddy Rabbit, I swear to his lucky foot
Ever since he died of jealousy, I've been looking for a cure
You see, my daddy had that work, now they watch his son get to it
And just like he ran them streets, I run with bulls
If niggas buyin' I throw out some numbers to 'em
Numbers soundin' yummy to 'em
You need more, just call my ho, I gave her phone number to 'em

When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

[Refrain]
I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me
Keepin' my two fingers crossed, but I'm still lookin' for peace
I been lookin' at the clouds, maybe they'll listen to me
Can't talk dirty to myself because the mirror's too clean
Tryin' never to look back because the light always green
It's safe to say I lost my way, but I never lost the lead

[Chorus]
And if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

[Verse 1]
Every time it beat, it break apart
I really think it's all my daddy fault
I can't find the keys to my heart
Think I'ma need the automatic start
Out there lookin' for love after dark
Then I get tired and it's an afterthought
Where's the love? Five question marks
Eat your heart out, I had to starve
It's the saddest part
I'm questionin' myself, I ain't gotta answer yours
Baby, that's for sure
I take a look at myself and then I just pass the torch
Baby, back and forth
I ask can we get together just to break back apart
Baby, that's the cure
Me, myself, I, my iPhone, Fantastic Four
Never knew 'take it or leave it' could be so literal
Never knew takin' a breather could be so physical
Never knew takin' it easy could be so difficult
Never knew takin' these drugs could be so spiritual
Never knew the chemist like how I know the chemicals
Never knew takin' a life could be so minuscule
Never know takin' chances will be individual
Never know takin' advantage would be inhospitable, how pivotal
Never knew the shit I never knew would be minimal, how cynical
Never knew love and hate were similar, identical

I can't find the keys to this life
Picked the locks, I might be a'ight
Close my eyes, I might see the light
Life is a bitch, she might be my type
Death is a bitch, she might be tonight
Haters kiss and dick-eaters bite
Tables turn every day 'n night
Three-sixty, three-sixty-five
I can't find no leaks to my pipe
Police can't find nor reason nor right
Been tryna let shit happen on the fly
But I can't find a seat on that flight
There's a private plane, that's simple and plain
Tickets at a more reasonable price
Sometimes, I don't know how it's gon' end
Even though I done seen the movie twice
Pop a wheelie, new motorbike
Some people like to live a slower life
Some niggas like to live cutthroat
I'ma be the nigga that hold the knife
You girl wan' hold me tight over night
Who am I to tell her wrong from right?
I'ma give her more dick than advice
You give her more strings to a kite
I just found a needle in a haystack, bitch, it's payback
I found myself talkin' to myself with nothin' to say back
And I just found the keys to a Maybach I had way back
Tryna find everything but my way back
[Chorus]
Yeah, well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
I been lookin' at my posse with a look of belief
I been lookin' my closet and it look like Paris
They been lookin' for your body, they been lookin' for weeks
They find you dead with your eyes open, lookin' for grief

[Outro]
I been lookin' at the clouds, they say they look up to me
Safe to say I lost some sleep, but I never lost my dreams
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep

Actin' like they killers, but them niggas just some hoes
We act like this a studio, this really just a trap
Everything we got, we had to whip it out the bowl
Before we shake your hand, we'd rather slap you with the strap
A million cash in hunnids, now they bring it to the door (Racks)
20k for a coat that I ain't even wore
This bitch so bad, I let her shop, I made 'em close the store
She think she trickin' me, but bitch don't know my pockets swole (The money)
Big bankroll, top floor South Beach (Top)
Long money Gucci, ask your bitch 'bout me (Ask)
Penthouse suite, four hoes, two weeks
And all my shooters shootin; .223's 'bout me, Wop

Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads, ""Don’t cry, stay tuned""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife

And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll (Let 'em drop and roll)
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise141Embed"

""If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be""
""You tatted your face—""
Bugatti, new boo
""You screamed, 'Suu whoop'—""
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
""You bought a Bugatti—"", so you can flex
""And most of the bad bitches your ex""
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo, new subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs, much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move, two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you? Two middle fingers that's up high to whom it may consume
Kaboom, goddamn, who knew that I am the guru with voodoo that sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man, and see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam, sit back and watch, and do not watch your watch hand, give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man, I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock, but it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man, I do what I can to keep it solid as a-- you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
""You tatted your face and changed the culture"" (You changed)
""You screamed, 'Suu whoop,' and them gangsters loved you"" (Yeah, yeah)
""You bought a Bugatti so you could flex"" (So you can flex)

Go retarded as shit, you go sweet, tangy, I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, they borrowed this shit, I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit, put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched, the orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile, I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit in the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit 'bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit

Control your mind, mind freak, no sober mind, I'm so behind

And if you gettin' out of line, I hang you with a clothin' line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line

Rough edges like a box of Checkers fries, that's a line

They could do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma take me to a space shuttle
Say, now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who? I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gon' break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you

As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted
[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love

Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him"" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothing, keep resting,""
She say, ""What's missing?""—""How you know something missing?""
He scratched his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,""
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, ""Ooh""

I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,""
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me a salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier!""
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
For a minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,""
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ""Ooh,"" dead emotion (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture

Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?
See Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter
[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that.17Embed"

I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, ""Oh my God""
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, ""Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me""

Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer: ""Don't let me make these bitches famous""
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, ""Can you look this way? Can you look this way?""

Belly button, big ol' titties, she pop buttons, head buttin'

My hand in the psychic's hand, she see righteous plans
I see business plans then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, ""Oooh, Lordy,"" smellin' like Cool Water

That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley

Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I’m dope, nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em—it's that ""Carter V,"" let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin’ every winter
And as long as I’m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I’m not a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin’, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up

Yeah, I grew up around dope niggas and cold killers
And most niggas was both, nigga, two sport niggas
I was no different from those niggas, but I was chose, nigga
See those niggas saw more in me than these hoes, nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach, nigga
Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system
For that bitch who played her role with ya and those children
I ain't lyin', slime, all my niggas balling, it's a fuckin' team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga—get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up
Sittin’ on this money to me feel like a cactus

Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety

'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Smoke one, ready to po' one, tote one, scared of no one
You never know when your close ones is a pussy 'til your nose run
Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happiest goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like ""let's play,"" lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm

Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?
Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras
Extra ready for my presents, extra sexy but she selfish
Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelmin'
Talkin' money over salmon in Italian in Australia
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, comin' from what's comin' at ya
I come from where they come at ya, in a way you can't come back from
I attack from every crack, while you been chillin', I been active

Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas, see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

[Bridge]
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
She agree to my demands too
Brought the demon out her ass too
I'm a demon, I demand you

I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 1]
She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning

Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero
Man in the mirror, my 'migo
Crème de la crème de la Créole
Couple a cracks in the mirror
Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died
[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya

Yeah, yeah
Mmm...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 1]
Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, ""Why you leave your shit here?""
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, ""Pray""
She say, ""I need a day"", I said, ""I need a bae""
She said, ""Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way""
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, ""Let go my arm!""

Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can hear them pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out
[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, ""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet
[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]
Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
Let it all work out (Phew)
""Let it all work out""
(But he said, ""Remember this:"")
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""And don't forget what I did this, bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch"")
""Let it all—""
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""Now I'm out this bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""I'm out this bitch"")
""Let it all—""

Ah...
O—OK

[Verse]
I got this chrome on this Bugatti, I'm strong in this Bugatti
Two V8s, ain't no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti
Bitch, I’m bad, I'm worse, I'll pass the purp
Don't fuck with me 'cause right now, I'm higher than Captain Kirk
I swear, I be the sickest nigga, you can ask the nurse
And if you throw it in a bag I bet I'll snatch her purse
OK, I spaz, I curse; you last, I'm first
I'm on your ass, like dirt; behind that cash, get murked
I'm talking big shit, nigga, join my hit list, nigga
What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss, nigga
Shoot the witness, nigga
Hold court in the streets and convict this nigga
Ol' dickless nigga
Man, I'm running with the blocka, Young Money, motherfucker
You think we gon' do our thing? Well, ain't it sunny in the summer?
And we coming for the commas, and whoever among us
And you know I'ma bust my ass until my crew very humongous
I said, T.I., hold your head, and Mack, hold your head
Wish I could but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds
And to my Bloods, code red, man, you know how we play it
And if it costs to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay
I—I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit
Take the brain off the whip; now, it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promised tomorrow
Now, women kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra
Fuq' roll them killer plants, the Little Shop of Horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make 'em look like Toccara
Man, I'm too much for these niggas and three much for these hoes
The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed
I love my baby mamas, they get my highest honor
Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard
Quarterback, shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards
Bitch, I ball hard, breaking all the backboards
Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdie these balls
In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls
Man, I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers, ugh
Now, get off my dick, I ain't fucking with you
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Redbone do me good, then her friend assist her
I mean, a bitch she never met, her best friend, or sister
I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho
Bullet in you boys' memory, now you act like you don't know
Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But Heaven or Hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'ma go
Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still ""long hair, don't care"" like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
I smash this verse, and I swag and surf

Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
President, got 'em in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it say, ""Right now""
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panatela Dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money, baby, big shit, like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti, matte black—""Where they do that at?""
South Beach Miami, ho, I'm probably with Tammy To'
My life is a video and the women want they cameo
I just want them pantyhose, and I’m higher than Ger-an-imo
And I got them tools, tell them boys it could get mechanical
Now, pop that pussy like a four-four
I turn you 'round and bend you over like a low blow
It’s Young Money, baby, we the fucking greatest
We done put them other niggas on a hiatus
Beat your bitch with the pump if she deny data
'Cause I’ll serve anyone like a blind waiter
I make my girl cum first; then, I arrive later
I shake you pussies up, I'm a vibrator, haha!
G—Getting money like, ""Hell yeah""
This shit so good, it don’t even smell bad
And you can tell Dad that I’m a motherfucker
You niggas bet' not slip—Ice Road Truckers
Light-pole barrel, chopper stupid-long
New Orleans nigga, I get super-dome
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me, ha!
We on, nigga; let—let them hoes know
Young Money lay 'em down like old folks
You coming with it? We coming for it
Plenty to go around—now, watch the money orbit
Real shit, people; now, just absorb it
I tried to pay attention, but y'all mad boring
And I got so much swag, I need an ad for it
And I don’t like to brag, so my bitches brag for me
Oh, she a good girl? I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it ""global warming""
If we gon' do it, dog, let's do it now
I—I—I am more animal than the zoo allow
Put me in the wild, I’ll be there for a while
You niggas Little League, call 'em Curaçao
Energizer money: it keep going
I’m laid up, I’m free-throwing
Who rebounding? Who gives a shit?
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your missus
You are local news; I’m 60 Minutes
I—I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office—guess I’m fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still icing out crosses—keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it

OK, you doing your thing? Well, things change

Then take a female to the Island
Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas
I'm fucking her friends
Now her friends ain't even fucking with her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off she ain't even spelling shit right
I text her back, and tell her it's life
Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night

OK, No Ceilings, motherfucker, good morning
Dick in your mouth while you're yawning, I'm going in
Gudda, why they started me? Marley, why they started me?
I bring it to your front door like you ordered me
Back in this bitch, but a lot more rich
On my Papa Bear shit, need hot porridge
Got a lot more shit than you can ever fathom
A big-head nigga couldn’t even imagine
The shit I do, most doers never done
I'ma fuck this beat, you bitch, ooh, you better cum
Bet I run this shit, I don't run from shit
I still b-beat your ass like a fucking drumstick
Weezy Fucking Baby, baby, make the ladies come quick
The money can’t fit in my pockets, but I'll bet that gun fit
And I’m so unfit 'cause all I eat is rappers
And these rappers ain't shit, I like my fast food faster
Syrup got me slow like a turtle 'round this ho
And I'm flyer than the highest-flying bird around this ho
What's the word around this ho? You get served around this ho
Yeah, you get served like a fucking hors d'œuvre around this ho
I don’t splurge around no ho, no, I don’t shine in front of no bitch
'Cause after she get off my dick, I be like ""Find the front door, bitch""
I don't know why in the fuck your bitch keep coming by
I done fucked your bitch a hundred times
What the fuck your bitch got on her mind? My fucking dick
I call her ""dickhead,"" spicy like a Big Red
Strike you like a Bic head—your flow sick? My shit dead
Sillier than V.I.C. said, Soulja Boy and Arab
You should see my eleven-year-old daughter do they dance
I call it the Nae-Nae dance, proud to be Nae-Nae’s dad
Gun on the waistline, leave you in the wasteland
We are not the same, I am a Martian, this is Space Jam

Stop letting the messy hoes mess with your business

I—I—I do me; no, I do three
At a T... I-M-E
Why, when we say we Young Mula
The bitches leave y'all and relay-run to us
And payday comes sooner than later 'round here
And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mac, and Nina debate around there, yeah
You see it in my face, I don’t care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there
I'm the best thing yet, I know I got that thing wet
Everybody wan' be fly but don’t know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute
Now, I'm right back in it, like the drawers of the women
On a scale of one to ten-n, my girl be a twenty
My girl so bad, make a nigga think he sinnin'
My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me
Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies
All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E

And my girls be half-naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been riding
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stunting, but no, I'm just surviving
And I been here, but my soul is just arriving
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribing
Medication free, and for meditation, we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft, and bring the whammys back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami, though
I act so New Orl-e-ans, yes, I go pistachios
That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me
And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me

KE on the Track
No Ceilings
Ah...
O—OK

[Verse]
I got this chrome on this Bugatti, I'm strong in this Bugatti
Two V8s, ain't no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti
Bitch, I’m bad, I'm worse, I'll pass the purp
Don't fuck with me 'cause right now, I'm higher than Captain Kirk
I swear, I be the sickest nigga, you can ask the nurse
And if you throw it in a bag I bet I'll snatch her purse
OK, I spaz, I curse; you last, I'm first
I'm on your ass, like dirt; behind that cash, get murked
I'm talking big shit, nigga, join my hit list, nigga
What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss, nigga
Shoot the witness, nigga
Hold court in the streets and convict this nigga
Ol' dickless nigga
Man, I'm running with the blocka, Young Money, motherfucker
You think we gon' do our thing? Well, ain't it sunny in the summer?
And we coming for the commas, and whoever among us
And you know I'ma bust my ass until my crew very humongous
I said, T.I., hold your head, and Mack, hold your head
Wish I could but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds
And to my Bloods, code red, man, you know how we play it
And if it costs to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay
I—I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit
Take the brain off the whip; now, it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promised tomorrow
Now, women kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra
Fuq' roll them killer plants, the Little Shop of Horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make 'em look like Toccara
Man, I'm too much for these niggas and three much for these hoes
The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed
I love my baby mamas, they get my highest honor
Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard
Quarterback, shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards
Bitch, I ball hard, breaking all the backboards
Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdie these balls
In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls
Man, I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers, ugh
Now, get off my dick, I ain't fucking with you
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Redbone do me good, then her friend assist her
I mean, a bitch she never met, her best friend, or sister
I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho
Bullet in you boys' memory, now you act like you don't know
Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But Heaven or Hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'ma go
Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still ""long hair, don't care"" like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
I smash this verse, and I swag and surf

Ha...
Take it, FATBOI
No Ceilings
Ugh

[Verse]
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
President, got 'em in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it say, ""Right now""
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panatela Dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money, baby, big shit, like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti, matte black—""Where they do that at?""
South Beach Miami, ho, I'm probably with Tammy To'
My life is a video and the women want they cameo
I just want them pantyhose, and I’m higher than Ger-an-imo
And I got them tools, tell them boys it could get mechanical
Now, pop that pussy like a four-four
I turn you 'round and bend you over like a low blow
It’s Young Money, baby, we the fucking greatest
We done put them other niggas on a hiatus
Beat your bitch with the pump if she deny data
'Cause I’ll serve anyone like a blind waiter
I make my girl cum first; then, I arrive later
I shake you pussies up, I'm a vibrator, haha!
G—Getting money like, ""Hell yeah""
This shit so good, it don’t even smell bad
And you can tell Dad that I’m a motherfucker
You niggas bet' not slip—Ice Road Truckers
Light-pole barrel, chopper stupid-long
New Orleans nigga, I get super-dome
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me, ha!
We on, nigga; let—let them hoes know
Young Money lay 'em down like old folks
You coming with it? We coming for it
Plenty to go around—now, watch the money orbit
Real shit, people; now, just absorb it
I tried to pay attention, but y'all mad boring
And I got so much swag, I need an ad for it
And I don’t like to brag, so my bitches brag for me
Oh, she a good girl? I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it ""global warming""
If we gon' do it, dog, let's do it now
I—I—I am more animal than the zoo allow
Put me in the wild, I’ll be there for a while
You niggas Little League, call 'em Curaçao
Energizer money: it keep going
I’m laid up, I’m free-throwing
Who rebounding? Who gives a shit?
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your missus
You are local news; I’m 60 Minutes
I—I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office—guess I’m fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still icing out crosses—keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F. Baby, the ""F"" is for ""Forensics""
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
OK, you doing your thing? Well, things change
You plain-Jane, I’m diverse
I save the world second, and I get high first
I’m a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch, I bring the noise where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like Grandma pussy
I’m always good, like Grandma cookies
Yeah, call me the spleen or the spine fixer
It's going down like the Catalina Wine Mixer
She going down like the hands on my time-ticker
I’m always strapped—Vietnam, nigga
We are fine, nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball, nigga, like Jalen Rose
Better tell them hoes, I got a million flows
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes
Young Money, baby, and the building grows
As we look up—where did the ceilings go?

OK, No Ceilings, motherfucker, good morning
Dick in your mouth while you're yawning, I'm going in
Gudda, why they started me? Marley, why they started me?
I bring it to your front door like you ordered me
Back in this bitch, but a lot more rich
On my Papa Bear shit, need hot porridge
Got a lot more shit than you can ever fathom
A big-head nigga couldn’t even imagine
The shit I do, most doers never done
I'ma fuck this beat, you bitch, ooh, you better cum
Bet I run this shit, I don't run from shit
I still b-beat your ass like a fucking drumstick
Weezy Fucking Baby, baby, make the ladies come quick
The money can’t fit in my pockets, but I'll bet that gun fit
And I’m so unfit 'cause all I eat is rappers
And these rappers ain't shit, I like my fast food faster
Syrup got me slow like a turtle 'round this ho
And I'm flyer than the highest-flying bird around this ho
What's the word around this ho? You get served around this ho
Yeah, you get served like a fucking hors d'œuvre around this ho
I don’t splurge around no ho, no, I don’t shine in front of no bitch
'Cause after she get off my dick, I be like ""Find the front door, bitch""
I don't know why in the fuck your bitch keep coming by
I done fucked your bitch a hundred times
What the fuck your bitch got on her mind? My fucking dick
I call her ""dickhead,"" spicy like a Big Red
Strike you like a Bic head—your flow sick? My shit dead
Sillier than V.I.C. said, Soulja Boy and Arab
You should see my eleven-year-old daughter do they dance
I call it the Nae-Nae dance, proud to be Nae-Nae’s dad
Gun on the waistline, leave you in the wasteland
We are not the same, I am a Martian, this is Space Jam
No Ceilings, R.I.P., Amen
Motherfucking caveman, beating on my chest
Young Money, Cash Money, and I'm eating all the rest
Nigga, no offense, sorry if you're offended
Riding high like I'm on 54 inches
Man, I'd rather chill with 54 bitches
Ch—Chill like— Ch—Chill like an Eskimo
L—Let's get more— Let's get more bitches
And I be like, ""Let's get more bitches""
Mr. Officer, stop arresting your bitches
Stop letting the messy hoes mess with your business
Mickey Mouse cheese, hip-hop Walt Disney
Sheesh, gosh, Oshkosh B’gosh
Smoking on that Bob Marley, listening to Pete Tosh
I—I—I do me; no, I do three
At a T... I-M-E
Why, when we say we Young Mula
The bitches leave y'all and relay-run to us
And payday comes sooner than later 'round here
And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mac, and Nina debate around there, yeah
You see it in my face, I don’t care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there
I'm the best thing yet, I know I got that thing wet
Everybody wan' be fly but don’t know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute
Now, I'm right back in it, like the drawers of the women
On a scale of one to ten-n, my girl be a twenty
My girl so bad, make a nigga think he sinnin'
My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me
Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies
All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E
Mic check, two-three; I am different like blue pee
And my girls be half-naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been riding
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stunting, but no, I'm just surviving
And I been here, but my soul is just arriving
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribing
Medication free, and for meditation, we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft, and bring the whammys back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami, though
I act so New Orl-e-ans, yes, I go pistachios
That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me
And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me

Nice tires on the 'Ghini, you should wanna king me
Brain-dead flow: vegetable, zucchini
I live on the beach; she walk around in her bikini
Girls are like school, and I cut ‘em like seniors
I’m here to distinguish the bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap—get some money in between it
Glocks like police, pumps like Finas
This beat getting totaled: Pam, Keisha, Kima
S—Sitting on the world, thinking 'bout a girl
Pistol on my side, paint you like a mural
Digged in my pocket, pulled out a party
Be cool 'fore you get stomped and pulled out the party
H—Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Looking for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big-bad-flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church, like a choir and a couple of old priestses
Elevator in my crib 'cause it's five floors

Straight up out of Texas and I’m major like Applewhite (Haha)
I pour four; then, I hit the exit door ('Bout to...)

I’m knocking hoes down like Laila (Who?) Ali (Yeah)
Try he, and I'ma put the toaster to your kidney (Uh-huh)
Then, I pull off in a Bentley, top open like a chimney (Goddamn!)

Bitch, I’m in the building, you just decorating
I’m just detonating, then I get blatant
More dangerous than internet dating
Scoob got the cameras on, so I gotta show off
I'll put your sister on, I'll knock your bro off
Weezy spit snowballs, catch it in your face bitch
Good-Game Wayne, man, I deserve a Naismith
Cook 'caine game flow, dope in the vein flow
I only be smoking the purple out the rainbow
Stronger than Drano, your boyfriend a lame-o
And if you stay with him, then y’all in the same boat
Deep-Water Carter, fishing for a dollar
You can join the salad, I’m splitting your tom-a-ta
Ball 'cause I gotta, you’ll love me in the morning
I told her I'm a king, them other niggas Prince Charming
She love to rock my mic, she say there's nothing like performing
Man, I'm in love with her grill, George Foreman
Forewarning: Young Money’s armed
And we can shoot it out, I got the money drawn
Yeah! Take that to the bank with you
I rock my hat to the side like I paint pictures
Smoke weed, talk shit, like Lane Kiffin
Whole country in recession, but Wayne different
Huh, and I’m a Maybach rider
Haven’t drove it one time, I got a cool Black driver
Can't walk around with guns, I got a dude that got 'em
Don’t worry if I'm shootin' as long as you don't get shot (Arms)

I’m up for whoever the opponent, nigga
Stop the track—let me relish in the moment, nigga
Now, bring that motherfucker back, 'cause I’m zoning, nigga
I go hard like Rafael Nadal
And if the bitches worth having, then I bet we have 'em all
And man, I'm so high, it's like an everlasting fall
And I’m charging these hoes like women basketball
Ugh! I bet that chopper get his mind right
Leave a hole in his chest like a lion bite
Superhero car, like I crime-fight
I see big cheese, you niggas blind mice
Ugh, T-Streets still roll with me
Still sticking to the script, like Nicole Kidman
Need the man hit? We are those hitmen
He stopped running; the bullet holes didn’t
Ugh, basically, I’m still a monster
'Til the fat lady sing—I come to kill a opera
Y'all too plain, I'm a helicopter
My words keep going, like a teleprompter
I’m a asshole—wipe me down, bitch
I get big checks—Niketown, bitch
Yeah, mean mug, Bobby Brown shit
And the flag red, like clown lips (Arms)

Wake her in the morning, breakfast where she slept at
Tell her, ""Go shopping""; I can't wait 'til she get back
Louis flip-flops and a pair of pink sweatpants
She wear that on my jet, I fuck her after jet lag
I take her to the vet 'cause she a bad bitch
You can't be broke and happy, so, me—I'm mad rich

And I don't pay for pussy, because her pussy priceless

But I weather the storm, I'm a lightning streak, ugh

Them crazy freaky bitches tryna Cirque du Soleil me
Got some new bitches, Trel got em' laughin'
The one that gave me head could suck the nail out a casket
Shotgun on the kitchen table, bullet shells in the cabinet
Fucking with me is like stepping on the tail of a dragon
Wet pussy is my cabin, more bitches than a pageant
I keep a house full, nigga—call me Bob Saget
Spending time backwards, hotter than a cactus
And we ain't in the building—we the fucking contractors

Quarterback Weezy, young Tom Brady
Open up your mouth, and catch a bomb, baby, haha!
Good morning, dude, Eagle-Street-Corner Tune
Long dough, no shortbread, no Lorna Doone
I'm warnin' you: We on the move
Bunch of female dogs and garden tools

So I brought some change to finish my load
I load millions and more millions

Step up in this bitch, five o'clock in the morning
The world is waking up, you can hear the pigeons yawning

Y'all niggas need a lesson, on some ethic—you gon' learn now
I do this for the love of it; saliva, 'cause I love to spit
And I juke it; for my future records y'all gon' love to spin
Fucking with my bred'ren, 10 years strong
And he put them dreads in: Silver, John Long
But he's more like platinum; hold up, here's a napkin
Pick your jaw up off the floor, and tuck your tongue right back in
Tell me, where is Mack Maine?

I deep stroke and make her bite her fist
The lights is on, the night is grown
We get it poppin' cause we know we can't when wifey home
California kush - strong as a Titan - is what I'm lightin' on
We get high as fuck then we ""Just Do It"" put your Nikes on
Tattoos on her waist, she like the tattoos on my face
And if there's something she'd like to say
I let her say it on my microphone
She love my style...but that's expected
She coming back to you? The chances anorexic
I knew she had it in her, so I got it out her
She give me neck around the clock: I call it ""round the Carter""
She rub my back, she say I'm tight
She cook, fuck and clean
And still make her flight!

[Intro]
(Glory)

[Verse 1]
Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on
I'm 'bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lamb', I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, ""cock-a-doodle""
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you (Glory)

I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-hoo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, ""Surprise,"" but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord
[Verse 3]
Am I talkin' crazy? Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, ""Be quiet, we need our privacy""
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, hook you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em
[Outro]
Glory, hallelujah (I got 'em)

‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on

Uh, I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except Heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my mama, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die the angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized
Lord, mama hate I got my daddy’s eyes
Never looked into my daddy’s eyes
He ain't have the time
Fuck him

I just hope my contribution will be memorized

Searching for better days before a better person

Just ask my bitch and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my head ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think

If you catch a feather, just keep it

Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing

I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like
Oh Lord, what are we running from?

Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t fuck with us

Weed and syrup, yeah
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse 1]
All I know is paper, I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap and pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon, it's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy, keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind, and bodies on my nine
And I swear every day, I'm on my Ariana grind-de
I got that yay, I got that la-di-da-di-da
And a kamikaze squad, and you chicken parmesan
Lord, I'm a free man like I come from Amistad
No, I come from Hollygrove, turnin' Os to octagons
I get money while I'm 'sleep, I dream that I'm in Heaven
I dream I saw Lil Beezy and smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, rest in peace, and my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep, they catch him when he least expect 'em
Mama told me ""If you run these streets, run these streets correctly""
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows I wear new clothes to the mall
Two hoes on my arm
Fur boots when it's warm
Church shoes to play ball
I'm spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper, I don't love these hoes
Boy, that vest won't save you, neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him, better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord, all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy 'cause they been sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zeros
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord, all I know is paper, big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is, that bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience 'til I heard ""All aboard""
They mad 'cause I be skatin' at home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5K
I be spendin' 25K every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
'Cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house, bae
Plus we need the kitchen
Lord, trap house in abundance

Hol' up, had to switch the flow up
Had to pour up, roll some more up
Watch me go up, my doors go up
When I show up, why you show up?
Pick my bro up, pick a O up
Hit the store up, get a soda
Get us four cups, split a four up
Then we slow up, yeah, you know us
Then we toast cups and we post up
Don't approach us, we got toasters
That's my slime, like we ghostbust
And we both bust, give no fucks
Take no stuff and take your stuff
Then ho hunt for some chocha
I know a ho who'll rock the boat
But I row her, I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita, I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimeters
Oh Lord, I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms, he died recent
So I hope Heaven made more room for him, and I hope he see me

And such and such killed such and such
The streets talk and bullshit walks on crutches, but
It's strut to strut
Niggas panic
Button pressing
The end is coming
Count your blessings
We living in the day and time
Where the ten commandments
Are now suggestions
How depressing
How infested
Click-clack, pow, intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies
I found the crevice
AK bullets move mountains
Break them bitches down to pebbles
That tough talk is like music to my ears
So keep it a capella
Based on a true story
We not worried, y'all too worried
I faced my fears and told them motherfuckers y'all too gorgeous
Dread head from New Orleans
Where the youth, them got two choices
Shoot, or get shot, or a nigga choose for you
We murdered them

First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Yo, Tune point and I'm dusting niggas
I ain't talking lacing no marijuana
Soon as I hatched, I reigned like a quail
And gave two fucks, I ain't a koala
My uncle gangsta, but I make him nervous
All he see in my face is murder
Waste a burner is my waste a furnace
I pace and turn and she'll face the thermos
First birthday wish was getting caked up
Shoot a nigga, wake up on the wake-up
Lay down in a model bitch A-cup
Then I put pearls in a bitch like Jacob
Play tough, tape off of this tape-up
Race off like some motherfuckin' makeup
Take off, looking for something to take up
Get the paper or you goin' in the paper?
Not horoscopes, but in the horror scope
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope
They gave my nigga thirty for a jar of dope
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap
Blowing so much, you sneezing dick
Believe in me, I don't believe in shit
Y'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip
It's Young Money 'til I'm in the freezer stiff, bitch
[Chorus: Junior Reid]
First degree murder
Beg them nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

[Verse 3: N.O. Capo]
It's all about the money, nigga, fuck the fame
Where we come from, shots ring, nigga, broad day
Lil' woadie said he had a chance, he'd do this shit again
Poppin' pills for the pain, but still won't feel a thing
It's deeper than this rap, I'm in the back soaking game
Cartier frames got 'em looking at me strange
Why pre mostly heard and I'm rarely sane
Low-key can still get a brick off my name
Now I'ma tell you this here for my youngin 'nem
The same ones I hung the corners with, do numbers with
If it ever was a problem, watch 'em pull up quick
Caught an L sticking to the script, you know I switched
We now switch

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

Uh, hundred thousand on a small ass chain
Hundred thousand on a bottle champagne
Half a million for a watch with no diamonds
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the backyard
Elevator in the house, never got stuck
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck
I just looked at your bitch and got eye-fucked
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up
All you see is license plates far in front of ya
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life
She licked her lips twice and told me that I'm yummier
Glass house on the block, five floors in it
Got a picture on the wall that cost more than it
You observing it, I'm absorbing it
Judge mad 'cause a nigga make more than him
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims
I'm going in 'til I'm pouring in more than M's
I'm courtin' swimsuit models that don't know who I am
And foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films
My warrant's clear as day like Doris is
When I ain't trippin' then my lawyers is
So what the charges is?
Put it on my tab, baller shit
I'm from the cell to the mall with this

[Verse 2]
Uh, one time
For the hustlers and the young moms
My presidential said it's crunch time
Looking in my son's eyes
Only time I see a upside
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy
Never be a punchline
Tell him never wait in one line
Tell him not even a lunch line
Pray more than sometimes
When the cops come, you tongue-tied
Take dirt, make a mud pie
Lookin' out the window
In the coupe with a bimbo
Talking 'bout who she resemble
Bitch, you in a Enzo
Stop being so simple
Now fuck me like we in a limo
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill
I got ocean views, I got water bills
I got cards to deal, I got hearts to steal
I got larger wheels on my automobile
I lost appeal
The bullshit cost me a mill
It brought me to tears
I came home and bought me a crib
I walk through that bitch
Strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge
I started to swig
But end up drinking all of that shit
'Cause I deserve it, I be working hard for all of this shit
I step into a Rolls Royce when I walk out the pen

My pockets look Keloid
My dead Presidents reborn
When I'm naked, I got three arms
Got a big house with a green lawn
Got a cigar full of neon
Like my ho cold and my tea warm
Close his casket, he look deformed
I got bitches on my dick

[Verse 2: Euro]
I got Jays at my door
I got shooters on my team
I got Feds down my throat
Counting money, dirty and clean
Smoking nothing but Irene
Got a bitch with good hygiene
I'm sick with it, no vaccine

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got coke under my nails
I got niggas taking them Ls
Nigga, we don't need no scale
I'm sick with it, no get well
Trigga man, trigga man, trigga man, please don't shoot

When she fucking with me, it's a new experience
Fucking with you it's a new excuse

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Nigga, who is you?
I looked in the mirror, say ""Ooh, it's you""
All my goons be too enthused
So don't open your mouth like you're chewing glue
Light blue Michael Jordans, my shoe get checks like ""Swoosh""
Hear you niggas talking about what you gon' do or might do
I invite you, I entice you, but I advise you not to
God bless you like ""Achoo""
Police find you in the bayou
With your friends by you and your shit knocked loose
Nigga, that's what you'll get like Ken and Ryu

So you know what you can do?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga, pull up

Read a scripture out your movie, get a picture, I'm a-zoomin
I'ma hit 'em, I'ma lose 'em, I'ma kill 'em, I'ma bruise 'em
I'm a sinner, I'm a suitor, not to mention I'm a mover

They see the guns we pull out, say ""Never mind"" and keep goin'

And we are what she want

Livin'

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Nigga, that's me in that nice-ass house
Butt-naked bitch with a nice ass
Walkin' 'round saying, ""You got a nice-ass house""
My phone keep ringin' though, my bad
I think my girl got me on spy cam now
My homies call cocaine ""white trash""
Charge you double just to take my trash out
I cannot fuck wit' you, bitch, 'cause you gon' get a nigga busted
Worryin' 'bout the wrong things while I'm hustlin'
Put the dick up in your mouth while it's runnin'
Bitch, don't ask no questions
Soon as I heard this, a young nigga killed it
'Cause I go too hard, I eat beats, mmm, scrumptious, delicious
Shoot you in your kidneys
I hope you see blood when you pissin'
We run up in your house on Christmas
And don't ask no questions
Just shoot whoever's present
While they open their presents
Oh please, Lord, forgive me
I just talked to my Reverend
Asked him if I'm the Devil
He said, ""That's these bitches""
See, I'm from New Orleans, that bitch is infested
Shootouts like the Westerns
Kill you and your bestie
Pay niggas to do it correctly
Two Ninas, they lesbians
I gotta shoot you with both or else one'd get jealous
I make money, not exceptions
Take pills like breath mints
She just get dick and refreshments
Free all my dogs in corrections
We all we got, don't need extras
We don't expect shit
We don't get mad over pussy
I'm probably lyin' in some pussy
While fools out here dyin' over pussy
And that's what I don't understand

Standin' on the top, I got a
Lot of observations
Young nigga, lot of options
You, you
Runnin' through a check
Buyin' all the champagne, blowin' up the net
And settin' all the trends, showin' niggas what's next
I was drinkin' coffee, smokin' weed on the jet
Probably wit' your wifey in the back for pillow talk
But we ain’t talkin', gettin' top while ain't no top
Swear to God, I had a chopper
Now the gun biz are the friends hoppin' out a helicopter
I be rollin' up the doctor's wishes
Countin' up the money, kickin' out the bitches
'Cause they all up on you, but be gone when it get real
Bitches ain't shit but a brick through your windshield
Shows in the evening, business meetings in the morning
(Ho)
Goons on deck, don't make a nigga sick 'em on ya
(Go, go, go)
Niggas talkin' shit, gon' make a nigga get pneumonia
Wrist so cold, think it's sick and got Ebola
Crib so big, got a bitch in every corner
Joint smoke good 'cause I showed her how to roll it
In the morning, I got meetings with my lawyer
Arguments I'll never be a part of
Love pussy and some good conversation
And that money, we'll never see a shortage
Nigga run up on me, he gon' be a goner

I gotta do it big, that's just how I do things

My homie got the pistol and he might spazz out
Lifespan, motherfuckin' lifespan
That shit all depend on how tonight pan out
Ooh, I swear these hoes ain't right man
I left my shady bitch, I got a nice tan now
Red bandana in my right pocket
So if I pull the trigger, I can wipe that down
I just put my gun up in her Coach bag
I won't hesitate to pull it right back out
Life coach? I don't need no life coach
To coach me through my motherfuckin' ups and downs
Tell a bitch don't ask no questions
My money so old, I tell my new money ""Respect your elders""
I'm startin' to get jealous of my own reflection
The young nigga sexy, a young nigga healthy
A young nigga flexin', I'm countin' my blessings
""Achoo,"" ""God bless me,"" ""Thank you,"" ""You're welcome""
I talked to my Reverend, asked him if there’s a Heaven
A Heaven for a G, because me and my Gangstas
Done done it all, but never tell
He say ""We already in Hell,"" I say ""Ain't that a bitch?""
'Cause I work too hard, but still thankful as if this shit came as a gift
I just pray for my niggas that's out here still slangin' that shit
Keep my distance, I can't take that risk
I hope they understand

And you could call me what you want
Just don't call me on speaker phone
And the good die young
And the great live forever
Go see your memory bank teller
'Cause you done forgot who put this shit together
Wait, bitch

Straight from the East side
Blood gang, we heavy
Fuck nigga, dare me
I turn into Freddy
My fingers machetes
Trap house jumpin' like Monta Ellis
We trap out the 'telly when we outta town
Uzi on deck
Phone ringin' off the hook, bitch, that's the plug
Ocean view bedroom, baby
See through showers and I just put some fish in my tub
Hold up, I ain't playin'
Niggas say they rich, I say ""And?""
Same old song, I ain't dance
Heater on my waist, hotter than a frying pan
If you don't see what I'm sayin'
I give your ass a fuckin' eye exam
I ain't playin'
Guns in my hands, I ain't prayin'
Fireman spittin' venom, Spiderman, I'm enhanced
I’m at peace, joggin' pants cost at least about a grand
I'm advanced like Japan
Got more sand than Sudan, Lord

[Bridge]
And life ain't nothin' but a long day
And tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way away
You know that haters come in all sizes, all shapes, 'kay
That's why I had to get a little more trunk space
Got insurance on the trap house, Allstate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a heart rate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a 808
Boom, like a 808

I could fly around that bitch, need a tarmac
I just landed in Cuba, need a straw hat
I gotta get the raw back, I need a format
I put the shit on horseback and start my own ranch
From where they don't talk smack, they just snort smack
I'll turn your head to an open hot sauce pack
I tell the bitch some true lies and some false facts
Boy, I'm drownin' in the syrup like a short stack
Ooh, 187, 211
Hockey mask on, Wayne Gretzky
Stunt my ass off, chain heavy
Your bitch get passed on, chain letter
Train smoker, smoke plain, never
Had a date with the Devil
Then I changed schedules
I'm a trained killer
Like a paid killer
Better yet, Saddam Hussein nephew
Nigga, no love
That's from the bottom of my heart
I pull up and paint your whole fucking block red
Then get out of my car and admire my art
Then smile at my thoughts
My bitch from Atlanta got eyes like a hawk
She see why I'm a boss
I just got another speeding ticket on the Bugatti
While it was parked
Now I don't wan' talk, bitch, I don't wan' talk
Lean in my punch, I decided to spar
Anybody want war?
I'm excited to start
Get indicted tomorrow
I be out by the morn
Before I even yawn
Stay in ya lane, I remind these lil' boys
This is victory lane, now do I need a horn?
The struggle is real, and the Bible too long
I'm writing my will, and I'm typing my won'ts
Lord, please
Kilos, OZ's
'Cause my bitch high class, she like Pinot and cheese
I dropped out of class so I'm zero degrees
I can out-think a shrink, she can deep throat a tree
I can hijack a Brinks, so my sweet soda pink
I'm a freak show to freaks
I'm spitting these bars, hope my bar tab is cheap
I'm a hard man to reach
I'm newborn and deceased
I'm too hard for this beat
I'm the heart and the beat
The Chong and the Cheech
My blunt long as a speech
Roach look like a leech
I'm too long for the brief
I'm too wrong for the priest
With this chrome on your teeth
That get blown out your cheek
Like my bitch mixed, like Long Island Tea
She don't hide her figure, she don't hide her feet
I'm the head nigga, like Prodigy
And bitch, I'ma shine, like Connery
Yeah

And you know I come with some pressure, gotta be certain
Too picky, I cannot just fall for any person
Too picky, gotta be for me and promise not to turn, yeah
She keep her spliff on Deebo and I keep my blunt on Big Worm, yeah
You know they gon' be focusing on everything that we do, yeah

No cap

[Chorus]
She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya

[Verse 1]
I know I ain't perfect
Got shit I need to work on, a nigga been workin'
I know you uncertain
You ride for me and I drive you crazy and I know I've been swervin'
I know you've been nervous, I know I've been reckless
And now you all heartless, and now it's all worthless
I don't deserve ya, you don't deserve this
I turned a blessing into a burden
I'm really sorry, I know it don't fix it
A nigga been wishin' that I could reverse it
I know it don't help it, I know I look selfish
And looks are deceiving, but you lookin' further
And you lookin' past me, I'm just a has-been
How did this happen? What is the current? Where's your endurance?
You actin' like you've never been in love, like you just a tourist
Shit was the purest 'til you got curious
You know that love don't come with insurance
I blame the jurists who put me on trial
They was sick of your smile, now we just cured 'em
That got me furious, people that knew of us
Tell me they sorry, I said that make two of us
Wonder what ruined 'em
Wonder how beautiful you look at your wedding when I'm at my funeral, goddamn

Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya
So I tried to call, but I couldn't reach ya, you blocked my number
I feel like James Harden, you blocked my jumper, goddamn

[Verse 2]
Who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'?
Since it ain't me, just tell lil' homie he lucky, I'm lonely for nothing
I'm starin' at the phone and the button to call 'em to come in
I'm starin' at the walls, I been punchin' these walls, did me nothin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin' when stars were abundant
Then shit happened, and all of the sudden the toilet start flushing
Try to avoid the confrontin', enjoy the consumption
With outside noise and seduction, it's harder to function
Look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
They told me that I know that I'm wrong, but I don't know what's right, goddamn
[Pre-Chorus]
(Love me), you must hate me (Or leave me)
Love me or leave me

Real wars up in my head, crash courses in my head
Fightin' forces in my head, white noises soundin' red

My eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea, yeah, yeah

I fuck her, get dressed, and go handle my business
This shit on my neck got my head on a swivel
I'm drownin' in my dream like my bed is a river
I wake up in beast mode, I ate her like Skittles
I'm colorblind, when I fade to black it look similar to
White gold and platinum and grey and to silver
I bust down a bustdown, that's self-motivation
I bust on her skin, now she exfoliatin'
I treat the nina like forever my lady
Got two extendos, that's a thirty for thirty
You ain't from around here, we need verification
These rocks is so big like I'm wearing a glacier
These streets is so cold, nigga, Hell a vacation
I'm street smart, lil' woadie, that's edumacation
And I had told young boy to watch out for oldhead
I told young boy that I'll knock off his old head
Told him I'll put his head right next to your head

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down
Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'

I think in my backyard, I need an airport
Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Fab Five
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards
Oh, woah, mahogany, yeah, woah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah nigga, pistol to your ear nigga
Have my big homie kill your lil' nigga
We heard the bricks comin' on the boat
We at the dock, we at the pier nigga
You won't even spot or hear niggas
But when they get here nigga, we gon' pop up and appear nigga
On some DMX shit, we gon' be like, ""We right here, nigga""
Even though we right here, we far away, we light years nigga
And my AK got diarrhea nigga
I'm promethazine, mixed with gasoline, mixed with antifreeze
And you just some light beer nigga
Sig Sauer spit a wig for ya, sip oil better than an oil rig, dig?
All your bust downs sparklin' like foil
And the coke got me sweatin', keep a towel on my shoulder
Like I used to coach the Georgetown Hoyas
I would walk down and draw down on you
Tell your woadies pray for you
And your shooters better be some fuckin' Golden State Warriors
I'm gettin' older, other day I told my soldiers
Spare nothin' except the strollers, but my heart used to be colder
Never sober so a nigga prolly higher when he sober
I be higher than the Solar System, get rich and control the system
I was servin' it like, Anna Kournikova
From a Nissan Pathfinder, now I have to find a chauffer
I got alphabet bitches, I do numbers, I do digits

You niggas do anything for fame and clout
What would you do for your freedom? Might give a statement out
I'm from a city nobody think they'd make it out
Got a key and a Glock, I took the paper route
Gave my people the block, straightened out
And I'll be back by mornin'
Whip the bricks until your back side's soarin'
I just bust the AP, that's a fact, mind's water for my bracelet
Dropped twenty like Jordan on a bad night, scorin'
'Gnac pourin', I just pulled up in a matte white foreign
Stick got a drum in the beam and the flashlight on it, yikes
Yeah, my shit's bad like Lauryn, I ran into her
On my last night tourin', I'm a mack, like, hol' up

Bust it down 'til the scale break, did a buck thirty on the beltway
Caught a bomb, Travis Kelce, 'fore we touch down, it's a tailgate
Piece lookin' like a milkshake, had to back up, give myself space
Fake statements and my health straight
I can't give a fuck what no one else say
So deep, it's like a jailbreak when the coupe slide down MLK
That's a bulletproof CLK, fire lands on the shelf case
Turned felons into executives, made a half a mil' and it felt great
Y'all niggas just a lil' late, got a big house on a lil' lake
And we both know how the smoke go
Shots peel straight through a steel plate
Never throw stones when you know
You livin' in a glass house like you Bill Gates
Good on both coasts like I'm LJ, Bape store out in LA
Bougie nigga even when I'm dead
Cause I'ma die and get to hell late, ugh

Y'all lil' niggas is some foot soldiers, I'm a foot fungus
You dead, brother
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button
The gun headbutt you like ""Bang, bang, bang, bang""
'Til your heart stop drummin'
I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer
But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off
This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball
Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9""
But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga
Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid

Turn a nigga noodle to nada

I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait

My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head
He ain't got no credit and his Apple Card is dead
What's in your wallet?

I was dead broke, sleep on the futon
Now I'm up, now I'm big house, few of 'em
Everyday I'm lit, my life like a re-run
If I take your shit, can't give you no refund
Ten mil' for a deal I agree on

Now I'm trying to keep them snakes up out my garden
Put your ear up to my safe, the money snoring
Carolina blue sorta look like Jordan's
Let's get high for Nipsey and pop a blue dolphin
And yes I gotta keep them snakes up out my garden
But keep that Mamba Mentality regardless
'Cause I know harder times are waiting for me in the future
All I can do is stay in my lane and put my gear in neutral

And when I hit the ground I sunk
Yeah they thought I was down, I'm up
I was lost now I'm found, what's up
I came too far around to give up
When I was down on my dick
Everybody was missing, they thought I would miss them
But I got in that kitchen and cooked up this wisdom
I started a system
If you really love your niggas you'd never risk them, yeah

You won't even spot or hear niggas
But when they get here nigga, we gon' pop up and appear nigga
On some DMX shit, we gon' be like, ""We right here, nigga""
Even though we right here, we far away, we light years nigga
And my AK got diarrhea nigga
I'm promethazine, mixed with gasoline, mixed with antifreeze
And you just some light beer nigga
Sig Sauer spit a wig for ya, sip oil better than an oil rig, dig?
All your bust downs sparklin' like foil
And the coke got me sweatin', keep a towel on my shoulder
Like I used to coach the Georgetown Hoyas
I would walk down and draw down on you
Tell your woadies pray for you
And your shooters better be some fuckin' Golden State Warriors
I'm gettin' older, other day I told my soldiers
Spare nothin' except the strollers, but my heart used to be colder
Never sober so a nigga prolly higher when he sober
I be higher than the Solar System, get rich and control the system

Got a key and a Glock, I took the paper route
Gave my people the block, straightened out
And I'll be back by mornin'
Whip the bricks until your back side's soarin'
I just bust the AP, that's a fact, mind's water for my bracelet
Dropped twenty like Jordan on a bad night, scorin'

That's a bulletproof CLK, fire lands on the shelf case
Turned felons into executives, made a half a mil' and it felt great
Y'all niggas just a lil' late, got a big house on a lil' lake
And we both know how the smoke go
Shots peel straight through a steel plate

Yeah, pressure busts pipes and I'm so piped up
Look at your wife and she gets mind fucked

Love is blind, so it can't find us

Welcome to the funeral, yeah
Closed casket as usual
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
The choir's singin' musicals
Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with that Uzi, though
And they look like they saw Lucifer
Rrr
Welcome to the funeral
We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke
(Phew)
That's just unexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them
We been to quite a few of 'em
The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

[Verse]
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Soul snatching, that's usual
Amen, hallelujah though
Whole family delusional
Niggas cryin' like two-year-olds
Bullet holes come through the doors
I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose
Damn, welcome to your funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin', though
Gotta die to see who you know
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin them
The preacher preach, we shootin' him
Now we need one for you and him
That's why they should cremate ya
Hope when you die they commemorate you
Life is a movie and it's in theaters
Some of y'alls already went to cable
Get shot from afar, you can get a facial
Black gun, chrome gun, interracial
Weed so strong, need ventilation
Funeral home need renovation
I got your mom's teary-eyed, that's precipitation
Nigga, when you died, did your bitch a favor
Nigga, we gon' mob like the Genoveses
Nigga, fat mob, I'ma Jenny Craig 'em
Drive-bys in a Winnebago
Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes
From a hundred feet away, now it's a halo
That's tomato sauce, Heinz 57
Catch up, nigga, you behind, where I left you
I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins
Uncles, aunts, and your nephew (Pfft)
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Look his pretty kid in the face, poor bastard
Tears runnin' down his bitch face, romantic
Two straps on me like the old Bo Jacksons (Bah)
In his face, closed casket
Send him on the highway to heaven, no traffic
My lil' nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic
He cried tears of joy, then he got 'em tatted
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Whole family delusional
Amen, hallelujah though
Choir singing musicals, Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with the Uzi though
They look like they saw Lucifer
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
Everybody knew you, bro

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down
Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'

I think in my backyard, I need an airport
Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Fab Five
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards
Oh, woah, mahogany, yeah, woah

What's good, brother?
Beat 'round the bush and I'ma come around with a bush cutter and look for you
You niggas talkin' too much shit
I'm about to find a good plumber
Y'all lil' niggas is some foot soldiers, I'm a foot fungus
You dead, brother
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button
The gun headbutt you like ""Bang, bang, bang, bang""
'Til your heart stop drummin'
I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer
But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off
This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball
Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9""
But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga
Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid
I'm out of my Kufi, narcotic abuser
No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'
Your partners is poodles
Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless

They find 'em, I lose 'em, I'm hidin' out
Hopin' I don't smell like all these fuckin' vaginas I'm douchin'
Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry
I'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive
Designers, excuse me, massagers masseuse me
Oops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey

Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta
Turn a nigga noodle to nada
Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie
This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it
I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head
He ain't got no credit and his Apple Card is dead
What's in your wallet?

(Chill Stump on the beat)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a plus sized model
But she my lil' mama
I make her bust it open for me like a piñata
And as the world turned, she was my spin doctor
'Cause when I was down, you all got lost on me like Bin Laden
I know that times changed, I don't think I've changed
I changed my mind a bunch of times, but that's just mind games
Baby, stop playin' with me
Do I look like I'm playin' with you?
I was runnin' from myself, and that's just who I ran into
Closed my eyes last night and had a dream I was dyin'
When I woke up, I was surprised, and I hate surprises
I hate to love, they love to hate, but when it's all synchronizin'
It feel just like the flames have died up in this cold state of mind
Promethazine tranquilizers as I say my goodbyes
Paid them no mind, and as I wait for my receipt
I just got my face tatted and it felt orgasming
I got on a straightjacket, then it must be fashion week
I just look like this, ho, don't be comparin' me
Shit is so embarrassing, low-key flattering
They'd rather battle royale, way before they battle me
Long live my skateboard and rest in peace to Adam Z
Motherfucker, stop playin' with me
See Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like[Chorus]
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, it's been a long time
For a long time
Time sure flies but it's on a long flight
No I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well bitch, it's game time
And you gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I've been feelin' like a killer since the diapers
I've been feelin' like a hitter since the minors
Sticky icky like a itsy bitsy spider
They say to be or not to be, bitch, I'm indecisive
I'm in the buildin' like the interior designer
You in your feelings like a bitch when she get her cycle
Ain't that a bitch, ain't that a bitch? I'm yellin', ""Please don't wife her""
Dwayne Carter, niggas wanna be the DC sniper
Well, fuck it, I'm thuggin' on the low, I'm ballin' on the high
I'm fuckin' on the floor, she can crawl but can't hide
I'm Bloodin' with my bros, goin' hard with my slimes
It ain't nothin' to a GOAT but the roar of a lion
Jungle book, ho, it's another book show
No car keys needed, button push, go
We gon' ghost ride in the whip, then she believe in ghosts
I'ma snowplow on that bitch until she freezin' cold
She gon' slope style on the dick until she eat the snow
Put my foot down in this bitch, these niggas twinkle toes
Nigga, sit down, you a bitch, I heard your seat unfold
Way up in the nosebleeds, hold your head back, squeeze your nose
[Outro]
Nigga, stop playin' with me
Stop playing with me
It's been a long time, a long time
Long, long time since she loved me long time
Told her stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me
No, I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well then it's game time
You gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch
Yes, I've been on time, for a long time
And time sure flies, but it's on a long flight
And you gon' stop playin' with me, yeah3Embed"

She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya

[Verse 1]
I know I ain't perfect
Got shit I need to work on, a nigga been workin'
I know you uncertain
You ride for me and I drive you crazy and I know I've been swervin'
I know you've been nervous, I know I've been reckless
And now you all heartless, and now it's all worthless
I don't deserve ya, you don't deserve this
I turned a blessing into a burden
I'm really sorry, I know it don't fix it
A nigga been wishin' that I could reverse it
I know it don't help it, I know I look selfish
And looks are deceiving, but you lookin' further
And you lookin' past me, I'm just a has-been
How did this happen? What is the current? Where's your endurance?
You actin' like you've never been in love, like you just a tourist
Shit was the purest 'til you got curious
You know that love don't come with insurance
I blame the jurists who put me on trial
They was sick of your smile, now we just cured 'em
That got me furious, people that knew of us
Tell me they sorry, I said that make two of us
Wonder what ruined 'em
Wonder how beautiful you look at your wedding when I'm at my funeral, goddamn

Since it ain't me, just tell lil' homie he lucky, I'm lonely for nothing
I'm starin' at the phone and the button to call 'em to come in
I'm starin' at the walls, I been punchin' these walls, did me nothin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin' when stars were abundant
Then shit happened, and all of the sudden the toilet start flushing
Try to avoid the confrontin', enjoy the consumption
With outside noise and seduction, it's harder to function
Look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
They told me that I know that I'm wrong, but I don't know what's right, goddamn

Huh, Mama used to say this when she stand above my baby crib
Never trust nobody that could bleed for five days and live
Grandma used to say that this world gon' come to a crazy end
Monsters in my closet was the feds taking baby pics
Daddy used to look at me like, ""Who the fuck this baby is?""
Uncle used to say, ""Your daddy just too young to raise a kid""
Daddy used to treat my mama like they never made a kid
I'm Satan's kid, I'm Satan's kid, I'm Satan's kid (I'm Satan's kid)

Uh, I know the tables turn like tornadoes turn
I know the way it turn, gotta wait your turn
Until you take your turn, fuck a wrong turn
I made the world turn, that's a turn on
I'm on every song that I turn on
I got it turnt up, got it turnt on
I'm on the turnpike, I'm 'bout to turn off
Weed loud as every siren they turn on
Bust down so bright, it's burning
These diamonds so white, they German
Your diamonds ain't right, they turning

It is my time, and when it is, you on timeout
I'm on Cloud 9 and, nigga, you just on iCloud
I'm an icon, I shine and burn your eyes out
You on the sideline, my side bitch got a side bitch
Gotta sip slow 'case I die quick, I'm alive, bitch
Born piss poor, I'ma die rich full of my shit
Bust up in your house on some mob shit, leave no hostage
Leave it lookin' like January 2nd, July 5th
Y'all are all witnesses to my battles, I shall fight
Been through a whole lotta bullshit, still smell nice
Poverty to penitentiary straight to paradise
Took a few Ls, without 'em, I couldn't spell ""life""

I could take her ex out of her vocabulary

[Chorus]
I, yeah got a lot on my mind
Tell my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say ""Why?"" I say ""Why?""
He say ""Damn, my nigga, never mind,"" oh no
That's why I just get high
I light one and watch time go by, go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
No, really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

[Verse 2]
We ain't no junkies, but today, we're like Snow White
Whatever we like, she don't judge me
Though I may need her to be the one to give me life
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows? Not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Never mind
[Outro]
I, I, got a lot on my mind
To my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say ""Why?"" I say ""Why?""
He say ""Damn, my nigga, never mind""3Embed"

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I did not come here to see who was litty
That stamp on the kilos say ""key to the city""
Put some on my thumb and then I make her lick it
She can't feel her tongue, well, bitch, I beg to differ
I smoke gasoline and I sip down some lean
My whole tangerine on this dick, trampoline
I chop you up, they call them amputees
I spit these facts, they call me fax machine

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I drop a four in this, I'm feelin' glorious
Gun on Big Pun, and my clip on Notorious
Bitch, I'm the man, no, the Mandalorian
I'm in a DeLorean, nigga, I'm floorin' it
I got my whore in it, that bitch a foreigner
Pourin' her heart out, I'm just ignorin' her
I let my hair down, I'm finna go throw her
And bury myself in that pussy, no coroner
I can't smoke Reggie, I be too edgy
My bitch a veggie, bitch, I'm a legend
Pull out my flag, and these niggas start pledgin'
Go pull up whenever, we ain't gotta schedule it
Boy, I'm a president, presidential Rollie
Bezel it heavily, inspect it carefully
I'm smokin' like I'm in the Netherlands
Like I'm a hippie that's stuck in the 70s
You with your buddies, I'm with my bloodies
And this ain't no flag, lil' nigga, this rugby
Duct-tape that nigga up until he a mummy
Then put him in a freezer until we get hungry

Welcome to the funeral, yeah
Closed casket as usual
Yeah, welcome to the funeral

Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with that Uzi, though
And they look like they saw Lucifer
Rrr
Welcome to the funeral
We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke
(Phew)
That's just unexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them
We been to quite a few of 'em
The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

[Verse]
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Soul snatching, that's usual
Amen, hallelujah though
Whole family delusional
Niggas cryin' like two-year-olds
Bullet holes come through the doors
I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose
Damn, welcome to your funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin', though
Gotta die to see who you know
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin them
The preacher preach, we shootin' him
Now we need one for you and him
That's why they should cremate ya
Hope when you die they commemorate you
Life is a movie and it's in theaters
Some of y'alls already went to cable
Get shot from afar, you can get a facial
Black gun, chrome gun, interracial
Weed so strong, need ventilation
Funeral home need renovation
I got your mom's teary-eyed, that's precipitation
Nigga, when you died, did your bitch a favor
Nigga, we gon' mob like the Genoveses
Nigga, fat mob, I'ma Jenny Craig 'em
Drive-bys in a Winnebago
Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes
From a hundred feet away, now it's a halo
That's tomato sauce, Heinz 57
Catch up, nigga, you behind, where I left you
I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins
Uncles, aunts, and your nephew (Pfft)
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Look his pretty kid in the face, poor bastard
Tears runnin' down his bitch face, romantic
Two straps on me like the old Bo Jacksons (Bah)
In his face, closed casket
Send him on the highway to heaven, no traffic
My lil' nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic
He cried tears of joy, then he got 'em tatted
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Whole family delusional
Amen, hallelujah though

Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing

Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out

Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda

This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball
Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9""
But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga
Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid
I'm out of my Kufi, narcotic abuser
No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'
Your partners is poodles
Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless
Titty-fuck your baby mama
She breastfeed your child while I do it, I'm stupid

[Verse 2]
I'm out of my Tunechi, I'm mindin' my Tunechi
I'm shinin' my Uzi
They find 'em, I lose 'em, I'm hidin' out
Hopin' I don't smell like all these fuckin' vaginas I'm douchin'
Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry
I'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive
Designers, excuse me, massagers masseuse me
Oops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey
Turn you and lil' mami, to tuna salami
You pukin', she vomit, that's beautiful science
That's Tune in a Masi', that's who in a Hyundai
You stupid or drowsy? I pew in the 'Gatti
Pew, pew and I got 'em, pew, pew and I got 'em
Lil' Tunechi a shotta
Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta
Turn a nigga noodle to nada
Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie
This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it
I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head
He ain't got no credit and his Apple Card is dead
What's in your wallet?

(Chill Stump on the beat)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a plus sized model
But she my lil' mama
I make her bust it open for me like a piñata
And as the world turned, she was my spin doctor
'Cause when I was down, you all got lost on me like Bin Laden
I know that times changed, I don't think I've changed
I changed my mind a bunch of times, but that's just mind games
Baby, stop playin' with me
Do I look like I'm playin' with you?
I was runnin' from myself, and that's just who I ran into
Closed my eyes last night and had a dream I was dyin'
When I woke up, I was surprised, and I hate surprises
I hate to love, they love to hate, but when it's all synchronizin'
It feel just like the flames have died up in this cold state of mind
Promethazine tranquilizers as I say my goodbyes
Paid them no mind, and as I wait for my receipt
I just got my face tatted and it felt orgasming
I got on a straightjacket, then it must be fashion week
I just look like this, ho, don't be comparin' me
Shit is so embarrassing, low-key flattering
They'd rather battle royale, way before they battle me
Long live my skateboard and rest in peace to Adam Z

You think it's play time? Well bitch, it's game time
And you gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I've been feelin' like a killer since the diapers
I've been feelin' like a hitter since the minors
Sticky icky like a itsy bitsy spider
They say to be or not to be, bitch, I'm indecisive
I'm in the buildin' like the interior designer
You in your feelings like a bitch when she get her cycle
Ain't that a bitch, ain't that a bitch? I'm yellin', ""Please don't wife her""
Dwayne Carter, niggas wanna be the DC sniper
Well, fuck it, I'm thuggin' on the low, I'm ballin' on the high
I'm fuckin' on the floor, she can crawl but can't hide
I'm Bloodin' with my bros, goin' hard with my slimes
It ain't nothin' to a GOAT but the roar of a lion
Jungle book, ho, it's another book show
No car keys needed, button push, go
We gon' ghost ride in the whip, then she believe in ghosts
I'ma snowplow on that bitch until she freezin' cold
She gon' slope style on the dick until she eat the snow
Put my foot down in this bitch, these niggas twinkle toes

Way up in the nosebleeds, hold your head back, squeeze your nose

You ride for me and I drive you crazy and I know I've been swervin'
I know you've been nervous, I know I've been reckless
And now you all heartless, and now it's all worthless

I turned a blessing into a burden
I'm really sorry, I know it don't fix it
A nigga been wishin' that I could reverse it
I know it don't help it, I know I look selfish
And looks are deceiving, but you lookin' further
And you lookin' past me, I'm just a has-been
How did this happen? What is the current? Where's your endurance?
You actin' like you've never been in love, like you just a tourist
Shit was the purest 'til you got curious
You know that love don't come with insurance
I blame the jurists who put me on trial
They was sick of your smile, now we just cured 'em

I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin' when stars were abundant
Then shit happened, and all of the sudden the toilet start flushing
Try to avoid the confrontin', enjoy the consumption

[Intro]
Ayy, tell you what you should do, son

[Verse]
Uh, let's get personal, Percocet got me vertical
Them Uzis get so surgical, shooters, they shoot like Türkoğlu
We murder you, then bury you, dig a hole and throw dirt at you
You disappear like abracadabra, magic like 32
It is my time, and when it is, you on timeout
I'm on Cloud 9 and, nigga, you just on iCloud
I'm an icon, I shine and burn your eyes out
You on the sideline, my side bitch got a side bitch
Gotta sip slow 'case I die quick, I'm alive, bitch
Born piss poor, I'ma die rich full of my shit
Bust up in your house on some mob shit, leave no hostage
Leave it lookin' like January 2nd, July 5th
Y'all are all witnesses to my battles, I shall fight
Been through a whole lotta bullshit, still smell nice
Poverty to penitentiary straight to paradise
Took a few Ls, without 'em, I couldn't spell ""life""
Airtight, vagina tight and it better smell right
Banana clip, big banana up in her tailpipe
Big fish, nigga, killer whale, kill a bitch nigga
I'ma snap and send a pic, nigga, flick-flick, nigga
Tunechi, I pop me a Perc and I smoke me some loud
Oh my God, I'm gettin' personal now
All I could see is the purplest clouds
Oh my God, we gettin' virtual now
I'm 'bout to sip on this syrup 'til I drown
Oh my God, I'm gettin' thirstier now
I'm ballin' way too hard on these clowns

Fu-fuck it-fuck it up, fuck 'em up
Hit him up, hunt 'em down, hurry up
Shoot him up, shut him down, shut him up
Eat her out, dick her down, cuddle up
But bitches comin' 'round with the funny love
Lick me up, lick me down, done enough
Eat her up, spit her out, bubblegum
Treat her right, treat her out, trouble come
Got some cocaine and a couple blunts
It's ashes to ashes, dust to dust
.44 plastic, the rubber bust
We don't wear masks, 'cause it must be us
I got the Holy Ghost in my Backwood
On my tippytoes and them flat-foot
Bitch pigeon-toed and her cat good
I know her pussy hole like my MacBook
She Tootsie-Roll on the black wood
Get her own page in the black book
And it's startin' to feel like I'm attached to her
If it's that good, I put a stamp to her
I'm a warlord to these fuckin' boys
Double-edged sword and a bubble, boy
I just won a war in a Hummer 'fore I'm 'bout to come to yours
Lookin' for a war, I am nothin' more than somethin' more
Than much more as the punch pour
And I slunch more with my lungs sore
I smoke you and your blunt blowers
Let's get on with it, Megatron with it
Telephone like a telethon
Bitches workin' bitches like a Peloton
Finish yellow bones dizzy, very long visits
And I'm talkin' numbers, Jerry Jones digits
I'm at home sippin', and I'm gone sippin'
Got a Draco with my arm in it
Shoot you in your heart, put some charm in it
Sorry, gotta leave your mama tormented
""Bah, bah, bah"" if she commented
Cops pulled up, and they vomited
I am not finished, hope they long-winded
Money long-livin' with a strong finish

I guess I love tryna love, hey

We so faded, we can't make it up my stairs
We fuck right there
Not so lucky, but tonight, I just crapped out
Vegas sucks, I'm still gambling with her, no protection
Protect what?
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams

Dwayne, mama proud of you
You done came so far
I can't wait for your album to come out
A lot of people ask me when it's coming out
They can't wait for your album to come out
I'm just proud of you
You's my rock, you've always been my rock
Mama love you, I love you
You take care of me and then some
And your brother, we don’t wanted for nothing
I thank the Lord every day for keeping us on this earth
And in good health
I just pray things go well with you in life
But I thank the Lord, because I know you have been through a lot that I don't even know about
Mama love you
I love you Dwayne, with all my heart
You is my life
I live for you
You make sure mama's tooken care of
I don't care if you don't have it, you gon' make sure I get it anyway
Even though you don't have it to give
And my son though, Semaj, ain't wanted for nothing
Anything Semaj call you for, you gon' make sure he get it
Your children ain't wanted for nothin', you is a man, a truly man
Mama love you, I can't wait 'til your album come out
Because everybody asking about it and I know it's gon' be a beautiful album

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Oh), don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads, ""Don’t cry, stay tuned""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll (Let 'em drop and roll)
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)

""You tatted your face—""
Bugatti, new boo
""You screamed, 'Suu whoop'—""
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
""You bought a Bugatti—"", so you can flex
""And most of the bad bitches your ex""
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo, new subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs, much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move, two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you? Two middle fingers that's up high to whom it may consume
Kaboom, goddamn, who knew that I am the guru with voodoo that sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man, and see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam, sit back and watch, and do not watch your watch hand, give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man, I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock, but it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man, I do what I can to keep it solid as a-- you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights they get low
And all of the curtains they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They could do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma take me to a space shuttle
Say, now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who? I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gon' break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you

You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A

As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted
[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne) / Both]
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him"" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothing, keep resting,""
She say, ""What's missing?""—""How you know something missing?""
He scratched his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,""
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, ""Ooh""

I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,""
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me a salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier!""
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
For a minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,""
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ""Ooh,"" dead emotion (Ooh)

Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter
[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that.17Embed"

Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me

And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass

Zaytoven

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don’t wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I’m never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

[Verse 1]
Off button, pause button, stop button, lock button
Belly button, big ol' titties, she pop buttons, head buttin'
Versace button down unbuttoned to the top button
Percocets, that's my buttons, hit the pop button
Psychopath, blunt big, big as Mama June off the diet plan
Smokin' science lab
I should have a tattoo that say, ""I am nothin' like my dad""
Jesus Christ, amen
My hand in the psychic's hand, she see righteous plans
I see business plans then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, ""Oooh, Lordy,"" smellin' like Cool Water
Just got them new Cartier, the Rollie was too salty
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My little bitch body a trophy
Naked pics, five in the morning, sunglasses, smilin’ emoji
Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley
That is your homie, he died for ya
Check your home screen, that's God callin’ (Hello?)
We makin' an impact, my nigga
We not just black, nigga, we rich and black, nigga
And all them bitches they been after niggas
They run away then they come limpin' back, nigga
Amen, feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My lil' bitch body'll solve it
And when you say, ""Timber,"" please, will you whisper?

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace, I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak, after I pray, I preach
I don't play, I cheat, after I stay, I leave
The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat
Turn that piggy bank to some hog head cheese
But you doin' nothing, well they say, ""Nothin' ain't never worth nothin', but it's always free""
Psychopath
Blunt thick, thick as Mama June off the diet plan, smokin' science lab
I should have tattoo that say, ""I'm nothin' like your man""
Jesus Christ, Amen!
My hand in the psychic' hand
She see righteous plans, I see power plans
She take my hands put 'em in her pants
Do the hyphy dance then I wipe my hands

Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I’m dope, nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em—it's that ""Carter V,"" let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin’ every winter
And as long as I’m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I’m not a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin’, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up

I was no different from those niggas, but I was chose, nigga
See those niggas saw more in me than these hoes, nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach, nigga
Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system
For that bitch who played her role with ya and those children
I ain't lyin', slime, all my niggas balling, it's a fuckin' team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga—get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up
Sittin’ on this money to me feel like a cactus

Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happiest goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like ""let's play,"" lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone

I fucked around and made a buncha fuck around money
Now I feel like found money
I'm fuckin' awesome, 'til awesome have a child for me
Got homies who ain't comin' home 'til the cows comin'
Niggas with power, they tryna press our power buttons
Now baby, make that ass clap like it's proud of me

Its Lil Tunechi, word around on the streets
That everythin' is workin' out like obliques, they wanna see it obese
You drive me crazy you gon' crash the 'vert
Get out my business why you act like a clerk
I got a white girl she call me names like bastard and jerk
That's when I send her ass back to the 'burbs
Fucked her right good night, die wit' em open
I'm wit' a big booty bitch dressed inappropriate
Cocaine, bakin' soda, and some hot water
Kept the fiends comin' back to me, not karma
Smiled at my first kilo like a proud father
Smiled at my first judge like I'll be out tomorrow
Keep the Glock on 'em
All eyes on me, I had a Pac moment
This a Mannie Fresh beat and I go Pac on it
My homeboys proud of me like Barack homies
Your homeboys tired of me, I hope they die yawnin'

Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 1]
She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning

But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel

And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced

Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died

I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror

And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?

And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 1]
Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, ""Why you leave your shit here?""
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back

She said, ""Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way""
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, ""Let go my arm!""

You goin' at my slime then you're going at me, slime

Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes

I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose
Run up in a nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
Safe code now nigga, cough it up or spit it out
Oh my God I'm flipping out, flipping out then dipping out

With my bros will smoke you niggas, like we grow you niggas
Kill your ho too nigga, and your go-to niggas
I've been riding 'round the city with the safety off
Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the beast side

Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah
I'm in this bitch
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
""Don't let the money come between us""
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out""
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, ""Let that shit work itself out""
""Let that shit work itself out""

Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can hear them pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out
[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, ""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet
[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]
Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
Let it all work out (Phew)
""Let it all work out""
(But he said, ""Remember this:"")
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""And don't forget what I did this, bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch"")
""Let it all—""
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)

Don't try to race, this car got horses, the pint we drink, it costs a mortgage (Yeah)
Flow so dope, man, you can't copy, you can't bite it, you can't forge it
I got bars, with more in storage, watch me blossom, watch me flourish
If you try to touch my porridge, you will feel my chucks like Norris
All my bitches think I'm gorgeous, get a massage while I'm recordin'
Single like a dollar bill, I am a free man, call me Morgan
Come and slob on my knob (Knob), like corn on the cob (Yeah)
Check in with me (Yeah), and go and do your job (Hey)
Now lay in the bed (Yeah), and then give me head (Hey)

Baby, get to geekin', get to geekin' and gobblin'
Your friends think I'm bad, they must be lookin' for trouble then
It's a foam party, I be bustin' they bubbles then
Then I hop in the whip, make a play on some bricks
My homies say, ""Pull up"", we just came up on a lick
I'm in the ends with the sticks, it's the revenge of the Crips
Ho, you know it's O.H.B., I brought the gang in this bitch

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ho, you know it's L.A.T., we almost famous, lil' bitch
On our toes and on our feet like Usher Raymond, lil' bitch

Fat head, long neck, she 'bout to strangle this dick
I got more bang-bang in a stick than butane in a bic
I got my whole gang-gang in this bitch and you came with a bitch
I got more purple rain than Prince and more cocaine than Mitch
I got more shit than piss, it make more money than sense
She got more hips than tits, she got more tricks than tips
She put my name on her tongue and then she licks her lips
L.W., Lil Wayne, to them, to her, that's length and width
Kill you for me, she will like Jada Pinkett Smith
It's the return of the Blood, 'bout to turn up and thug
We won't know who got the chicken, show the colonel the gun
Me and my dirty-ass stripper take a bath in 1s
Make her milk these fuckin' niggas like some Cap'n Crunch
Motherfuckers try to test me, I ain't cram for one
All these fuckin' karats on me, bitch, I'm Rabbit's son
Happy birthday, I already got the gift of gab at one
Motherfuckers run they mouth until they cramp they tongue
Play pussy, get fucked, play ass, get stuck
Playtime is over, that ass is grass and now that grass get cut
Duct tape and we quackin' up, then beat 'em with more bats
Than a vampires and Draculas, ashes to ashes to dust
Buried just for starin', yellow tape like canaries
We all bite and no talk, my sharks breakin' your aquarium
Out of the ordinaries and went to the art of hustlin'

Check, I'ma do 'em like Big Meech, this strip club's in '03
Like when MJ dropped sixty-nine on the Cavs in OT
Keith Moore with a low fade, fiends still in the Stone Age
Goons in the crowd strapped hope, they don't clap while I'm on stage
Side talk, I'm immune to, been the new kid in the new school
I ain't too fond of the new school, I'm an old soul in a young man
Bump Johnny Cash when I cruise through, two cokes still a hot boy
But I'm too cool, I'll hold a grudge 'til I beat whoever I lose to
We the ones who had good girls by the pool snortin' up lines
I'm the reason all the bad college bitches never showed up on time
We the one who had Cristiano in Japan throwin' up signs (Signs)
Born to lose but I built up, always knew growin' up I
I think I'm made for this shit

When the Warriors come out to play, y'all all fail
I got fish scale, I got four scales
I'm the nigga in the city pushin' dope deals
HoodyBaby in the kitchen when the smoke clears
I can clear two-hunnid thousand like my throat, yeah
I make it rumble in the jungle where koalas lie
Bitches call me HoodyBear, i'm koala-fied
Oh that went over your head? I'm over qualified
Really make them guns fly, bitch I'm stuck in overdrive
Trick or treat, live or die? Let my bro decide
All this trappin' in my Jesus piece like show you right

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
L.A.T, Moms was hard on me with grades
Had to turn them Bs to A, now I'm turning words to paper
Turnin' birds to haters, fry their wings and legs
I prefer a leg, I deserve a raise
Should be overpaid, I just toast the bread
I ain't burn the bread, made it gold instead
Turning more than heads, take a lemon head
Turn it into bread, got the golden dreads
Got me on the meds, had a talk with Tez
About me on the meds, forgot the shit he said
I'm out here on the edge, don't try to sell me, Reg
I'll knock you off the ledge, I'll pop off on sketch
Prayin' like pledge, bullets gon' spread
Catch 'em like Dez, all in your ass
Handguns in the console, I'm a shark in the fishbowl
Runnin' plays on my rich hoes, sunny days in the North Pole
I'm a player, play my part, ho, turn a rock to the charcoal
Heart throb but my heart close, short ride on a long road
Long days and them long nights, big dogs, yeah, we all bite
Big words, just all hype, small talk, large price
Alright, not nice, heart cold, hot ice
She sucks, she wipes, she swallows, drops mic
Stop light, stop runnin' your mouth 'fore I run in your mouth
From a hundred dollas to a hundred accounts
Got fuckin' problems, tryna figure 'em out
Niggas run in your house waitin' on my count
Bitches in they house waiting on my call
Mula Gang, Mula Gang, Mula Gang, yes, Lord
I think I'm made for this shit

And I'm duckin' trial
I used to throw my money away, now I recycle
Shout out to the Vice Lords, and to Disciples
That's that gang talk, you need subtitles
We sendin' Scud missiles
Your bitch in love with us
We simply mud sippers
More cane than a cripple
Look I am nobody, 'cause nobody's perfect
Abracadabra, I make a ho out a virgin
I treat her like a servant
Thanks for your service
I'm cold like sherbet
Got it sewed up like a surgeon
It's me and Mannie Fresh back together, bitch we mergin'

Dope man
Dope man, coke man

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I play the Porsche, 918
I mean the Spyder, you do not know what I mean
I got a driver for my drop top limousine
Go ask your bitch, I bet she know 'bout Mr. G
Yeah, he like to talk
She like to talk
So when he drop her off
They have a heart to heart
Guess he got all the answers
And I got all the verses
My Benzo got no ceilings
But the windows came with curtains
So me and G swervin'
Me and G swerve
I keep the double-R, me and Steve Kerr
Popping these Percs like I'm on injury reserve
And when the pockets full of lint, we want that lint to be fur
Amen, Amen
No baking soda, my nigga, we play it raw
We put some holes in them niggas, we playin' golf
Want you to know it's me, nigga, my mask off
Cut out your tongue, put that bitch in a glass jar
Then drop it off to your kid's classroom
Dirt bags, we belong on a vacuum
A pad room, I fuck in my bathroom
Long hallways, my room is the last room
Long hard days, my schedule don't have room
You home all day, you stuck on your MacBook
I'm gone all day, I'm chasing that checkbook
I'm stoned all day, I'm stoned all day, I'm on D'ussé
And back in the day we was on Section 8
Now we in our own section, motherfucker, like ""Ayy""
All you niggas know what time it is like Flav
Public Enemy Number One like Flav
Fifteen with a mouth full of golds like Flav
Fifteen with a house full of hoes like Hef
Gave G the day off 'cause the car park itself
Shots take off like a stealth
And they landing in your scalp
Letting human heads replace the Grammies on the shelf
Put a bitch head right below the belt 'til she belch
And she won't get a dollar; zero, zilch
Cup muddy-muddy, muddy-muddy-muddy
Tunechi pass the blunt, I'm gon' need time to study
They don't know who got the gun
But they know who got the money
We don't wanna know what's up
We wanna know who got the money
What these niggas wanna do?
What these bitches want from me?
Bitches claiming I'm a dog
But these bitches want puppies
These bitches bring luggage
My bitches bring others
My bitches bring rubbers
Your bitches burn rubbers
Your bitches burn supper
I'm still major and I made you niggas
You getting bodied by a skater, nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that be Skypin' bitches
Shout out to all my bitches one nightin' niggas
Woah, make sure you hit 'em with the Slut Walk
Yeah, then text that man to fuck off
And I pour up another one, another one
The cream soda tasting like bubble gum
Woah, straight swerving on these niggas
From Collins, to Highland, to Bourbon on these niggas
Them other niggas just wasn't deserving of me, niggas
So I'm swerving on them niggas
No more Family Matters, no more Urkel on them niggas
I'm feeling like a born again virgin on them niggas
I'm running to the bank quick as Herchel on them niggas
What's in your wallet?
I done went commercial on them niggas
On purpose on them niggas
All black hoodie, all black gat to match
Yeah, put it to your hat, and Blat!

My name is Weezy Baby, and I'm high—

Hi! My name is—you know what my name is
Bitch, I'm famous, like Tom Brady
And hi—your name is? Not important
Who cares? Not Weezy Baby, ugh

[Verse 1]
Wake up, I see ""bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch""
Ugh, makeup on my pillows make me mad, bitch
Without no makeup, I see that bitch as just average
Ugh, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi
Looking at my Rollie, I got boogers on my Rollie
'Bout to hook up with my whoadie
Got the hook-up on that codeine
Got the sugar for your nose ring
Got the blooka, I'm reloading
And according to my darling, this dick feels so damn rewarding
I'm reporting out of shorty, she so naughty, me so horny
Kilo on me like I'm Tony, break it down to Rice-A-Roni
Take her out, look like she lonely
I'm gon' candlelight the moment
I'ma vandalize the pussy
She told him ""My phone was roaming,"" ugh
She be moaning 'til the morning, I be goin' in
I be on it, I be in it, I'm like Foreman on the grill
And I got doormen at the entrance
They got pistols in they trenches

Her guy? He's nameless, he ain't shit
Always on the same shit—poor baby

[Verse 2]
I pour up so much, they call me ""Pour Baby""
Kush man, I need a sack like Charles Haley
Sipping to the Big Moe, I'm the Barre Baby
Sip got me moving slow, but my thoughts racing, err!
My long days give me short patience
My heart vacant, awards taken
What in tarnation? No information, no statements
Young Mula, old moolah, moolah all ages
Ha-Hallelujah, I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac
Roc-A-Fella, new rock, hundred K in a shoebox
AK and a new Glock go, ""Wop-bap-ba-loo-bop""
Pray the vest you got save you like a coupon
Hustle 'til my dreadlock is grey as some Poupon
Every day is my birthday: I'm a newborn
Stay on my toes, ask a shoehorn
I ain't got no roof on, gettin' my No Ceilings 2 on

And hi, I'm brainless, I'm stainless
Entertainment: His lady
And, um, if she ain't thick, then she ain't it
I can't fuck with a slim lady

Bitch ancient, bitch shady, and she tired
Okay, then—I'm skatin'
Doing tricks—call me ""'Trick Swayze""

Okay, In other news and other niggas' hoes
Your wife taste like Honey Nut Cheerios
I'm in the mirror, like ""Ooh, baby""
Who needs a miracle when I got you, baby?
Pimpin' in my last life; I'm the shit, you ass-wipe
Beat the pussy, cat fight, my teeth look like a flashlight
Weed is like a airline, 'cause easily, I'm that high
Fistful of money: Mix some green in with your black eye
Greedy like a fat guy, I'll eat a nigga franchise
I beat him by a landslide, a leader like a rabbi
I'm leading by halftime; he bleeding, I'm a vampire
His body in the trunk with his feet all on my Alpines
We the niggas—that's right, we all that and fries
Y'all on standby, my broads got cat eyes
Traphouse landlines, boom like landmines
All my bitches allies with ""Tune"" on they backside

So hi, my name is on her anus
On her cranium, bitch cravin'

Hey now, you're an all-star
But the bitches you be with, they are sub-par
But the bitches you be with, they be cock-blockin'
Hope you put the kids to sleep, baby cock-blockin'
You could really get this meat, get this hot sausage
And I'm way too rich to beef, I just buy a body
And I really kick my feet up, and that's not karate
Yeah, I really kick my feet up, let a thot massage 'em, yeah

Where ya ass was at when I was with the Hot Boys?
Probably watchin' Baller Blockin', eatin' popcorn, yeah
Where ya ass was at? You was in the drought, boy
I was probably at the fight bringin' out Floyd

[Verse 2]
Said she love me 'cause I'm laid back, she outgoin'
Opposites attract, pockets fat, like Samoan
I just told my goons I got it, I just waved 'em off
I just told Tunechi, ""I got it"" and he said, ""Of course""
Lose my mind, the only time I'd ever take a loss
I work too hard for taking off, rrt, I'm taking off
Really 'bout to see a billion, I'm in arm's reach
Sleep on a hammock in the middle of two palm trees
My neighbors can't sleep, all they hearin' is them cars screech
My bitch can't sleep, all she hearin' is them car keys

I should've known you'd cross me
I'm from the hood, that's where they taught me
Go hard until they off me

I don't cry about it
And I barely get sleep anyway
I should've known you would cross me9Embed"

[Verse]
Wait a minute
Wait a minute, where you going?
Ain't my business where you going
I just want some before you go and
Wait why you in your feelings when I wanna feel something?
Why you in your purse when I'm tryin' to tell you something?
Why you on your phone after 2 in the morning?
Who the fuck you talking to at 2 in the morning, girl?
I swear I'm with my side bitch baby
'Cause I ain't got time for your main tricks
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
And if the side bitch start acting crazy
I'mma run to the next side bitch
And tell the last bitch ""Come chase me, baby""
Yeah, feel like it's over, you know it's over with
You get my feelings and time and shit
I'm in my feelings 'cause it's over
And you know right is right, so come over tonight
Don't want fuss and fight, let's get right
Right now a nigga feeling so nice
And I feel like I owe you something
Let me show you something, girl
And it's gon' be nice
Right now a nigga feeling so nice
Feel like I owe you something
Let me show you something, girl
Yeah, I'm nice, T I'm nice
Yeah, E I'm nice, Hood I'm nice, Steve I'm nice
Hold up, I think these pills give me extra emotions
Hold up, I think they kicking in, I'm going through the motions
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I feel like celebrating, what you doing? I'm about to come over
Your homegirl there, I really feel like I can take both of 'em
Oh my
Can I ask why
You give me that eye
Every time we Facetime?
That's 'cause you know I
I'mma come back, reply
With ""Don't you move a muscle, I'm 'bout to come by""
Every time, like we on rewind
Back it up, rewind
Like (Missy Elliot Reference)
We fuck on Versace
You watch me
'Cause I got the mirror on top me
And I be just going in like Rocky
That dick got you snoring, I record you, send you a copy
You be so embarrassed, you say don't mock me
And I be like ""That's our secret that I keep""
And I feel like pouring some lean in this styr-e
Said I feel like pouring some lean in this styr-e
Hold up
You know I'm the nicest, this dick need a license
But why did you leave me? I swear it's a crisis
If you ever need me, I come quick as lightning
Don't give him no pussy if he cum quick as lightning
Just saw your sis and I got so excited
She tell me you just celebrated sobriety
But you didn't invite me
That's that bullshit, I need a lighter
You should be nicer
Yeah, I swear I'm with my side bitch baby (hold up)
'Cause I ain't got time for your main tricks
Yeah-yeah-yeah (hold up)
But that's OK 'cause I'm nice
Hey Manny, I'm nice

What’s happening? Come on man
What’s up with these niggas man?
Yeaahh
Nigga Millz with that New York shit man
One time for my nigga T in this bitch
Yeah, tired of these niggas me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I can make her do tricks
Make the bitch do splits
Write your name on a bullet like a gift
I’m Saint Nick
Overdosing off the dough
Comatosing on the low
Keep my hands on some coke
Like Guns n’ Roses, rock n’ roll
The guns we tote is not for show
Welcome to the murder show
Welcome to the murder capital
That’s capital NO
That’s New Orleans
It’s you or me
If that’s so, you gotta go
You drop the gun
I drop the world
I drop some cash
You drop the soap
Rep that soowoo dada-do
I just got Bluetooth on my stove
You don’t wan try me like Dej Loaf
Yeah I know, I know, I know
My Spanish ho she love me so
She say “amor amor amor”
These lil boys don’t want no war
Them toy soldiers, G.I. Joe
Mystical
Here I go, here I go
Vehicle, Diablo
All black, white seats, piano
Yeah you're from Santiago
You don’t want no fiasco
We don’t do Donnie Brasco
And tell your crew I said let’s go
Tell your crew I said leggo

Oh it’s way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right
Yeah ahh
He think that he gone take it from me
He said I should give it up cause he got money
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
All of my niggas is real, all of my niggas is solid
All of my money is in rubber bands, I do not carry a wallet
All of my bitches stay ready, soon as I walk in she gon pop it
Everyday I be floating, forever on autopilot
If that nigga ain’t got my money though
Wrap him up like a mummy though
Regular wolves howl at the moon
My wolves come out when it’s sunny though
My niggas ain’t got no words with police
You tell the cops what they wanna know
This shit right here is my dummy flow
No Ibaka but I bring that thunder though
Your girl a jumpoff, I holler ""Geronimo""
Slam in that pussy like dominos
That boy Millz he got beats and all kinds of flows
What you think Weezy signed me for?
Stayed down and I’m still down
True definition of loyal
My style timeless, my style vintage, Crown Royal
From birth to now, heart Big like L, Notorious, and Pun
I want what I deserve, and some
Yeah I’m ballin’ - And 1
All my niggas outside with me
All my niggas down the ride with me
And every freak that that I ever meet
Gotta fuck my girl if she slide with me
That’s word

Oh it’s way past midnight

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
We kick down the door, said it before
We did not come round to play games with you niggas
They say you nobody til somebody kills ya
Well I’m bout to make you a famous lil nigga
No game in this killer, murder he wrote
Can get life behind bars with these murderous quotes
The flow is like meth, it’s like crack, it’s like heroin
Yes I am spitting this dope
I am the future, I’m seeing right through you
I’m so New Orleans but I do not know voodoo
My piece will come face-to-face with you like Oovoo
Have niggas searching for you like it’s Google, I’m brutal
I’ve been slept on for a long time
Been patient for a minute, now I want mine
I hear a lot of niggas talking down
I’ma put my mothafuckin foot where the sun don’t shine
Can’t rhyme in a cypher like this
I’ve been rockin with the best
They don’t put me on the list
I’m an underground king
Underrated in the streets favorite
Every street corner gonna speak bout this
Rest in peace Pimp C
Still got the muddy cup full of Morgan Freeman
Yep, lean on me
Like Wu Tang, cash rules everything around me
You know I got the cream on me
Gun barrel smoking like hydro
Middle fingers up, fuck five-o
Still repping B's like a H-town nigga
When I’m finished in this bitch call Geico
You looking at a god man, I put that on the Bible
Killin’ everything fuck rivals
Hundred round drum on the stick
When I let the bitch off man it sound like pyro
[Chorus: Shanell]
Oh it’s way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right

She tryna put this money in her stocking
She kinda thick as fuck and got some knockers, woah
My niggas really Blood, and you just spotting whoa
We all over the bread like a Sloppy Joe
And when I'm in the pussy I'm a boss, knock her off
My enemy don't cross the line I draw, respect my art
Man I swear to God, these pussies soft like a moth
Weezy baby, diaper off, different cloth, different thoughts
Sippin' syrup like it's broth, life is short
Tart, fuck his bitch, whip his kids, drive his car
I'm grindin', tryna stack a hundred commas

And we ain't got no traitors in our posse
And really I'm just wavy and I'm saucy
And really I'm amazing and I'm awesome

If you ain't got no skaters you ain't gnarly nigga
If you ain't been to Vegas, you ain't party nigga

And me, I'm a lil 504 New Orleans nigga

And Hoody, he from Texas, bitches boppin', mane
And since I met him, I ain't ran out of drank, whoa!

When we leave H-Town, it's in a fish tank
Glass house Chevrolet, you can see everything
Bad bitches with cocaine nose rings
Give it up to real niggas and expose lames
Cold game, got me in the Mulsanne
Killin' these streets, audio drug slang
If you don't collect Ferraris, you ain't poppin', nigga
You could learn Italian in my driveway, bitches
If it ain't OG, I ain't coppin'
Don't smoke, we just throw it in the garbage
Them niggas ain't tough, they just talkin'
Outchea after dark, them niggas targets
Horror movie writer, I be with the monsters
Trill surround us, you might not make it out 'em
Phone calls in the morning, say they found him
Whole hood wanna see what y'all gon' do about it
Rolled up on the front porch at my grandma's house
Watchin' Blood Sport through the screen door
What you know about gunshots? Ever seen war?
I've really seen more than I talk 'bout, nigga
Stuntin' on streets you're scared to drive down
Our town, children be firin' live rounds
Hug the ground 'cause the shit gettin' serious
Fuck around, get killed unintentional
While I'm outchea eatin', nigga, Whole Foods
Rollin' up straight gas, fresh produce
I'm the guy that you go to, criminal smooth
Digital moves, triple the loot
Hopped on the phone, called the lot, ""Gimme the coupe""
I thought of Tune, called back, told him, ""Give me two""
That's what I do
If you ain't got no Daytons, you ain't poppin', nigga
One time for my low-riders hoppin', nigga

The water might fall, but life is a beach
When my number’s called, I get out my seat
When my niggas ball, I give em my speech
You might hit a wall, or end up like me
You might have to crawl, but get up like me
And you bite before bark, never I before we
And you pray before eating and you lay with your heat
And you stay with your heat and you lay on your mink
Bitches lay at your feet and you play with your kids

I think I’m seeing things
When I don’t see a thing
I woke up and realized
All the nightmares that dreaming brings
Let my people go
I know y’all hear 'em screaming things
Now load up choppers
Point it at the coppers
Let-let freedom ring
I like the sweeter things
So what bitch, no needle strings
I wake up, stretch my feet and wings
My life has no deleted scenes
I pop-pop-pop and leave the scene
Leave the scene Noxzema clean
Sippin on that lean cuisine
Incredible Hulk on creatine
My nigga
Fuck the world
And may I mention, fuck the world again
But I wanna go around the world
Tune, you down to go around the world again?
I am
And you can trust in a nigga like fam
I’m hitting these licks with my niggas like stamps
Giving these hoes headaches like rams
Yes ma’am
And I
I just might call your girl a friend
But fuck her like she my girlfriend
Talk to her like she my girl
Like, oops you look like my girl’s twin
I sin, I'm bad, I meant ""My bad""
I’m lost in future, present, past
All those drinks I had
I speed, I'm fast, I blink, I crash
They say it’s my time
I’m racing time, I think I’m last
And if Tune mentions lean again
Then I might drink his stash
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks
New school, but all I listen to is older raps
Bitch I still
I still been drinking on the low
I never think because I know
And pimpin haven't died and money getting old
And now the wrinkles starting to show
My rims twinkle like a toe
I’m tippy toeing wit' your ho
One thing led to another, and then the pencil broke
I got that; handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Police in disguises, I don’t like surprises
I don’t like tomatoes, I don’t like tamales
Shoutout to my plugs, I pray the rats don’t chew the wires
Straight ballin, you niggas just bald spots
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out
And you pussy niggas get hauled off
No cough drops
I’m tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop
I’m off topic
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill
I’m no role model
I’m rollin' with models, rollin' off pills
I’m rollin' over
Whoever's not rollin' with us, then road kill
Tryna get Uncle Phil cake
In case I die tryin' I wrote Wills
I’m chillin', for the moment
'Til I can’t figure out the code
To get the motherfucking safe open
Who the fuck left the cage open
Stage of rage
I’m liable to blow your fucking face open
Every bone you could break, broken
If I go broke, every home I could break in, broke in
Pussy look like a steak smokin'
Niggas slippin' like the lake frozen
And I hate rodents
And I stay chokin'
Off the straight potent
'Til it make no sense
Niggas talking shit
Nigga I can get you wacked
Nigga you can picture that
'Til you break your lens
Nigga take your ends
Nigga fuck your ho
While you cutting your grass
Nigga cut your throat
Taking out your trash
Pull up on you slow
Going nowhere fast
When you got nowhere to go
Nigga hung 'em by a rope
Dump 'em by the boats
Fuck 'em, adios
Fuck 'em, I don't care
Got a bad bitch naked
And she just asked
“What you gonna do to me that I ain't done to myself?”
I say “Ooh talk dirty, but don’t talk long""
You leave Wayne’s world it’s a long walk home
My pockets on that growth hormone
I call them shots, can I get a dialtone
Yeah
Mula, can I get a million
'Til the heads or tails
'Til I get a full coin
Full fledge, full house
When your friend gon' join?
Got a friend in the cut with a gun by the groin
And what are friends for
I’m still the boss, don’t get sent for
Roger that, 10-4
Nigga send me, point 'em out
Where he at, I got 'em
We don't wanna see you back in court
The weed so loud bitches get ignored
Cause I ain't got time to go back and forth
I told that bitch don't question me
Bitch, if you do you asking for it

No ceilings

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ayy, my milly rock, my milly pop (Bop!)
Them niggas ain't hot, they petty wap
Sippin' Barney, smokin' Baby Bop
She's performing on the table top
Steph Curry, boy, I'll take the shot (Bop-bop)
Then I'll pull off and wave goodbye
I'm ready for the war, I'm not afraid to die
My niggas wild like Omega Psi
My bitches screamin' ""Ooh-la-la""
I tell my demons ""Kumbaya""
Them sticks go ""Boo-ya-ka""
Make a nigga say ""Uhh na-na-na-na-na""
I got money on my mental
Got them niggas in my rear view
I'm a dog, I'm a dog
Rottweilin' on these Shih tzu's
Drop dollars on your temple
Pop collars like a pistol
Drive back and forth for codeine
Put some mileage on the rental
Money talks like Jimmy Kimmel
Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno
I'm straight N.O., the U-N-O
Fast life, so uptempo
Ooh-wee, Presidential
In the Backwood, eating Mentos
Smoke that loud like crescendos
Rep the Mob like De Niro
Fucking like a nympho
Save her info like a hero
Write your name on a bullet
She wrote my name on her dildo
Smoking on that kill though
Got me happier than Gilmo'

Holler at them bitches, Lucci Lou

[Verse 2: Lucci Lou]
Give a fuck about you haters
More concerned with stacking paper
Smoking bog and sipping Lakers
Watch your girl 'cause I can take her
Drop the top, no ceilings
As I'm plottin' on millions
With my niggas in this bitch
They like ""Fuck it Lucci, get 'em""
I'm from that East side of New Orleans
Polo T's and Jordans
Where niggas dream to push foreigns
And all the hoes want ballers
I got the cheapest price on pearly white
If you need it, nigga, just call us
Long as you talking them dollars
I got it, nigga, just holler
Still no job – bitch, I ain't hurtin'
Put a ho on the stroll and told her ""Get to workin'""
She dropped a Xanny in his drink, the Rolly in her purse
Then brought it back to Daddy, man I swear this pimpin' work
I pop the clutch and hit the gas, I love the way it skrrt
She popped a bean and poppin' ass, can't keep it in her skirt
I beat it up, she eat it up, no feelings
It's Lucci Lou and Tunechi, nigga, no ceilings
[Verse 3: Turk]
No ceilings, bih, like an astronaut
Turk and Wayne back at it, nigga, we ain't gon' stop
Thuggin' nigga, it's thug life, 2Pac
My youngin with me, they stay strapped with two Glocks
I'm Molly turnt, but so uptown, throwing threes up like slime
Pussy nigga keep hating on me, keep hating, I ain't got time
Too busy chasing this paper, got money on my mind
Fuck you and your favors, know you seen my grind
I kicked the habit, never thought I could
That shit had me since fourteen
I was shooting up, nigga, on tour, fucking up my dreams
Fucking off my green, fucking off with these hoes
Could've died over a million times, I swear only God knows
Now I'm back nigga, like a hungry dog at the doorstep, let's eat
Tell you pussy niggas that slept on me
""Hope you bitches die in your sleep""
Free my brother BG
I'ma scream the shit til he hit the streets
Til my brother Ralo RIP, I got that nigga

You at home broke as fuck doing the milly rock
I'm in Hollywood with millions, check my Diddy bop
Sipping Actavis, I put that on my double cup
Pushing work, man, we got the whole city hot
Raised up on Jeezy, Jay'd up on Yeezys
Young Money millionaires, me, T and Weezy
Sixteen in the peezy
Another sixteen, that's a PT
36 that's a keyzee
Push button start, bitches thought I lost my keys, please
Trappin' out my haunted house of ghosts, there's some scares there
And I got that work, homie yeah, yeah
Finessing all these niggas, I need air fare
All these diamonds dancing on me, baby very
I might call them Michael Jordans, I need every pair
Tell your homie hit my line, I got fishscale

[Verse 2: T@]
Certified hustler, yeah, real street nigga
It took me 31 years to make my first million
But I ain't trippin', this the beginnin'
Lost deposits at Chase, no time for chasing women
All black Porsche slammed on them red mags
I peel her top back and watch the haters get mad
They need to stop it, niggas don't like when you
Balling on them bitches, they just mad ‘cause they ain't got shit
And niggas with the gossip, ol' Dr. Phil ass nigga
You might as well go 'head on and start a talk show
Me and Hoody making big moves off in this Tahoe
Your bitch travel hundred feet, work off in that rental
Backstabber smile in my face, showing the dentals
But you know me, I chunk the deuces at them bitches
Never stop the chat, I keep it moving on them bitches
In and out of town and yeah I do it for my city
East side New Orleans is where a nigga get it
So have your money right or else I ain't fucking with ya
And I ain't posing twice so I hope you got the picture

Distorting guys with the cutter
I'll rob a motherfucker talking all that big money shit
Got me hustling like I never had shit
I'm restarting from the bottom, now ain't that a bitch
But watch me turn this pit into a Brad Pitt
Yeah, watch me turn this world into a hand print
The money made me hungry like I'm fastin'
I see the stars lining up, I feel like NASA
I seen my homies give up on me like a marriage
I went back and counted up and no more stunting like my daddy, ah
Then my bitches hit me up and said she love me like a daddy, ah
Cuban bitch walking 'round my house like she live there
Wake up in her mouth, she dribble like Sebastian Telfair

We sipping that oil, we sipping that oil, more oil than Oil of Olay
You killas don't play, kill 'em on sight in the middle of the day
Shoot a nigga right in the middle of his face
Bullet be biting like a venomous snake
Pussy be tighter than traffic, LA
We got that white, we traffic all day

Now it's champagne and caviar steak
But still reporting live from the gutter, bitch
Before I fade away I hit 'em with the stutter step

Before I fade away I hit 'em with the stutter step
I hustle like it's nothin', left my woman in her underwear
My youngin don't wear underwear, I love my -
Yeah I love my baby mothers, yeah, little hoody ain't no huggy bear
I represent that grizzly bear, my neck look like a city fair
Page out the Jungle Book, amazed is how your woman looks
When she see me and all my niggas coming
Afraid is how your gunners look, we take a finger, tongue or foot
And mail it to your people, we mean business, get that understood

You heard what I say, yeah I sip when I get up
And work everyday, I'm a hell of a nigga

None of you squares wanna battle lil nigga
Cause shots come from nowhere like, Bop!

You hit your bitch up, she never came
She was with me up in Neverland
I hit your clique up and everything
I take two clips up in everything
I'm coming, I'm shooting up everything
I just bought my woman some Vera Wang
I just bought myself Alexander Wang
I just bought myself some new Louis frames
I got 'em prescribed cause I'm blind as fuck
Or is it that I just don't wanna see you again?
Got 'em prescribed

Born to be alive

And TMZ said I died (damn)
I run with bitch-slappers
Your hate don't impact us
Our bitches' dick-grabbers
Your bitches' pic-snappers
You just a camera rapper
But we don't point cameras at you
We point them hammers at you
More bullets than hammer dancers
We take the pineapple
And we fill it with purple, we never settle
We take the Mac-11
We point that bitch straight at your cerebellum

Look at the smile on me
Spent a couple hundred thou' on it
And the game been drove me crazy
Over hundred thousand miles on me
Damn, said she gonna lie for me
I said you just lied to me
She tell me that's my pussy

Bitches tryna put the gangster on me
Feds tryna put sanctions on me
The doctor tryna do maintenance on me
Guess that's why I take  meds on 'em
Pop and sip and go to bed on 'em
New Ferrari, no head on it
Nice new carpet, you bled on it
These new artists no competition
Top of the charts no top of the menu
That ain't art, nigga drop the pencil
She drop the drawers, I never drop the pistol
But I drop the clip
And pull out a new clip
I'm not 'bout that lip
Bop-bop, nobody exempt
And you see the flaaag, as red as a bitch
You see the swaaag, I'm wavy and lit
My pops had them bricks, yeah, brick wall
My slime got them sticks, bop
And I can do tricks, yeah, skateboard
And my lil boo mixed, yeah
Just met her dad
Gave her momma a kiss
When she turned her back
I holla'd at sis
Yeah
Watch out lil bro
I fly G4
My slimes say I'm brazy, I used to talk to a globe
I tell it it's mine, I tell it ""One day you be mine""
I tell the front page ""You be mine""
I was locked up upstate for that iron
You know I'm comin' straight off the top
She knew I cum on her halter top
Cause she know I don't want no five children
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
Bitch, is you dykin' or not?
These niggas is wifin' the thots
I still got some white in my sock
As white as my sock
The white in her snot, uh
I know it could be anybody
So I prepare for everybody
We wavin' that thing at your body
We cravin' to catch us a body! Bop
Look at the watch on my friend
Say hello to my lil friend
My chopper due any day now
Bop-bop; that bitch just had twins
Lord, you run your mouth like a marathon
I just run out of them styrofoams
The Cialis give me testosterone
Now she got her legs on my collarbone
All on my neck like a herringbone
I had to sit down with Bizzy Bone
I had to sit down with Tity Boi
And told him just how I'mma kill his song
It's not a remix
It's just me, on my comeback and shit
I just unwrapped a brick
Put it on the scale, it come back thirty-six
It come back thirty-six
Then that's when we whip, we mastered the wrist
Then that's when it flip
Then after it flip, that's when it flip
You know what it's like when the feeling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
Watch out lil bitch
My partner got hitched
No influence
On me, it had no influence
I don't know my daaad, but my momma is rich
You see the red flaaag, but my partner a Crip
Damn! Watch out lil ho
Ooh, Pew, I fly G4
Ooh, you got jet laaag stuck at the airport
Damn, I'm in LA stuntin' on Melrose
Yeah, stuntin' on them hoes in them Yeezy's

If I don't get my check, I'm gonna be chin-checkin' for nothin'
If I don't get my check, I'm gonna be chin-checkin' in public
Long story short, I'm just gettin' to the money
Long story short, I'mma keep it short and sweet
I get to the money, I don't let it get to me
All my niggas ballin', it's the way this shit should be
I pull up on my darlin' and I lay the dick and leave
She'll thank you for comin'
I'll put that dick in her stomach
You put that cash on the dresser for her
You take the bitch out to restaurants
You took the bitch out the reservoir
And took the bitch straight to the fuckin' mall
I get higher than cholesterol
I see money in my crystal ball

Hello, what up nigga

Tryna break me off, you better break me off some money
Talkin' bout you love me? Better show me with the money
Show up at my door? Better show up with the money
Take me somewhere nice? It better be private and sunny
I got what you want, you got what I need

Smoking on strong, money long, we don't reason
Probably with my niggas, but my bitch Polynesian
Met this bad little broad, she was curvy
Sipped out in the middle of the day, I started early
Balling in the middle of the drought, we ain't worried
Middle finger up to the judge and I'm smirking
Bring your squad cause you know my gang with me
Drop the top on the car, let the tints breathe
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds snatching
Michael Myers, Norman Bates, Charles Manson
Commas, commas, commas, commas, commas cashing
We fight time and time and time and time and time and time
Again

No barkin' dogs or stray

Blow a hundred G's without panicking

I'm really playin' with money, you just tampering
You playin' with your life, why you gambling?
I'm fuckin' on your wife while you scrambling
I say who this pussy for, she say your majesty
I pull out a bag of white and she hit that and sneeze
She gone cut that nigga off, he an amputee
Now she really bout that life

And every time we see them lights
She hold that gun for me
And every time a package come she sample some for me
She ain't no actress but I got her actin' up for me
And all my niggas in cake mode

Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on
I'm 'bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lamb', I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, ""cock-a-doodle""

I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her

I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, ""Surprise,"" but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark

Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'

I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated

My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it

We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, ""Be quiet, we need our privacy""
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, hook you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi

Tunechi
Baby
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Uh, Lord I think I'm ballin' too hard
And my girlfriend think she too much
All she do is get pretty, I get shitfaced
Don't we make a cute couple?
To a broke heart we look like 2 bucks
I got a posse full of hitters
And a pocket full of ""In God We Trust""
It's been so long since I said ""It cost too much""
I'm so addicted to the fast money lifestyle
And withdrawal sucks
And dead presidents act immortal
But I know you see money's not a problem
Bal' like a butch bitch
Let's go on a shopping spree, take that shit to Goodwill
Money in a shoebox, what's up with all these shoeboxes?
Baby, I'm my own boss, ""Dwayne, you gon' get you fired!""

[Hook]
But I feel good, woo
I knew that I would, yeah
I feel good, yeah

All my kids already rich, and they kids, and they kids...
They think money grow on trees
And as tall as they grew, I climbed
Knock-knock ""Who's there?"" Hah!
I told the bitch ""It's just money""
The road can get a lil bumpy
So, on the low, I got that blow
And ya nose gon' feel like a trumpet
I'm goin home to my lil mama, she call me Big Poppa
She get hard dick and McDonald's
Cause she so tired of them Whoppers
I fuck her good, so proper, she say my name in Opera
I turn into a Piranha, then eat it like Tilapia
She know I'm going through a lot
So she say my name in Gospel
No weapon formed against Weezy shall prosper

‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on

Uh, I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except Heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my mama, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die the angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized
Lord, mama hate I got my daddy’s eyes
Never looked into my daddy’s eyes
He ain't have the time
Fuck him

Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one

I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it, then exchanged it
Fuck it, I'm working, bitch, I know you see me working
Searching for better days before a better person
I'm perfect
Just ask my bitch and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my head ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think
And I grew wings
If you catch a feather, just keep it
And I’ll be racing on; no shortcuts, no cheating

Life is just a race against time so have a good time

Oh Lord, what are we running from?

Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t fuck with us

Weed and syrup, yeah
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse 1]
All I know is paper, I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap and pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon, it's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy, keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind, and bodies on my nine
And I swear every day, I'm on my Ariana grind-de
I got that yay, I got that la-di-da-di-da
And a kamikaze squad, and you chicken parmesan
Lord, I'm a free man like I come from Amistad
No, I come from Hollygrove, turnin' Os to octagons
I get money while I'm 'sleep, I dream that I'm in Heaven
I dream I saw Lil Beezy and smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, rest in peace, and my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep, they catch him when he least expect 'em
Mama told me ""If you run these streets, run these streets correctly""
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows I wear new clothes to the mall
Two hoes on my arm
Fur boots when it's warm
Church shoes to play ball
I'm spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper, I don't love these hoes
Boy, that vest won't save you, neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him, better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord, all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy 'cause they been sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zeros
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord, all I know is paper, big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is, that bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience 'til I heard ""All aboard""
They mad 'cause I be skatin' at home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5K
I be spendin' 25K every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
'Cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house, bae
Plus we need the kitchen

Hol' up, had to switch the flow up
Had to pour up, roll some more up
Watch me go up, my doors go up
When I show up, why you show up?
Pick my bro up, pick a O up
Hit the store up, get a soda
Get us four cups, split a four up
Then we slow up, yeah, you know us
Then we toast cups and we post up
Don't approach us, we got toasters
That's my slime, like we ghostbust
And we both bust, give no fucks
Take no stuff and take your stuff
Then ho hunt for some chocha
I know a ho who'll rock the boat
But I row her, I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita, I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimeters
Oh Lord, I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms, he died recent
So I hope Heaven made more room for him, and I hope he see me

Shoot a nigga, wake up on the wake-up
Lay down in a model bitch A-cup
Then I put pearls in a bitch like Jacob
Play tough, tape off of this tape-up
Race off like some motherfuckin' makeup
Take off, looking for something to take up
Get the paper or you goin' in the paper?
Not horoscopes, but in the horror scope
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope
They gave my nigga thirty for a jar of dope
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap
Blowing so much, you sneezing dick
Believe in me, I don't believe in shit
Y'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip
It's Young Money 'til I'm in the freezer stiff, bitch
[Chorus: Junior Reid]
First degree murder
Beg them nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

[Verse 3: N.O. Capo]
It's all about the money, nigga, fuck the fame
Where we come from, shots ring, nigga, broad day
Lil' woadie said he had a chance, he'd do this shit again
Poppin' pills for the pain, but still won't feel a thing
It's deeper than this rap, I'm in the back soaking game
Cartier frames got 'em looking at me strange
Why pre mostly heard and I'm rarely sane
Low-key can still get a brick off my name
Now I'ma tell you this here for my youngin 'nem
The same ones I hung the corners with, do numbers with
If it ever was a problem, watch 'em pull up quick
Caught an L sticking to the script, you know I switched
We now switch

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner
[Outro: Junior Reid]
Starting, why?

Uhh, Uhh, I was chilling on the set
With the fully-automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Uhh, bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Can't trust these dog-ass hoes today
I say bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Can't trust these dog-ass hoes today
But I got one I really fuck with
She makes my heart skip a beat
She dropped her drum stick
Sometimes we fuck forever, sometimes I cum quick
I eat that pussy 'cause it's sweet, as sweet as one-six
Sixteen bullets in a clip, but more than one clip
Shoot a nigga sixteen times until I'm convinced
I got strawberry cocaine as sweet as Fun Dip
You know I keep some nose candy for my young bitch
I love my young bitch
'Cause she don't give me drama
You don't want no drama
My goons waitin' for you, to snap
Like some photo bombers
Yeah we leave a nigga flat
We leave 'em horizontal
And then my lawyer tell your honor
On that morning, I was –

That nigga Mack was chillin', Po was home talkin' on the phone
Lord, it's been such a good-year we need some Armor All
That nigga Hoody on the set, he got his hoodie on
Euro the future, fuck your future, like I'm reading palms
Wayne Chong, chinky eyes like I'm from Vietnam
Got my bitch with chinky eyes like that bitch Nia Long
Lord, I know I do my thing, can’t let my thing do me
Lord, I know I ain’t a Saint, still rep that fleur-de-lis
Lord, just keep Lil Reginae away from birds and bees
Let her be strong as the woman that gave birth to me
Fuck your degree, this murder in the first degree
I got that Tec under my arm like Right Guard, Sure, Degree

But Lord, the Devil busy
And when I do, I dream of you
And then the Devil pinch me
Do you ever miss me?
Do you ever wish we
Get it right and the rest is history?
I wish I could go back in time
And fix my lack of time
'Cause back then I had to grind
But see, you thought I’d rather grind
You thought I had the time
Thought I was lying half the time

Uh, hundred thousand on a small ass chain
Hundred thousand on a bottle champagne
Half a million for a watch with no diamonds
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the backyard
Elevator in the house, never got stuck
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck
I just looked at your bitch and got eye-fucked
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up
All you see is license plates far in front of ya
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life
She licked her lips twice and told me that I'm yummier
Glass house on the block, five floors in it
Got a picture on the wall that cost more than it
You observing it, I'm absorbing it
Judge mad 'cause a nigga make more than him
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims
I'm going in 'til I'm pouring in more than M's
I'm courtin' swimsuit models that don't know who I am
And foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films
My warrant's clear as day like Doris is
When I ain't trippin' then my lawyers is
So what the charges is?

Uh, one time
For the hustlers and the young moms
My presidential said it's crunch time
Looking in my son's eyes
Only time I see a upside
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy
Never be a punchline
Tell him never wait in one line
Tell him not even a lunch line
Pray more than sometimes
When the cops come, you tongue-tied
Take dirt, make a mud pie
Lookin' out the window
In the coupe with a bimbo
Talking 'bout who she resemble
Bitch, you in a Enzo
Stop being so simple
Now fuck me like we in a limo
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill
I got ocean views, I got water bills
I got cards to deal, I got hearts to steal
I got larger wheels on my automobile
I lost appeal
The bullshit cost me a mill
It brought me to tears
I came home and bought me a crib
I walk through that bitch
Strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge
I started to swig
But end up drinking all of that shit
'Cause I deserve it, I be working hard for all of this shit

Livin'

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Nigga, that's me in that nice-ass house
Butt-naked bitch with a nice ass
Walkin' 'round saying, ""You got a nice-ass house""
My phone keep ringin' though, my bad
I think my girl got me on spy cam now
My homies call cocaine ""white trash""
Charge you double just to take my trash out
I cannot fuck wit' you, bitch, 'cause you gon' get a nigga busted
Worryin' 'bout the wrong things while I'm hustlin'
Put the dick up in your mouth while it's runnin'
Bitch, don't ask no questions
Soon as I heard this, a young nigga killed it
'Cause I go too hard, I eat beats, mmm, scrumptious, delicious
Shoot you in your kidneys
I hope you see blood when you pissin'
We run up in your house on Christmas
And don't ask no questions
Just shoot whoever's present
While they open their presents
Oh please, Lord, forgive me
I just talked to my Reverend
Asked him if I'm the Devil
He said, ""That's these bitches""
See, I'm from New Orleans, that bitch is infested
Shootouts like the Westerns
Kill you and your bestie
Pay niggas to do it correctly
Two Ninas, they lesbians
I gotta shoot you with both or else one'd get jealous
I make money, not exceptions
Take pills like breath mints
She just get dick and refreshments
Free all my dogs in corrections
We all we got, don't need extras
We don't expect shit
We don't get mad over pussy
I'm probably lyin' in some pussy
While fools out here dyin' over pussy

Buyin' all the champagne, blowin' up the net
And settin' all the trends, showin' niggas what's next
I was drinkin' coffee, smokin' weed on the jet
Probably wit' your wifey in the back for pillow talk
But we ain’t talkin', gettin' top while ain't no top
Swear to God, I had a chopper
Now the gun biz are the friends hoppin' out a helicopter
I be rollin' up the doctor's wishes
Countin' up the money, kickin' out the bitches
'Cause they all up on you, but be gone when it get real
Bitches ain't shit but a brick through your windshield
Shows in the evening, business meetings in the morning

Wrist so cold, think it's sick and got Ebola

Arguments I'll never be a part of
Love pussy and some good conversation
And that money, we'll never see a shortage

I got a joint I just rolled that got a Liu Kang kick
I gotta do it big, that's just how I do things
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Uh, 'cause a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right (Young nigga)
A young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right, yeah (You see me)
Don't get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga livin' right, yeah (Livin')
Bitches see me and start gettin' right
Because they know a nigga livin' right, uh (You see me)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
My homie got the pistol and he might spazz out
Lifespan, motherfuckin' lifespan
That shit all depend on how tonight pan out
Ooh, I swear these hoes ain't right man
I left my shady bitch, I got a nice tan now
Red bandana in my right pocket
So if I pull the trigger, I can wipe that down
I just put my gun up in her Coach bag
I won't hesitate to pull it right back out
Life coach? I don't need no life coach
To coach me through my motherfuckin' ups and downs
Tell a bitch don't ask no questions
My money so old, I tell my new money ""Respect your elders""
I'm startin' to get jealous of my own reflection
The young nigga sexy, a young nigga healthy
A young nigga flexin', I'm countin' my blessings
""Achoo,"" ""God bless me,"" ""Thank you,"" ""You're welcome""
I talked to my Reverend, asked him if there’s a Heaven
A Heaven for a G, because me and my Gangstas
Done done it all, but never tell
He say ""We already in Hell,"" I say ""Ain't that a bitch?""
'Cause I work too hard, but still thankful as if this shit came as a gift
I just pray for my niggas that's out here still slangin' that shit
Keep my distance, I can't take that risk
I hope they understand
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
'Cause a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right (Livin')
Yeah, a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right, mmm (You see me)
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga livin' right, yeah (Livin')

Straight from the East side
Blood gang, we heavy
Fuck nigga, dare me
I turn into Freddy
My fingers machetes
Trap house jumpin' like Monta Ellis
We trap out the 'telly when we outta town
Uzi on deck
Phone ringin' off the hook, bitch, that's the plug
Ocean view bedroom, baby
See through showers and I just put some fish in my tub
Hold up, I ain't playin'
Niggas say they rich, I say ""And?""
Same old song, I ain't dance
Heater on my waist, hotter than a frying pan
If you don't see what I'm sayin'
I give your ass a fuckin' eye exam
I ain't playin'
Guns in my hands, I ain't prayin'
Fireman spittin' venom, Spiderman, I'm enhanced
I’m at peace, joggin' pants cost at least about a grand
I'm advanced like Japan
Got more sand than Sudan, Lord

[Bridge]
And life ain't nothin' but a long day
And tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way away
You know that haters come in all sizes, all shapes, 'kay
That's why I had to get a little more trunk space
Got insurance on the trap house, Allstate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a heart rate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a 808

I gotta get the raw back, I need a format
I put the shit on horseback and start my own ranch
From where they don't talk smack, they just snort smack
I'll turn your head to an open hot sauce pack
I tell the bitch some true lies and some false facts
Boy, I'm drownin' in the syrup like a short stack
Ooh, 187, 211
Hockey mask on, Wayne Gretzky
Stunt my ass off, chain heavy
Your bitch get passed on, chain letter
Train smoker, smoke plain, never
Had a date with the Devil
Then I changed schedules
I'm a trained killer
Like a paid killer
Better yet, Saddam Hussein nephew
Nigga, no love
That's from the bottom of my heart
I pull up and paint your whole fucking block red
Then get out of my car and admire my art
Then smile at my thoughts
My bitch from Atlanta got eyes like a hawk
She see why I'm a boss
I just got another speeding ticket on the Bugatti
While it was parked
Now I don't wan' talk, bitch, I don't wan' talk
Lean in my punch, I decided to spar
Anybody want war?
I'm excited to start
Get indicted tomorrow
I be out by the morn
Before I even yawn
Stay in ya lane, I remind these lil' boys
This is victory lane, now do I need a horn?
The struggle is real, and the Bible too long
I'm writing my will, and I'm typing my won'ts
Lord, please
Kilos, OZ's
'Cause my bitch high class, she like Pinot and cheese
I dropped out of class so I'm zero degrees
I can out-think a shrink, she can deep throat a tree
I can hijack a Brinks, so my sweet soda pink
I'm a freak show to freaks
I'm spitting these bars, hope my bar tab is cheap
I'm a hard man to reach
I'm newborn and deceased
I'm too hard for this beat
I'm the heart and the beat
The Chong and the Cheech
My blunt long as a speech
Roach look like a leech
I'm too long for the brief
I'm too wrong for the priest
With this chrome on your teeth
That get blown out your cheek
Like my bitch mixed, like Long Island Tea
She don't hide her figure, she don't hide her feet

They gon' have to give they styles back""
I said ""You too cray""
She said ""You too humble""
I said ""You too, bae""
She said ""You too sweet""
Then I ask her do she go both ways
She say ""They do say love is a two-way street""
I say ""Oooh""
Talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine
She gon' wanna shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum
I'm gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt
Never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
Sell birds to the bees
I sell birds to the trees
""Tune, I heard you don't sleep""
I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk, but I tweak
For that purple, that pink
Yeah you see what I'm saying
Like you heard what you see
I'm a verbal disease
I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets
Since my curtains was sheets
Chef on these beats
I'm just stirring the grease
That bitch you in love with
She working for me
I personally
Get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers
I'm at peace
Word
I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart, street smart
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek
I'm absurd, I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money
Time served and released
But this agent ain't free
Word
That's the word on these streets
But that shit is old news
That shit's so yesterweek
I'm just focused
Focused on my expertise
They like ""Tunechi, you good?""
I'm like ""Bob, yessiree!""
Now don't, I mean don't
Don't question me
Let me breathe
Dog, big dog
I cock back and shoot at ya fleas
Money long – Tree trunk
Now stand under me
Catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees
But repeat what you heard
You a dead parakeet
It's Tunechi, bitch
Your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on my balcony
We watch the moon eclipse
We do unusual shit
She gonna need lube for this
'Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world
She like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events
Lord
I'll kill a nigga right now
I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than
These niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth
I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fuckin' self
""You only live twice, slime""
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate, like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline
But they never tried mine
Spittin' like I'm sippin' cyanide
While my bitch sip a Mai Tai
But she wine fine
And I'm so sorry
She say ""Don't be sorry""
Woo
Then she say ""Don't apologize for shit
'Cause you the shit
And we know Tha Carter V the shit""
Woah

Ooh! Yeah
Lil Tunechi got it jumpin' like Jordan
These pussy ass niggas can't guard me
These rookie ass niggas still crawlin'
These lookin' ass niggas eyeballin'
These hookin' ass bitches eyeballin'
But I got a bad bitch at home cooking dinner
Hi honey, I'm home, I'm starvin'
These crooked ass cops still winnin'
Black man family still mournin'
Black President ain't do nothin'
We need a real nigga up in that office
Got the White House jumpin' like Jordan
Got the crack house jumpin' like Jordan
I want my new house bigger than Jordan's
With a backyard bigger than a forest
Like ""ooh"" bedroom jumpin' like Jordan
Hoes at the door and they arguin'
This dick a superstar, they want stardom
My life like Bailey and Barnum's
These bitches ain't got no manners
These niggas ain't got no standards
My bitch ain't got no love handles
Boy, I'm clippin' that toe on that camel
I got bitches that'll kill for me – Charles Manson
Suck this thuggish ruggish bone, swallow that bone marrow
Ooh, chopper sittin' on my lap like the mall Santa
Nigga, shoot you all in your gall bladder
Your pallbearers need pallbearers
I'm mixing weed like gumbo
I knock your head off – Fumble
Homeboys be cutthroat
That shit got me with a lump throat
But Tunechi bigger than Elvis Presley
Young Money was my best investment
Going harder than my predecessor
I don't break records, I sets the records
Lil Tunechi coming back like Kobe
Niggas stab me in the back, I owe 'em
Got a house in the hills
Now a nigga gotta deal
With mountain lions and coyotes
Semi, I keep that semi
And friendly, I can't be friendly
Freckles, them bullet holes look like freckles
You look like Wendy's
House in the hills jumpin' like Jordan
I can't swim but I'm throwing pool parties
I got a bitch over there, and a bitch over there
A young nigga starting to feel cornered
My LA house jumpin' like Jordan
My Miami house jumpin' like Jordan
Can't forget about my house in New Orleans
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry
I want my new bitch titties enormous
With a backyard and a pretty garden
With a pussy more pink than a orchid
Young nigga gonna treat it like a florist
I got my side bitch feeling important
I got my main bitch feeling immortal
I got my ex bitch feeling insulted
Cause wifey get money like Kimora
I got a fine bitch feeling exhausted
Cause I'mma put this dick on her 'til tomorrow
I'mma pull up on a bitch in a Gallardo
Then I'mma take the top off like a barber
I go down and kiss her Pearl Harbor
She's so down with this New World Order
Fuck the shit out her in a sauna
Sweat her hair out, she look like Al Sharpton
Got a goon named Fernando
At the front door your condo
Knock-knock, who's there?
He don't care, he's psycho
Bad bitch with a nice throat
She ice cold and she like hoes
Ooh, she just my type
These other hoes just typos
Young nigga coming back like Jordan
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry
Yeah, a nigga had to go back to the stash
But a nigga 'stache like James Harden
Young nigga drank lean like water
Young nigga smoke weed like Marley
Young nigga on the Moon like Warren
Young nigga on this shit like Charmin
Ooh, my bitch got a rack, Dolly Parton
Fuck her all night long to some Marvin
Fall asleep in the pussy, good lordy
Woke up in a new Bugatti, good mornin'
Young nigga got guns, good luck
Nina Ross say ""Me so horny""
Lil Tunechi, at the top it's so lonely
Got fat pockets, never bony
I'm with a model bitch, she so bony
I done shook shit up, it's so foamy
I just cooked this up, it's still hot
You could still smell the kitchen on me
Nigga I'll have your homies
Singing ""Damn I miss my homie""
I got a mountain of weed
I got a mountain of cash
I got mountains like Wyoming
I got a bad bitch and she foreign
She always mad with me, I'm sorry
She say ""Damn why you can’t call me?""
""Cause they be taxin' for that roaming""
She a tan bitch, she orange
I can’t stand a snitchin' informant
Niggas cooked crack on a Foreman
While y'all boys was still sparrin', uhh
This that Sorry For The Wait 2
Tell the dead homies you pray to
You on your way too
That the truth is hard to swallow
You got fake juice
Even Slick Rick the ruler know I break rules, ooh
Got the gas out shootin' like Jordan
I'll put your homeboy face on a T-shirt
And put your own face on a milk carton
Busy, I’ve been so busy
Ain’t even got time for quickies
That’s why my bitch been so bitchy
I’m out here tryin' to get me
I’m coming back out jumpin' like Jordan
I’m so sorry for the wait, I’m tardy
I wrote a letter to my competition
It started off with: Dearly Departed

This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I'm so sorry, I feel terrible
Yeah, I know I keep on telling you
Leggo

[Verse]
It's all about the Young fuckin' Money
It's a war in these streets, I need a Humvee
That AK-47, that's my trusty
Got some tricks up my sleeves, I need some cufflinks
Oh Lord, these niggas soft, these niggas fluffy
Another one bites the dust 'til his gums bleed
Oh Lord, Public Enemy, Chuck D
Me with no money's like a bunny with no front teeth
Fuck me? It's fuck you if it's fuck me
I hit the kush, blow it out like a bum knee
Where the haters? Point 'em out and ask 'em what's beef
Stack of hundred dollar bills in a scrunchie
Oh Lord, kamikaze, kidnappin' killers
Screaming ""Fuck the other side!""
She ride the dick, the dick gon' kill her, vehicular homicide
Oh Lord, I'm Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga
I'm sorry for them other guys
Lay a nigga down, Nina sang his ass a lullaby
Wave your white flag all you want, bitch, I'm colorblind
Bad bitch with me got thunder thighs and her mother's eyes
Li-li-li-lick my lollipop like it got gum inside
Miami in the winter, Cali in the summertime
My bitch is independent, she don't ask me for a dime
Love it when we makin' love, hate it when it's fuckin' time
Disrespect the caterpillar, rave about the butterfly
Bullet ain't got no name, nigga, but you could get it customized
Run up in your house, undisguised, why you look surprised?
Motherfuckers better fuckin' hide, I feel like Mr. Hyde
Athletes still gettin' jacked like they missin' tires
Oh Lord, one of the wildest B's in my hive
I'll sting a bitch and die anytime
Hate it when the fuckin' police shut the session down
We just talkin', we just skatin', we just messin' round
Tell them niggas that be hatin' we ain't messin' round
They just barkin', they just fakin', they gon' settle down
We got bitches, we got beer, we got Bobby Brown
Skatin' underneath the bridge, dead body found
Do a trick over the body, hope he smilin' down
Do a trick off of some stairs, land on solid ground
Grizzly Gang in this bitch, check the grip tape
Nigga came on your bitch, ooh milkshake
Chop a cocaine brick like a sensei
Break the great white down to a fish plate
Woo! Pockets on inflate
Got the Yay locked down like Kim K
I been sippin' codeine since 10K
I be cussin' while I'm bustin', ""Die motherfuckers""

Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens

We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind

Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together—motherfuckers got they shoes tied together

Whippin' in the kitchen in the trap house with my shirt off
I'ma get these millions and I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talkin' bout the third ward

Got a bad bitch, body curvy like a curveball
Let her drink too much, now her pussy taste like Smirnoff
Sleepin' on chinchilla, boy, I'm cozy like a furball

Now I don't get excited, nigga, I just get exotic
I don't get invited to these bitches pity parties
I don't do narcotic even though a nigga got it
Countin' all this money, I feel like I got arthritis
Baggin' up the work for a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help, before they leave I check their purses
Sorry for the wait, the confusion, the disturbance
Boy, we movin' weight, prostitution, and these verses
Whippin' in the kitchen in the trap house with my shirt off
I'm gon' get these millions and I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talking 'bout the third ward
The DA was a dick and the Judge was a jerk off

[Outro]
We yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Yeah, you hear us yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Blood gang, nigga
And it's that Sorry 4 the Wait 2, woo
And I'm so sorry for the wait too, yeah
Sorry for the wait

Just to let you know that a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave, talking Roots part two and shit
Sorry for the wait

Boy, we do not kill no kids, but your bitch dead (bitch!)
Ooh, shawty like the way that you floss out (ay)
Till I shoot you in the head, now she grossed out (ugh!)

I told a nigga count on me and niggas lost count
This world is only preparation for the next (alright)
Money bags under my eyes, money over rest
Tryna get a hundred M's out the alphabets (uh)
Open up my mouth to smile, ooh, treasure chest (ooh!)
Ooh, DJ Stevie J keep the Glock on him (Stevie J!)

Mama jumped out a plane, I was air-borne (see ya)
Gold watches, gold chains; watch for Leprechauns (what?)

Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Uhh

[Chorus]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Verse 1]
Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets? What's in your pocketbook?
We think the Bible's a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's so good, need a name? Call it ""Milk""
Because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and pussy-ass niggas all day
And I ain't even kinda full

[Chorus]

Woo! I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits
I'll show you my weapon and grill and heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom
She lay down and say, ""Let's make a film""
I be like, ""Action,"" I hold her head down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first, you'll get your family killed, that's if you squeal
Pop-pop, close range, hold that gun
Like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch riding my dick
She swerve 'cause another bitch grabbing the wheel
I ask 'em to chill, they both look at me, say ""Shut up""
I say ""My lips are sealed...""
Oooh! I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in Heaven
When Hell was a pile of wood
I run through Hell with gasoline drawers on
Stop, tell the Devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure
Vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, every day Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese
Been on my beast since I was wearing Wallabees
Where paparazzi? I need my privacy
Fuck your photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get my good side of me, Lord!
I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make a movie 'bout Hollygrove
Woo! Whoever play me
Should get a Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain’t no movie, this is real shit
I don’t need a script 'cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort, more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets
But got ""superstar"" written all over my face
That's why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
I ain't finished shooting, tell 'em don't check the gate
[Chorus]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her she say ""Hallelujah!""
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood

[Verse 3]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
""Lord please don’t let this car break down""
Hahahaha
H-Town! Lord, I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th Ward bitch that be boostin'
Sometimes she doze off, that’s the lean, I excuse it
She said ""If it ain't ch-chopped and screwed, it ain't music""
She say I never take her out, we went to eat at Houston's
Sometimes I doze off, that's the lean, I'm just snoozin'
I still got Actavis, nigga, that's exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that's a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life, had to do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work
Praying the car don’t break down
Ohhh, Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth
With, codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don't give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon' put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper protecting my livelihood
I'm so good, I'm so straight, I'm secure
[Chorus]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

But we ain't worried, we just look the other way

Right in the skate park, riding on your skateboard

If I'm tripping, it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates
And with that said, I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench
And with that said... bitch you jealous
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers
I think I should headline Coachella
My woman a Queen like Coretta
And nigga you sleep with the Devil
I couldn't be Junior forever
I don't mean to ruffle your feathers
But I had to spread my wings
Ain't trying to get lemon-peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues
Too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in
Like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like ""Un momento""
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I'd rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk
My do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk
As long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like; pussy, money, and weed
She say ""Ooh, I like your cologne""
The last niggas tested us flunk
So please study hard, study long
Kill your wife, then take the bitch phone
And text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood
Look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls
I hope you run into your own
Nigga
I come with that heroin flow
I come with that never before
My CMB days are dead
I ain't worried 'bout ghost
I married the MOB, we divorced
Hoo, and all that shit dead without me of course
It's nothing; a zombie, a corpse
You burnt yourself and was supposed to pass me the torch
Fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes, nigga
I'm sorry for the fucking wait
Was busy, searching my calendar for better days
I found 'em, you either turn the page or tear the page

Okay I'ma throw a tantrum on this beat
Now who wanna play fetch?
When it comes to the drugs, boy we shop at Payless
Shawty came too many times, left the whole bed wet
Mack the thinker, I'm the Blood - Method Man, Redman
A scared man a dead man, can I get a amen
You done bought all of them guns and ain't nobody dead yet
Catch your pussy ass in traffic, aim at the headrest
Got your bitch on her knees lookin' like she legless
Like I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust the clique I ride for
If I see 'em in the streets I'ma have to treat 'em like a rival
I'm a pleasure to your eyeballs
I'm so fly I shop at Skymall
Mama never bought me knockoffs
Lord I need some wood to knock on
Lil Tunechi, I'm a movie, get your gummy bears and popcorn
I got somethin' very hot on my hip, I get my hip hop on
And this little red dot gon' help me hit a nigga spot on
Point guard with the bullets; you say Rájon, I say Rajon
Yeah, hold up; we them boys, we them wild boys
I hold a pistol sideways when I shoot, that's for style points
Menace to society, menace to myself though
Bend but don't break, my niggas call me elbow
And you don't want no problem, I'm a problem
My AK just keep shootin', it's on autopilot
Tunechi what's your fuckin' problem? I got fuckin' problems
Bad bitch on top of me, she started from the bottom
On that Cognac and that loud pack, that loud pack
You gotta shoot the rat when it get too big for the mousetrap
Shoot at me and I'ma smile back and then I'll ""Pow"" back
Flip you over like a kayak, bitch it's combat
Bitch I'm Tommy Gun Tunechi
Favorite color ruby
Made enough to quit but I keep makin' up excuses
Triple A dick, that's Amazin' And Amusin'
I'm sedated and secluded
I'm the greatest and improvin'
But my baby mama say I'm livin' wrong
Well if I die then I guess she dead right
Catch me walkin' on this mothafuckin' water, nigga
I'll catch your pussy ass at a red light
And you gon' hear that blocka, that blocka
I represent my killers like Johnnie Cochran
We kidnap mamas and toddlers

Spread your legs, girl, I'm tryna break the headboard

My whole crew'll skate on you like a hockey team
It's like Wayne Gretzky meets Jeremy Shockey
We Young Money Mafia, I rep what I rep
Try to throw salt on my name and I'll put pep in your step
Put your gloves on, nigga please get you a grip
And I bet you rest in peace when I let this bitch rip
The money runnin' like water, check the cash flow
My weed funky like armpits and assholes
Potato on the nine, when we creep we mash slow
And make sure them kids get everything they ask for
My bitch in London said she's a Mack Mainiac
And her sister love Tune, she a Wayniac
It's like she's two different persons; she be chillin', she be cursin'
Cry a river, squirt a ocean
Fuck fast, in slow motion

With my first hundred Gs bought my mom a house
Bitch, don’t try to suck my dick if you got cotton mouth
Watch these snitches, man, these rats think they Mighty Mouse
In the kitchen, Arm & Hammer, just the right amount
Got the dope spot popping, dope spot jumping
Car parked by itself, robot stunting
And it’s voice activated, I just tell it something
I ain’t even gotta press a button
Viper with the rally stripes, I don’t eat no Rally’s
I don’t eat my words, nigga, I don’t eat no salad
I got too much on my plate, I got too much on my palate
Never seen my car before, it’s like a unicorn in traffic
Too much fucking talent, rap Shakespeare, go Hamlet
You other boys could kiss the game goodbye, be romantic
Please don’t worry, Nancy, all my weed is organic
If my children end up smoking
I'll whip they ass if they don’t pass it
Hold up, I just got a package
I let my bitch test it, with flying colors, passed it
Burning money fast like fire on the plastic
You dead man walking throw some tires on your casket
They say niggas in wheelchairs is half dead as it is
I still keep the heat on me, attitude cavalier
Boy, I think your whole clique’s Summer’s Eve, Massengill
Monastat 7, Vagisil
And my name don’t need no adjectives
And my flow don’t need no ad-libs
The boot, the battlefield
Flag red, like I’m Russian, call me Vladimir
Took a picture with the pistol, gave it rabbit ears
These niggas got fast careers, fast as Batmobiles
My bitches got sex appeal, they like sex and pills, for reals
I’m sorry if you hate you, and I’m sorry for the wait, too

He buy one, I front him one, so I left two there
In a two-seater, pull up popping 2Pac
Didn’t have a safe, so I stashed it in my tube sock
Eat so much Benihana's I need nunchucks
You just a old nigga always saying, ""Big bruh""
You a bad bitch always saying, ""Big Daddy""

London on da Track, bitch!

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
We catch a body and we laugh about it
I fucked her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Grinding, it's agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet
Ooh, I lost my mind, I'm like ""Fuck everybody!""
Yeah, I lost my mind, but I got extra copies
Yeah, I fuck so long, it feel like exercising
I'll test a lion before testifying
All I got is hitters in my squad
I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
I want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Zero fucks given
I make her come to the condo butt naked 'cause, bitch, ain't no stealin'
She still come visit, she don't wan' leave
She compared it to me leaving a witness
I said, ""I get it,"" I keep some cocaine on me for the bitches
And this AK is not for decoration
Fuckboys give me the heebie-jeebies
I got a hit list like the Yellow Pages
Hey, if she can suck a dick and snort a Quaalude
Then, ooh, baby, you got my full attention
Champagne expensive, it taste good or vintage
Open your nose, I'll put some sugar in it
I don't fuck around with them fuck-arounds
Uh, I might fuck around and catch a body
Yeah, I got some niggas that'll hunt you down
Yeah, and catch you slipping like you playing hockey
Woo! We catch a body and we laugh about it
Yeah, I fuck her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Uh, money and drugs, I'm talkin' math and science
Ooh, skinny tires, on a salad diet
Chopper leave you with a half a body
Make sure he dead, before we leave, my nigga, grab his wallet
Ooh, I got the hook up on them rocket launchers
I told Obama, ""Fuck with me, you know I got it""
Slime, you need to fuck with me, you know I got it
I know somebody that know somebody
Look, traffic dying, we still trap-or-dying
It's agonizing but it's gratifying
Squad! I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
Want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Hold up, you ain't got no hitters in your squad
I could get you killed, that's my real day job
I'm a crime of passion, I'm a fucking hate crime
Spit like I ate bombs, Eminem on 8 Mile
I'm the motherfucking man, Scarface, Facemob
Pockets looking like The Blob, chips like Cape Cod
Bust your motherfucking egg 'til I see egg nog
My bougie bitch ratchet, my ratchet bitch a straight snob
Hold up, who know how to read gang signs?
Cause we gon' throw 'em up and we gon' give 'em hang time
I got white, I got brown, sell it at the same time
That's that James Brown, and that's that James Bond, ooh
We catch a body and we laugh about it
It's catastrophic but we glamorize it
It's agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet, ooh!
Chopper leave you with a half a body
No hesitation, no stall, like the bathroom crowded
Chopper so big, so tall, it could wrap around me

Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Should've  been in N.W.A., fuck the police, Five-0 and 12
One time for your mind, bitch, never say ""Nevermind,"" bitch
You a penny short of a dime, bitch, no nonsense
Had a nine since I was nine, bitch

Tell 'em boys ain't nothin' sweet, it's sauerkraut, ya heard me?

[Intro/Piano Solo]
*lighter flick*
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
I'm in the crib butt-naked, bitch
She say my dick could be the next Black president
Americans hate that I'm American
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints
Ugh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy
Shoot you in your fucking mouth and make you talk to me
Yeah, sometimes, I need someone to talk to
'Cause I am not a human being—part two!
Getting paid show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick: carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Ugh, what your man doing?
I pop his motherfucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed
And last night, I took a transformer
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl was sleeping with Decepticons
Money talks, man, and mine talk lecture-long
P-U-S-S-Y: my second home
I be grinding on them hoes like a half-pipe
She say, ""Tunechi, you the shit; you need your ass wiped""
I say, ""Before you gas me up, check the gas price""
Then I make her take this dick like advice, hahaha
She seesaw it, she suck it and enjoy it
I stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids
Jose Canseco, make no mistake
Like a white boy wearing black paint, you're a fake-ass nigga
Brake pads, nigga, wait
You ain't in my weight class, nigga
Looking for the motherfucking man in the mirror
Running this shit like a faucet: Farrah
Barra-cuda, who the fuck you are?
I can make your bitch root for me like I grew her
Bodies in the sewer, tampons in manure
Ninety billion bitches on my stick like a skewer, that's swag
I'm a true Blood, bitch, no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm going pro-pane
Tell a bitch, ""Get off me!"" Bitch, get off me!
I got her over here blowing me like coffee
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated, haha
Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer Bs, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers, it's so strange
But this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head—what's that? A no-brainer
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I'd rather wring your fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass—get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer or warm air
Man... Nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in your shoe and scramble
No rubber, I just fucked this piano, nigga!

I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah, nah
And I'm laughing at them pussy niggas
And that pussy shit they doin'

My nigga Drake he Jewish
I swear to god I ain't nervous, nah, hahah
Okay I swear to God I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
I say, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin and slurping my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch, for certain
I see you turnin up but your turn up ain't workin
Just want some mouth and lip service
And I got all my niggas in that truck like an Excursion

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay I'm straight at you, no ricochet
That pussy boneless, that's Chick-fil-a
I fuck with real riders and they tickets paid
For them dead presidents, we will start digging graves
I swear my momma trust my work
So I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get murked
And my pants sagging like fuck it - I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green
Mane my niggas got them birds, you ain't even got bird seeds
Your bitch ride me like a go kart, I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts then after that they worthless

I like em long haired and curvy
And if niggas think it's a game
I'll leave they brains on their jerseys

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She say she love me, that's the molly talking
She about to blow me, like a signing bonus
She got a nigga but he ain't me bitch
I'm the original gangster, he the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money, Obama
It's fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
But I swear to God he heard it, yeah
And I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah
I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
Baby, I just want some mouth and lip service
She gone ride this dick like the Kentucky Derby

[Verse 3: Boo]
On that Pat-ron, I'm swerving, game tight like virgins
I got a bad bitch, she Persian, call her AK when she's squirting
You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi
All my chicks be bougie
Wanna hold hands then watch movies
I be goddamned, make a nigga lose it
Ain't no talking- lets get to it
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing
Bitch I'll leave that pussy with bruises

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I swear to God I ain't nervous
No, you know I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin and slurping, my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain

Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither (But hey)
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers (But hey)
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers (But hey)
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeño (Hey)
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket (But hey)
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip (But hey)
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter (But hey)
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tapeworm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big-headed, my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz & Lydia Pense]
(But hey) Yeah, 2 Chainz (But hey)
I might book me for a show (But hey)
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough (But hey)
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures (But hey)
I like math, all I did was add bitches (Hey)
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours (But hey)
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle (Hey)
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in (Hey)
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me (With me)
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it (Damn)
Everything authentic (Tru), plus I named my pistols

Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered

Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear’ll have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I’ll send them up Schitt’s creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's okay if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it

Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
And I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you, back-back

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a drive-by, I'm real, these niggas sci-fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplatin' short hair
She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoein', but she the only one worth knowin'
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, ""Okay, I'm your honor""
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass, I just be like, ""Come sit your groceries on my counter""
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I'm dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9

Uh, I got that shit in my system, somebody gon' be my victim

I got that good-good, that get right, that early morning, that midnight
I beat it up like a fist fight: one, two, three, four, five, 6-9
That dick all in your windpipe, some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee

I ain't lookin' back, nigga
I'm a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my drawers but I nail your bitch
Blunts like fingers, I'm 'bout to make a fist
Everybody die, gon' bury me alive
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Motherfucker it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone

Ugh, AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear, with these fifty shots, I'll shoot it out with Five-O
Pockets gettin' too fat, no Weight Watchers, no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga, you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose-pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talking, we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind your back like nunchucks, and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches
And that's 2 Chainz

I graduated to better drugs, my cap and gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse, what I do is my choice

Shoutout to my weed man, shoutout to my lean man
Pussy ass nigga wanna spark something, I'm a gasoline can
I'm high nigga, don't blow it, I trust it far as I could throw it
I don't know if I'm coming or going, T, make my blunt a Samoan
And I see lights flashin', life passin', take a bitch home, fuck like rabbits
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses, shot glasses, hot flashes
My tongue numb, I can't talk, no balance, my spine hurts
My mind surf, my eye jerks, I try different drugs, I'm diverse
Goodbye Earth, farewell, high as Heaven, eyes low as Hell
Keep scratching, keep biting my nails
Keep lighting a L, I'm a kite in the air
I like weed brownies and cookies, I'm straight but seeing crooked
I got my trippy kit, I hope I trip and fall in some pussy
Tunechi

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Musty herb in a Ziploc, twistin' up top notch
Weed that I smoke, straight off a boat
Six foot bong, tryna see what I toke
This that Cali Kush, I motivate not gloat
All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna get some Becky in the backseat of the Ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then I laugh
In your baby mama ear, and I'm gonna smash
They call me the trippy king, don't try me nigga
Juicy J with the Taylors, Chinese eyes, nigga

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit

The stars on the flag are never shinin'

Will I die or go to jail today?
'Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'

Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say, ""Fuck the police,"" now I say, ""Fuck jail""
Same shit, different air freshener
I don't play, boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind

I keep that iron, you can get creased
And if she say she didn't fuck—bitch, you're lying through your teeth
They say, ""It cost to be the boss""
The ones in jail wish they were free
Niggas call me ""Hi-C"" because I'm high, as you can see
Niggas say they paid they dues; well, I'm checking your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, ""Who but me?""
Got your bitch bent over, nigga—hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
'Cause all my niggas well rounded
Don't fuck with none of these square niggas
Mask on, Ghostface Killah, draw down and erase niggas
I'm a Blood, is you a blood donor? Swisher full of that California
I hit it sideways: caddy-corner
Then she catch that nut like pneumonia—Lil Tunechi!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Lay it down, ho (Haha), lay it down, bitch
Lay it down, ho, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Put the money on the couch, nigga
Give me everything up in your house, nigga, shut your mouth, nigga
Put the money on the couch nigga
Give me everything up in your house, nigga, shut your mouth, nigga (Yeah)

Tryna get paid too soon, one deep

Bad lil' ho, high-yellow, brand new Rolie, Sky Dweller
Just left from Dubai, flew private-eye
I made a million dollars, swear to God, that ain't no lie
I said, them niggas was popping, fake niggas be watching
My black glove be dripping wet, but I got my Cochran
Losing ain't no option, I'm teaching bitches my doctrine
The Maybach ain't poppin, if it ain't got no par-tah-tion

I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition
I said, ""Oops, I mean 'partition,; it's all a part of my vision

But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And soon she's gonna find someone to love
And you gon find yourself, so all alone

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
One minute she love me, the next minute she hate me
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted
She say she pray she have Weezy F's baby
And I be having seizures, but she say she can't shake me
And my homies say she's cuter than my other bitches
And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom-fitted
I swear I like her more than she think I do
Girl, when I think of you
My dick just start to jumpin' like a fucking kangaroo
I suck and fuck and finger you
But you want me to cling to you
And I ain't asking you to change
Cause I know I can't jingle you
I got my ways...
And you have your days...
And we gave it our best shot
But I just got grazed
I'm sorry

Man, fuck them bitches and them hoes
And them niggas pussies, camel toes
I got some money on me, and the weed nice
My shit won’t ever stop, suck my green light
Bitch it’s Carter 4, murder's all she wrote
Now it’s fuck everybody, like a Scorpio
Still running shit, I’m on my cardio
Boy I’m going in, like my water broke
Suicide note, suicide doors
I put in overtime, like a tied score
Tinted windows bitch, that mean mind yours
And the weed loud, like a lion's roar
Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever
Hear no evil see no evil, Helen Keller
No music on, rock it acapella
And I don’t need a watch, the time is now or never
Tell my niggas love, I die behind this shit
A nigga counting money, you niggas counterfeit
Real nigga nigga, proud of what I am
Young Money is an army, bitch I’m Uncle Sam
Them hoes call me Tunechi, mama call me Tune
I left the bullshit in the waiting room
Straight to the money, no short cuts
Now watch me go retarded, yellow short bus
We do drive-bys, we do walk-ups
And bitch I be so high, I get starstruck
Millz in this bitch, he said fuck them hoes
And the jewelry bright, like summer clothes
And I keep some bud, like Rudy Huxtable
I’m bout to slam the beat, nigga Dusty Rhodes
I’m from eagle street, I go Hercules
I get on the beat, murder 1st degree
YMCMB, we don’t give a fuck
You faker than some titties, you get tittie fucked
This the best worst feeling
And nigga if I die I die a death worth living
This that text book G shit

If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong

Faded off the kush, I'm gone
Only two years old when daddy used to bring them hookers home
Looking like my grandma, my niggas got that ammo
We jack-son and then light up the L, Samuel
Tunechi in this bitch, nigga, y'all niggas bitch niggas
Rats gon' rat, and snakes gon' hiss, nigga
Baseball rich, nigga, do this shit for all my homies
Where them bad bitches at? Come and put that pussy on me
Tunechi, you a murderer, boy, you just be killing shit
Yeah, you know that money talk, I am the ventriloquist
Tranquilizer in the trunk, put your ass to sleep, man
Birdman Junior, got the world in my wingspan
How you niggas want it? Have it your way, Burger King
I get deep in that pussy, dig her out, surgery
Fucking with a real nigga, fucking right, certainly
Break in your fucking home, take your life, burglary
Whoa, nigga, die slow, nigga
For dear life you're holding on, En Vogue, nigga
Unload, nigga, reload, nigga
Tools on deck, Home Depot, nigga
Well, if life is a bitch, then mine a gold digger
Yeah, and all my bitches nasty, like a cold dinner
Every day I go so hard and work my ass off
I'm good, I'm 100, like a fastball

That AK sleep on the side of my bed
That's one eye closed, one eye open
Your cap get peeled, like ibuprofen
I'm sick, I'm ill, I ain't the nigga to fuck with
It's a crazy world, and life is shorter than Bushwick
Young Money, man, we got this shit by a land slide
Boy, I send them Bloods at your ass, like a tampon
Uptown shit, wet the whole party
Weezy gon' ball, bal' like Steve Harvey
The heater, I'ma tuck her; Tucker like Delores
That's my word, word like thesaurus
I don't see no future in your fronting, I be stunting hard
Rap game dependent on me, like a bungee cord
Fear nobody, but God almighty
Shoot that motherfucker 'til I get arthritis
I'm a beast, I'm a ass, I'm ahead of my class
I'm a diamond in the rough, like a baby in the trash
I don't talk it, I live it; I paint a picture, vivid
And them pistols popping, like they sitting in a skillet
I go so hard, go so mean, I'm so New Orleans
Told the judge I couldn't budge, it was him or me

Ahem
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side
Bitch, I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga

Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t shittin' roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I’m looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended
Pause, like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters: I’m a shooting star
Life is a course, and I'ma shoot for par
Searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, man, I’ll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR, Blood like a scar
Weezy F. Baby and the ""F"" ain't for ""Flaw""

Uh, uh
Yep, yep

[Verse 2]
It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah, the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser

I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track: train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the ""F"" is for ""Fuck yourself""

[Outro]
Uhh, yeah
And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there

Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas (go figure)
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch-ass bitches

But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it ""Waynes"" it pours

All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed

And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas

Hot's what it is, watch what the kid drops
I'ma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost
When I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Leavin' nothin' but mothers stuck and plus a coffin to give
What is happening is a merger, different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cookin' and I'm a server
Further, that's what I'ma get doing this
Remember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all and I heard her
Thank you Baby for what became Lil Wayne
He's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name, it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
Really be bussin' up, they thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up, you in the gang, you bang
You drug and touchin' every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign

It’s the pharaoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cairo, lookin’ at stars
So bright in the sky, I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those?
A whole carload, of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don’t feed the Simba
Three’s assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She’s the only girl that was smart e-nough
To call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones? Well tonight then
We gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It’s important that you are more than
Welcome to Tha Carter IV and
Y’all enjoy it, I will go ‘head
And I’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead, out20Embed"

""Just saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy""

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
.44 bulldog, my motherfuckin' pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker, ""Fetch""
I'm fuckin' her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth, and ass, call that bitch triple-threat
When I was in jail, she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset
Been fucking the world, and nigga, I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch, I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

[Chorus: Rick Ross + Lil Wayne]
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
Yeah, load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

I'm swimming in a yellow bitch (Boss)
In the red 911 looking devilish (Haha)
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof 'til he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before (Yeah)
Baby, I'm the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected, got killers off in Chicago

[Verse 1]
Uhh, I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He say he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said ""You's an ill nigga""
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

Uhh, down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble, better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Uh, smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah I know your name (hey!) yeah

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

You who are rich and whose troubles are few

What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
'Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin' the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing

Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say ""who that?""
Big Bun Beeda but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix, man, just gon' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand with no easy fix, man (damn)
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar and hoes in the crib
Drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with P.A. so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
Said we do it for the Pimp so no holding back, let's go!
[Verse 2: Nas]
Look who crept in, crept-crept in
Look-look who crept in, look-look who
L-l-l-look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB 'til the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants
Like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seem
To get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper
Now it's Chandon, fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight
That my crown ain't for testing, testing
Chop heads off like King Henry the Eighth
Guillotine to your neck, bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wildin' dude
Studied Taoism and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet, seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
But yo, my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate, 'cause like my nigga Drake say
""We ain't got time to respond to niggas""

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta when I pop up with them poppers, burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood, Bl-Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fire
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die, until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed Do-or-Die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company, and Weezy the boss!

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Hm... Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth
Got 'em sayin' ""There he goes again!""
See now, they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistaking
How I be breakin' up everything
And be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (Damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door

I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like, ""Hey, I like the view from here!""
I'm so high, I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho
That's why I go hard, ho

[Verse 1]
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up, like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight
I'm a Southerner's delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive

Cause promises are broken, but tomorrow isn't promised
Think I'm gettin' sick, I'm feelin' ill-egal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's Dr. Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
I need some wall-paper, before they start to fuss
Yeah, pick up the phone and call your bluff
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
I don't think about the future, it come soon enough
Motherfucker, I don't shoot ya; bitch, I shoot ya up
I ain't like these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint, like Spike Lee, nigga
And I woke up this morning, got the cold out my eyes

It's all there papa, you ain't even got to measure

Well, what goes around comes around, propellers

But she gon' probably try to cross the line like a Mexican

Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow

Ooh girl, I love you so
Good lord almighty, I’m in love with a whitey
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her
And she give me good love 'til my nose start bleeding
Life is just like moving mountains
When I can’t cope, I’m hittin’ that slope
That great white hope, and it ain't no pressure
I can’t feel nothing, but I never felt better
Hmm, but you were just no good for me
Killin’ me softly, that girl is poison
Huh, I had to let you go, take things slow
Just so you know

I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (Like novacane)

Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (Like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (LIke novacane)
Like novacane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Sweet sugar hill, yeah I used to climb her
I never imagined she'd turn out to be but a cheap thrill
That sweet turned to sour, she gave me power
The world was ours
I used to feel invincible on that flour
But I had to change, Yeah, I had to change
So I left her for a bitch named Mary Jane
Now everything's cool, everything's fine
Girl, I'm moving on, I done left you behind
Every now and then you pop up on my mind
I might fuck you one last time, 'cause—
[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf & Lil Wayne]
I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (Like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (LIke novacane)
Like novacane

I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I don’t be politicin', I’m not political
Fuck you talkin' about? bitch I’m Kenneth Cole
My goons masked up, Rey Mysterio
Bitch, eat somethin', I don’t like skinny hoes
I hit her from the back, she on her tippy toes
I smoke that Green Day, I’m on my Billie Joe
I’m a dog bitch: B-I-N-G-O
I’m a rich ass nigga, you bitch ass nigga
I’m from the school of Hard Knocks, you skipped class nigga
Tell her bust that pussy open, bend it over bring it back
Get some brain out that ho and call that ho a ""brainiac""

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
Fuck you talkin' about? bitch I’m Kenny Cole
I’m a dog bitch: bingo
Every bad bitch love me, I’m Young Money
Tell em pop that pussy for me, pop that pussy for me
And my niggas got the guns, they're aimin' at your skully
Tell them: ""pop that pussy for me""
Pop that pussy for me !

Yeah
If you a bad bitch, say ""fuck them other hoes!""
I’m in my lane bitch, you a gutter bowl
Boogers in the watch, it got a runny nose
I like a pink pussy, just like a bunny nose
And we are Young Money, the untouchables
I hit her from the back, I make her touch her toes
I’m on that drink baby, I think I’m comotosed
I’m feelin' real good, Stevie Wonder-ful
And everybody with me strapped, tell them hoes adapt
Shoot ‘em in his head, he dead before he collapse
Young Money we the crap, no salary cap
Money talks bitch and mines yap, yap, yap
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
If you a bad bitch, say fuck them other hoes
I’m feelin' real good, Stevie Wonder-ful
And we don’t talk about it, we do it, do it, nigga
Shit can get ugly, Patrick Ewing, nigga
Them niggas can’t see me, but I see through them niggas
And fuck the police, on or off duty nigga

[Interlude: Birdman]
Yeah
Young Money gunnas
Cash Money mobsters
Headshots, one on top
Top flow
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
I’m on some other shit, I’m stuntin' on them hoes
Bitch I’m smokin' pot, like I’m on the stove
I’m in this bitch, bitch, I’m so Hollygrove
Them hoes treasure me, like a pot of gold
Boy, you thin crust, fuckin' Dominoes
I’m laughin' to the bank, this shit is comical
We do it real big, astronomical
I make her fall for me, bitch, Geronimo
Now get it poppin for a nigga, show me what you’re workin' with
I’m fly as a mothafucker bitch, no turbulence
Please know my niggas got them pistols for emergencies
I’m lookin' for a head doctor for some brain surgery
Some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I’m laughin' to the bank, this shit is comical
I make her fall for me, bitch, Geronimo
50 shots in a chopper, break em off proper
You niggas can’t see me, fuck yo binoculars
