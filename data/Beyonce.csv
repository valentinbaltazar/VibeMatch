Nothin' really ends
For things to stay the same, they have to change again
Hello, my old friend
You change your name, but not the ways you play pretend
American Requiem
Them big ideas (Yeah), are buried here (Yeah)
Amen
[Chorus]
It's a lot of talkin' goin' on
While I sing my song
Can you hear me?
I said, ""Do you hear me?""

[Pre-Chorus]
Looka there, looka there now
Looka there, looka there
Looka-looka, looka there, looka there
Looka-looka, looka there, looka there
Looka-looka, looka there, looka there (Oh)
Looka-looka, looka there, looka there (Yeah)

[Chorus]
It's a lotta chatter in here
But let me make myself clear (Oh)
Can you hear me? (Huh)
Or do you fear me? (Ow)

Can we stand for something?
Now is the time to face the wind (Ow)
Coming in peace and love, y'all
Oh, a lot of takin' up space
Salty tears beyond my gaze
Can you stand me?
(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)
Ooh, ah
Can we stand?
(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?
Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)
Can you stand with me?

[Chorus]
Can we stand for something?
Now is the time to face the wind
Now ain't the time to pretend
Now is the time to let love in

[Bridge]
Thinkin' to myself (Thinkin' to myself)
Oh, it's a lot of talkin' goin' on (Oh)
While I sing my song (Yeah)
Do you hear me when I say?
Do you hear me when I say? Ah
[Pre-Chorus]
Looka there, looka there
Looka, look
Looka-looka-looka-looka-looka
Looka-looka there, looka there

Can we stand for something?
Now is the time to face the wind (Now is the time to face the wind)
Now ain't the time to pretend
Now is the time to let love in (To let love in)
Together, can we stand?

[Verse 2]
Looka there, looka in my hand
The grandbaby of a moonshine man
Gadsden, Alabama
Got folk down in Galveston, rooted in Louisiana
Used to say I spoke too country
And the rejection came, said I wasn't country 'nough
Said I wouldn't saddle up, but
If that ain't country, tell me what is?
Plant my bare feet on solid ground for years
They don't, don't know how hard I had to fight for this
When I sang my song
[Outro]
(When I sang the song of Abraham)
(When the angels guide and take my hand)
(Oh, no)
Goodbye to what has been
A pretty house that we never settled in
A funeral for fair-weather friends
I am the one to cleanse me of my Father's sins
American Requiem
Them big ideas (Yeah) are buried here (Yeah)

Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight

[Verse 1]
At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to leave my home at an early age
I saw Mama prayin', I saw Daddy grind
All my tender problems, had to leave behind

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been umpteen summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, gotta choose myself
Undеrpaid and overwhelmed
I might cook, clеan, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows

Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight

[Verse 2]
Sixteen dollars, workin' all day
Ain't got time to waste, I got art to make
I got love to create on this holy night
They won't dim my light, all these years I fight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been thirty-eight summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, now I miss my kids
Overworked and overwhelmed
I might cook, clean, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows
[Chorus]
Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all these tears I fight

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh

[Bridge]
At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to take care of home at an early age
I saw Mama cryin', I saw Daddy lyin'
Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind
For legacy, if it's the last thing I do
You'll remember me 'cause we got somethin' to prove
In your memory, on the highway to truth
Still see our faces when you close your eyes

[Interlude: Dolly Parton]
Hey Miss Honeybee, it's Dolly P
You know that hussy with the good hair you sing about?
Reminded me of someone I knew back when
Except she has flamin' locks of auburn hair
Bless her heart

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm warnin’ you, don't come for my man (Jolene)
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Don't take the chance because you think you can

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
You’re beautiful, beyond compare
Takes more than beauty and seductive stares
To come between a family and a happy man
Jolene, I'm a woman too
Thе games you play are nothing new
So you don't want no hеat with me, Jolene
We've been deep in love for twenty years
I raised that man, I raised his kids
I know my man better than he knows himself (Yeah, what?)
I can easily understand
Why you're attracted to my man
But you don't want this smoke, so shoot your shot with someone else (You heard me)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm warnin' you, woman, find you your own man
Jolene, I know I’m a queen, Jolene
I’m still a Creole banjee bitch from Louisiane (Don't try me)

There’s a thousand girls in every room
That act as desperate as you do
You a bird, go on and sing your tune, Jolene (What?)
I had to have this talk with you
'Cause I hate to have to act a fool
Your peace depends on how you move, Jolene

[Bridge: Beyoncé & Choir]
Me and my man crossed those valleys
Highs and lows and everything between
Good deeds roll in like tumblin' weeds
I sleep good, happy
'Cause you can’t dig up our planted seeds
I know my man's gon' stand by me, breathin' in my gentle breeze
I crossed those valleys
Highs and lows and everything between
Good deeds roll in like tumblin' weeds
Good and happy
'Cause you can't dig up them planted seeds
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'ma stand by her, she gon' stand by me, Jolene

Your body laid out on these filthy floors
Your bloodstains on my custom coutures
Bathroom attendant let me right in
She was a big fan
I really tried to stay cool
But your arrogance disturbed my solitude
Now I ripped your dress and you're all black and blue
Look what you made me do
[Refrain]
They keep sayin' that I ain't nothin' like my father
But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars
If you cross me, I'm just like my father
I am colder than Titanic water

[Chorus]
Help me, Lord, from these fantasies in my head
They ain't ever been safe ones
I don't fellowship with these fakе ones
So let's travel to whitе chapels and sing hymns
Hold rosaries, and sing in stained glass symphonies
Cleanse me, Holy Trinity
From this marijuana smoke smell in my hair

[Verse 2]
I sashayed my dress
Did my best impression of a damsel in distress
This alcohol and smell of regret
Allured my catch
Outfit too small to hide my scars
Feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads
How long can he hold his breath before his death?

In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand
But in practice, well, some may feel confined
I swear 'fore God, it's 'bout to hit it
Jeeze, oh, ah
WoopRight, right, ah, oh

[Verse 1: Beyoncé & Swizz Beatz]
I ain't in no gang, but I got shooters and I bang-bang (Goddamn)
At the snap of my fingers, I'm Thanos, da-na, da-na
And I'm still on your head, cornrows, da-na, da-na
They call me the captain, the catwalk assassin (Come on)
When they know it's slappin', then here come the yappin'
All of this snitchin', and all of this bitchin'
Just a fishin' expedition, dumb admission
In the kitchen, cookin' up them chickens
Extra leg, but I ain't even tryna kick it
Cunty, country, petty, petty, petty
All the same to me, Plain Jane, spaghetti
No sauce, no sauce (No), too soft, too soft (Uh)
They salty, they shootin', like Curry (One, two, three)
One hand on my holster, then pass it to Hova
Thought it was sweet when they was walkin'
In the backdoor of the kitchen past the dirty dishes
Now we on a mission, tried to turn me to the opposition
I'm appalled 'bout the proposition
Y'all been played by the plagiaristic, ain't gon' give no clout addiction my attention
I ain't no regular singer, now come get everythin' you came for

Time to strike a match and light up this juke joint
One-one-one by one, you hang them high
Your hands are steady and you sleep at night
How did you turn your heart to stone?
I don't want him back, but I can't let go
Hangman, answer me now
You owe me a debt, you stole him from me
I hated you once, I envy you now
Just tell me how, tell me how
(d.a. got that—)

Oh, she got that whoa there, hangman got that whoa there
Don't act like you don't know, giddy up, giddy up (d.a. got that dope)
Don't pay me in gold, giddy up, giddy up
Back outside, I'm on the road, giddy up, giddy up
When the sun goes down (It's night-night, hey)
Can hear her body howl (In the moonlight, hey)
I feel her eyein' me like owls (It's on sight, hey)
Hide your man when the hangman come in town (Ooh, yikes)

She's a tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Make it look so good, try to justify it
Boy, you know they're lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant
Every time I ride it, every time I ride this
I don't like to sit up in the saddle, boy, I got it
Just relax, I got this, I got that exotic
Hips are so hypnotic, I am such a tyrant

Send me some shots, are you with me or not?
Throw it back, shoot up the bar
Then tell the law we don't remember nothin' after that

Hey, hey, ridin' you while we tryna get away
Ridin' you while we tryna catch a wave
That's so sexy and I know it, and I ain't afraid to show it
Baby, I'm goated, baby, I'm glowin'
Hey, hey, on the run, run
Tap me on the shoulder when you reload the gun

Tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it

Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant
[Bridge]
How did you get used to the haunting? (The haunting)
The willing, the missing, the wanting (The wanting)
Dry eyes just send me across the divide
Hangman, teach me how not to cry
How not to cry, how not to cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she got that whoa there, hangman got that whoa there
Don't act like you don't know, yeah, giddy up, giddy up (d.a. got that—)
Don't pay me in gold, giddy up, giddy up
Back outside, I'm on the road, giddy up, giddy up (Hey)

You can hear this body howl (You can hear this body howl)
Giddy up now, diggadont, diggadont
Digga daddy, can't leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone
Damn if I do, dammit if I don't
Lady with a whip, want what she wanna want, okay

[Chorus]
Tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Make it look so good, cowboys justify it
Boy, you know they lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Baby, I just don't sit up in the saddle, boy, I got it
Just relax, I got this, I got that exotic
These hips so hypnotic, I am such a tyrant

Lucchese the boots, check

Bought a Chevy and painted it red
Money long, it can't fit in the bed
It don't matter what nobody says
Country boy 'til the day that I'm dead (Yee-hoo)
You want smoke, I'm the Marlboro man
Cut it out 'fore it get outta hand, ayy

We can take backroads (Take backroads)

Hop on my saddle (Hop on my saddle)

Looka there, looka in my hand
The grandbaby of a moonshine man

Got folk down in Galveston, rooted in Louisiana
Used to say I spoke too country
And the rejection came, said I wasn't country 'nough
Said I wouldn't saddle up, but
If I ain't country, tell me what is?
Plant my bare feet on solid ground for years
They don't, don't know how hard I had to fight for this
When I sang my song
[Outro]
(When I sang the song of Abraham)
(When the angels guide and take my hand)

Goodbye to what has been

Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight

[Verse 1]
At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to leave my home at an early age
I saw Mama prayin', I saw Daddy grind
All my tender problems, had to leave behind

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been umpteen summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, gotta choose myself
Undеrpaid and overwhelmed
I might cook, clеan, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows

To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight

[Verse 2]
Sixteen dollars, workin' all day
Ain't got time to waste, I got art to make
I got love to create on this holy night
They won't dim my light, all these years I fight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been thirty-eight summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, now I miss my kids
Overworked and overwhelmed
I might cook, clean, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows

Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight

On a long back road, all these tears I fight

Oh, oh

[Bridge]
At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to take care of home at an early age
I saw Mama cryin', I saw Daddy lyin'
Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind
For legacy, if it's the last thing I do
You'll remember me 'cause we got somethin' to prove
In your memory, on the highway to truth
Still see our faces when you close your eyes

So many roses but none to be picked without thorns
So be fond of your flaws, dear

But you don't want this smoke, so shoot your shot with someone else (You heard me)

Your body laid out on these filthy floors
Your bloodstains on my custom coutures
Bathroom attendant let me right in
She was a big fan
I really tried to stay cool
But your arrogance disturbed my solitude
Now I ripped your dress and you're all black and blue
Look what you made me do
[Refrain]
They keep sayin' that I ain't nothin' like my father
But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars
If you cross me, I'm just like my father
I am colder than Titanic water

[Chorus]
Help me, Lord, from these fantasies in my head
They ain't ever been safe ones
I don't fellowship with these fakе ones
So let's travel to whitе chapels and sing hymns
Hold rosaries, and sing in stained glass symphonies
Cleanse me, Holy Trinity
From this marijuana smoke smell in my hair

[Verse 2]
I sashayed my dress
Did my best impression of a damsel in distress
This alcohol and smell of regret
Allured my catch
Outfit too small to hide my scars
Feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads
How long can he hold his breath before his death?

Here's to hoping I'll fall fast asleep tonight
And I'll just need to get through this
Born in the darkness, who brings the light?
And I just, I need to get through this
Or just get used to it

[Verse 2: Willie Jones, Beyoncé, Beyoncé & Willie Jones]
I'm goin' down south just for fun, I am the man, I know it
And everywhere I go, I hide my face
From the cowboys in Clovis and the rodeo circus
I came here for a reason, but I don't know the purpose
It's all under the surface

Cowboy Carter
Time to strike a match and light up this juke joint
One-one-one by one, you hang them high
Your hands are steady and you sleep at night
How did you turn your heart to stone?
I don't want him back, but I can't let go
Hangman, answer me now
You owe me a debt, you stole him from me
I hated you once, I envy you now
Just tell me how, tell me how
(d.a. got that—)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she got that whoa there, hangman got that whoa there
Don't act like you don't know, giddy up, giddy up (d.a. got that dope)
Don't pay me in gold, giddy up, giddy up
Back outside, I'm on the road, giddy up, giddy up
When the sun goes down (It's night-night, hey)
Can hear her body howl (In the moonlight, hey)
I feel her eyein' me like owls (It's on sight, hey)
Hide your man when the hangman come in town (Ooh, yikes)

[Chorus]
She's a tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Make it look so good, try to justify it
Boy, you know they're lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant
Every time I ride it, every time I ride this
I don't like to sit up in the saddle, boy, I got it
Just relax, I got this, I got that exotic
Hips are so hypnotic, I am such a tyrant

Send me some shots, are you with me or not?
Throw it back, shoot up the bar
Then tell the law we don't remember nothin' after that
Scot-free (Scot-free), whole city after me
Have you seen her? 5'9'', thick and fine, what a tragedy
Hey, hey, ridin' you while we tryna get away
Ridin' you while we tryna catch a wave
That's so sexy and I know it, and I ain't afraid to show it
Baby, I'm goated, baby, I'm glowin'
Hey, hey, on the run, run
Tap me on the shoulder when you reload the gun

[Chorus]
Tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Make it look so good, try to justify it
Boy, you know they're lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant

[Bridge]
How did you get used to the haunting? (The haunting)
The willing, the missing, the wanting (The wanting)
Dry eyes just send me across the divide
Hangman, teach me how not to cry
How not to cry, how not to cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she got that whoa there, hangman got that whoa there
Don't act like you don't know, yeah, giddy up, giddy up (d.a. got that—)
Don't pay me in gold, giddy up, giddy up
Back outside, I'm on the road, giddy up, giddy up (Hey)

Boy, you know they lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Baby, I just don't sit up in the saddle, boy, I got it
Just relax, I got this, I got that exotic
These hips so hypnotic, I am such a tyrant

[Outro]
One-one-one by one, you hang them high
Your hands are steady and you sleep at night
How did you turn your heart to stone?
I don't want him back, but I can't let go
Hangman, answer me now
You owe me a debt, you stole him from me (Giddy up, giddy up)
I hated you once, I envy you now (Hey)
Just tell me how, tell me how

Each time I see you there
And I miss all our secrets
So tell me how you've been

[Verse 1: Shaboozey]
Lucchese the boots, check
You can hear when I step, step
Bought a Chevy and painted it red
Money long, it can't fit in the bed
It don't matter what nobody says
Country boy 'til the day that I'm dead (Yee-hoo)
You want smoke, I'm the Marlboro man
Cut it out 'fore it get outta hand, ayy
This ain't Calabasas, we don't need highways
We can take backroads (Take backroads)
Never been ridin', baby? Step in that stirrup
Hop on my saddle (Hop on my saddle)
Snake on my feet, they rattle (Ooh)
And the bag, only thing gettin' lasso'd, yeah (Gettin' what?)
And I'm still goin' up like a ladder (Uh)
And I'm still in the field like cattle

You know that I'm gon' be extra
When that camera go, ""Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop""
Keep 'em waitin' like dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot
""Ooh, la-la-la""
That's the way dem boys sound when I walk through the block, block, block
Then I uzi that doozie, shot, shot, shot

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
We was just chillin', mindin' our business
Poppin' our pain and champagne through the ceilin'
Sippin' it up, flickin' it up
All this good energy got you all in your feelings, feelings
I'm crazy, I'm swearin'
I'm darin', your man's starin'
I just entered the country with derringers
'Cause them Karens just turned into terrorists
[Chorus: BEAM, Big Freedia]
He was on stop mode, got froze
Froze front page Vogue, no pose

Chat too much, full clip unload
That's that Kodak energy

Boy, I know you can't help but to be yourself 'round me

I'll always be your secret weapon in your arsenal, your arsenal
And I know you had it rough growin' up, but that's okay (That's okay, baby)
I like it rough (That's okay, baby)
Even when you let your feelings get in the way (Let your feelings get in the way)

If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret, no

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Lifе is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh, takе the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent

Show no fear, boy, where's your spinal?
Where's your backbone? Where's your pyro?
I had to be everything you couldn't be for my survival
My own idol, skipped my trial
Took my rightful, rightful title
No remorse, the sin is final
I found all my own disciples
I'm too far gone, down this spiral
No white angels, just albinos
Check my eyes, man, they're all white, man
Rollin' back now, where'd the light go?
Guess it died, so cold like Cairo
Crack my neck back like I'm the chiro

Then I'll dive in it 'til I am exhausted and I'm type lacking

If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you‚ bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret‚ no

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up‚ don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh‚ take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin'‚ I'm takin' my own advice

[Verse: Beyoncé]
Let Mama let you know (Let you know)
Mama's still tryin'
I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it
I had to say that thing twice (Twice)
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I would fight, so I fight
If you're feelin' frustrated and (Oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (Oh)
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you'll be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me

Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary

You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise

Mansa Musa reincarnated, we on our levels (He 'bout business)
That's a billi', a thousand milli' (Ugh)
First one to see a B out these housing buildings
I be feelin' like Prince in '84 (Ow)
Mike in '79, Biggie in '97, '94 Nas
Ali bomaye, no kumbaya
Just give me the Sommelier (I got it), I'm on La Tâche
Helmet on the jet ski, you know the vibes
Hit my head, figured out me (I love it)
Oh my God, without the God in the XY (Yeah, yeah)
I'm afraid the whole game will be colonized (Yeah, yeah)
The marathon will be televised for N.I.P. (Aww yeah)​
'Cause true kings don't die, we multiply, peace
[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
I'm so unbothered, I'm so unbothered
Y'all be so pressed while I'm raisin' daughters
Sons of empires, y'all make me chuckle
Stay in your struggle, crystal blue water
Piña colada-in', you stay Ramada Inn
My baby father, bloodline Rwanda
Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba
Oshun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother
Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
When we walk up in the club
I need the sirens goin' off
And when you look up to the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
I give 'em goosebumps every time
I throw up my diamond
Together, we big timin'
The children are our reminder

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever
[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Forever and ever
Ever, forever
Forever and ever
Ever and ever and ever
Time to break it down now

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
All praise due
My enemies still pressed
Cannot lose
'Cause I bet on myself
I'm dancin'
Ancestors in my step
Now, I move better, ooh
Energy pourin' out
I feel a change comin' now
Royalty in my blood from the kingdom
The more money, more problems season
But don't you let that get you out your way
Rise up higher
Jump, jump and don't look down
You're so far from the ground
Yeah, yeah-eh-eh-eh

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel

I wonder how and why it went so wrong
It's been so dark, yeah
I wanna say my last goodbyes
And I'll be gone for good
Left you guys behind
Oh, I'm so lonely, so lonely, ooh

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
In the jungle, ain't no bible
Showtime, showtime, no recital
Show no fear, boy, where's your spinal?
Where's your backbone? Where's your pyro?
I had to be everything you couldn't be for my survival
My own idol, skipped my trial
Took my rightful, rightful title
No remorse, the sin is final
I found all my own disciples
I'm too far gone, down this spiral
No white angels, just albinos
Check my eyes, man, they're all white, man
Rollin' back now, where'd the light go?
Guess it died, so cold like Cairo
Crack my neck back like I'm the chiro

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez & 070 Shake]
I want your world at my feet
I want your world at my feet
I've waited too long for this

I want them to bow down to me
I want your world at my feet

You are the living word
Ah, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you‚ bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret‚ no

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up‚ don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh‚ take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin'‚ I'm takin' my own advice

[Verse: Beyoncé]
Let Mama let you know (Let you know)
Mama's still tryin'
I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it
I had to say that thing twice (Twice)
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I would fight, so I fight
If you're feelin' frustrated and (Oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (Oh)
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners

Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah

Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary
You just don't know it yet
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise

[Chorus: Beyoncé & RAYE]

You better think again
Better wake up because

I know my enemy prey on me, so pray for me
Tick, tick, wait on it
I'm keepin' down my body count
I'm finessin' like a trap bounce, a trap bounce, yeah
'Cause every day above ground is a blessing
I done leveled up, now my view panoramic
None of my fears can go where I'm headed
Had to cut 'em loose, now I'm loose, break the levee, yeah
I'm 'bout to flood on 'em, flood on a sinner
The rain and thunder gon' pour
Go Mutumbo, no, no sinner
You can't dim my light

'Cause when we walk up in the club

Show no fear, boy, where's your spinal?
Where's your backbone? Where's your pyro?
I had to be everything you couldn't be for my survival
My own idol, skipped my trial
Took my rightful, rightful title
No remorse, the sin is final
I found all my own disciples
I'm too far gone, down this spiral
No white angels, just albinos
Check my eyes, man, they're all white, man
Rollin' back now, where'd the light go?
Guess it died, so cold like Cairo
Crack my neck back like I'm the chiro

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez & 070 Shake]

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, five-star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard
[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy (Oh no)

Tough girl is what I had to be

Watch out for your sister""

With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible

He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, ""Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""

And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there

You're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human

Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new

Painting white flags blue
Lord, forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, ""Go and fall away, fall away,"" oh
May the last one burn into flames

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose! Yeah

'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, ""Don't move""

Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

Baby, I'm back by popular demand
Bitch, I'm back by popular demand
I did not come to play with you hoes
I came to slay, bitch

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (Stylin')
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces (Woo)
My daddy Alabama, mama Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole, make a Texas bama
I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all this money, but they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag, swag

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow bone it
Dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it
I twirl on my haters, albino alligators
El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser
Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)
Take what's mine (Take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)
'Cause I slay (Slay), I slay (Hey), I slay (Okay), I slay (Okay)
All day (Okay), I slay (Okay), I slay (Okay), I slay (Okay)
We gon' slay (Slay), gon' slay (Okay), we slay (Okay), I slay (Okay)

As a Black woman, I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box. And Black women often feel underestimated. And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. Be proud of the struggle. Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain. Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right. And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty. Thankful for their freedomEmbed"

Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every girl in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how it's looking, babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say ""Speed it up"", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
So why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

[Outro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
But for the attention of men

I wanna sing this last song to all of my incredible, beautiful fans
Loyal fans, ride-or-dies
It's dedicate to my incredible Beyhive

[Verse 1]
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
And I can feel the stars whenever you're near, you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh-woah
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fightin' through my tears
But finally you put me first

[Chorus]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop

Constantly aware of it all

When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight

How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list

Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business

She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy (Oh no)
She already made enough, but she'll never leave

Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business

Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And Daddy made a soldier out of me (Ooh)
Daddy made me dance and Daddy held my hand (Ooh)
And Daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, ""Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister""
And oh, that's when he gave to me

[Chorus]
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, ""Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""
Oh, my daddy said shoot

Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, ""Girl, it's your second amendment"" (Ooh)
He always played it cool, but Daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said, ""Remember...""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He said, ""Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister""
That's when Daddy looked at me

Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

[Verse 2]
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on

Mama
I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to dress and fix your hair
When you smiled through your tears
In the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""

[Chorus]
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and tryin', fightin', cryin'
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine

Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be
To be happy

[Verse 1]
Mama said, ""You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters""
[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South Beach, sugar-free
Vogue says thinner is better
[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
(Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge]
Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's my soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past
[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst (Pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something (Pretty hurts)
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Outro]
When you're alone all by yourself (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
And you're lyin' in your bed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
You stripped away the masquerade (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)196Embed"

[Intro: Beyoncé & Alaina Reed-Hall]
The winner is: Beyoncé Knowles, female pop vocalist
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
And I've been driftin' off on knowledge
Catcalls on catwalks, man, these women gettin' solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder, ""How come?""
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm lookin' off the edge, I preach my gut, it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbin' up the walls 'cause all the shit I hear is borin'
All the shit I do is borin', all these record labels borin'
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
All the people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive, how come?

Baby, put your arms around me, tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble, but I know that's why you're stayin'

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

[Verse 2]
No, I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you lyin'?
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

[Chorus]
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby, oh

[Bridge]
Tell me, do you wanna ride? (Ride, ride, ride)
Tell me, do you wanna ride? (Ride)
Ridin' 'round
Ridin' 'round
Ridin' 'round
Ridin' 'round in that H-town
Keep those candles in your bed, no need for the spell
Stop actin' so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

[Intro]
Let me hear you say, ""Hey, Ms. Carter!"" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Say, ""Hey, Ms. Carter!"" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me somethin'

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe

[Bridge]
Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin', babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say, ""Speed it up,"" I just go slower
High like treble, pumpin' on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seein' 'Yoncé on her knees
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Oh, there, daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down

Red wine drip, we'll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?

I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you not honest
Now you got me yellin', that's because I'm jealous

If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine (Oh, I'm jealous)

Sometimes, I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never, ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
""Baby girl, you can't survive like this""

[Verse 2]
Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy, you been hangin' out at night, tonight, I'm stayin' out 'til tomorrow
Dancin' on them tables, ain't got no cares, no sorrows

Now we reminiscin' how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous

Ooh, grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know that you ready (Ready, ready)
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady

And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

Your challengers are a young group from Houston
Welcome Beyoncé, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly, and Ashley
The hip-hop-rappin' Girls' TYME!
Part I: ""Bow Down""

[Chorus]
I'm out that H-Town, comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground

[Verse 1: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches (Crown)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches
[Bridge: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches (Crown)
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches (Crown)
H-Town vicious, H-H-Town vicious
I'm so crown-crown, bow down, bitches

I'm out that H-Town, comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
Part II: ***Flawless
[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie & Beyoncé]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless)
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
Say, ""I look so good tonight""
Goddamn, goddamn
Say, ""I look so good tonight""
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
My mama taught me good home-trainin'
My daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man make me feel so goddamn fine, I'm flawless
[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless)
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this

And when my voice is screamin' out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standin' in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing's a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Movin' forward

A tough love (Superpower)

Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as handlin' all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do

I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary
Yup, on the 35th of Nevuary
Yup, you love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl
Ooooh, that's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl

Mama
I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to dress and fix your hair
When you smiled through your tears
In the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""

[Chorus]
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and tryin', fightin', cryin'
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off (Woo)

You live and learn, that's just the way life goes

Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(Uh, you a killer, you so sexy)

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to dress and fix your hair
You always smiled through your tears
And in the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish this didn't hurt at all

And then you had enough and you took that ring off (Oh yeah)
You took that ring off (Oh yeah)
So tired of the lies and tryin', cryin', fightin'
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins (Oh yeah)
Dust yourself off and you love again (Oh yeah)
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
[Bridge]
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear, mama
After all them years
We can start all over again, mama
And now it all makes sense
Lettin' go is never the end, mama
We can love again
This is where freedom begins, mama

[Refrain]
So put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody, put your love on top

Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be
To be happy

[Verse 1]
Mama said, ""You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters""
[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Without fallin' down, down, down

We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge]
Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's my soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past
[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst (Pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something (Pretty hurts)
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Outro]
When you're alone all by yourself (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
And you're lyin' in your bed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
You stripped away the masquerade (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)196Embed"

[Intro: Beyoncé & Alaina Reed-Hall]
The winner is: Beyoncé Knowles, female pop vocalist
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
And I've been driftin' off on knowledge
Catcalls on catwalks, man, these women gettin' solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder, ""How come?""
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm lookin' off the edge, I preach my gut, it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbin' up the walls 'cause all the shit I hear is borin'
All the shit I do is borin', all these record labels borin'
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
All the people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive, how come?

Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill

Baby, put your arms around me, tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble, but I know that's why you're stayin'

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

[Verse 2]
No, I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you lyin'?
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

[Chorus]
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby, oh

Tell me, do you wanna ride? (Ride, ride, ride)
Tell me, do you wanna ride? (Ride)
Ridin' 'round
Ridin' 'round
Ridin' 'round
Ridin' 'round in that H-town
Keep those candles in your bed, no need for the spell
Stop actin' so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe

[Bridge]
Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin', babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say, ""Speed it up,"" I just go slower
High like treble, pumpin' on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

I've been watchin' for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh, my, oh, my
Been havin' conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feelin' like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're takin' this a little too far
If we are, we're takin' this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're takin' this a little too far
With me bein' wherever I'm at
Worried 'bout wherever you are
We're takin' this a little too far
We're takin' this a little too far
We're takin' this a little too far

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches (Crown)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted

Part II: ***Flawless
[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie & Beyoncé]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless)
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
Say, ""I look so good tonight""
Goddamn, goddamn
Say, ""I look so good tonight""
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
My mama taught me good home-trainin'
My daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man make me feel so goddamn fine, I'm flawless
[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)

I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Beyoncé, André 3000 & Consequence]

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Set the scene, three thousand degrees
I ain't worried about them, **** **** over there, but they worry about me
I got a homeboy named Butter and another homeboy there, **** named Cheese
**** with me, baby, I'll make it milk 'til it drip down your knees
Spit this **** for real-o, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them, they never forgot and nothin' else really mean nothin' to me
I ain't studyin' the beat, talkin' to me?
Girl, why you **** with me? Move on, ain't nothin' to see
Sh, always somethin' to saw, I'm the raw, off the rip
'Cause of him, all of them, will remember the minute
They fell in love with rap, black like havin' your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm lovin' you, yeah

This is for them twenty-somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them thirty-somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them forty-somethings
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a mother****
This is for them fifty-somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head

[Pre-Chorus]
Mom and Dad tried to hide the world
Said the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of thirteen
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys
I swear, that just made 'em want me more
At fourteen, they asked me what I wanna be
I said, ""Baby, twenty-one, so I get me a drink""

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writin' physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, a-a-all night, ooh
Hot, top, flight, boy, I'm out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, a-a-all night

[Verse 2]
This is for them pretty somethings
Livin' in the fast lane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop livin' in regret, baby, it's not over yet (Yeah, yeah)
And this is for them chipper somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better

One day, you'll run the town
For now, make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'til the fire marshals shut this sucker down (Down)

I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin' (Pa-da, pa-pa, pa-da)

I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

[Verse 2]
I wanna say I lived each day until I die
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

This is for them forty-somethings
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a mother****
This is for them fifty-somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head

[Pre-Chorus]
Mom and Dad tried to hide the world
Said the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of thirteen
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys
I swear, that just made 'em want me more
At fourteen, they asked me what I wanna be
I said, ""Baby, twenty-one, so I get me a drink""

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writin' physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, a-a-all night, ooh
Hot, top, flight, boy, I'm out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, a-a-all night

[Verse 2]
This is for them pretty somethings
Livin' in the fast lane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop livin' in regret, baby, it's not over yet (Yeah, yeah)
And this is for them chipper somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writin' physical love letters (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm a freak, all day, a-a-all night, ooh
Hot, top, flight, boy, I'm out of sight

[Bridge]
You know it costs to be the boss
One day, you'll run the town
For now, make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'til the fire marshals shut this sucker down (Down)

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin' (Pa-da, pa-pa, pa-da)
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better (Ooh)

[Outro]
There's not a real way to live this
For real
Just remember to stay relentless
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop runnin' until it's finished

Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart
I wanna show you how much I hate being apart (Oh yes)
Wanna show you, show you, show you 'til you through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch

This is for the time (Oh) you gave me flowers (Oh)
For the world (Oh) that is ours (Oh)
For the mula (Oh), for the power of love
And no, I won't never, ever, e-ever give you up

The love that's in between the lines, boy, look into my eyes
While I'm grindin' on you (Oh), this is beyond sex (Oh)
I'm high on you (Oh), if it's real, then you know how I feel (Oh)
Rockin' on you, babe, rockin', rockin' on you, babe
Swirlin' on you, babe, in my mind, all I can think about
Is a frame for our future and the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last, oh, woah

Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby

Make love to me when my days look low

Let our love heal us all, right now, baby

Make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns
But I, I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die
But I hope that I'm gon' die by you, hey
And I don't know much about fightin'
But I, I know I will fight for you, hey
And just when I ball up my fist, I realize

There's ups and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain (Chain)
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothin', I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time

Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I wanna treat you right

Daddy, won't you treat him right?

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
We're givin' ya fever
When we kiss ya
Fever if you live and learn
Fever, till you sizzle

No broken-hearted girl

[Verse 1]
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

And still you're in my heart

And yes, there are times when I hate you

Baby
Seems like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, your smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you
Yes (Woo, ow)
So crazy right now
Most incredibly
It's your girl, B (Yes, woo)
It's your boy, Young
You ready? (Ow)
Band, one two three four
Ch-yeah
History in the making
Part two
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame, yeah (Yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
You might also like[Chorus: Beyocé]
(Got me looking so crazy right now)
(Your love's got me looking so crazy right now) Sing
(Got me looking so crazy right now)
(Your touch got me looking so crazy right now) Sing
(Got me hoping you'll page me right now)
(Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now) C'mon
(Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking)

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
(Got me looking so crazy right now)
(Your love's got me looking so crazy right now) So crazy
(Got me looking so crazy right now) Your love
(Your touch got me looking so crazy right now) Hey, he-he-hey

But where I'm 'bout to go (Top of the world, Young Hova, holla)
Now I just wanna love ya! (Just wanna love you, Hov')
But be who I am (You know you love me, Hov')
And with all this cash (Mo' money, mo' problems)
You'll forget your man

(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff) Gimme that
(But don't bullshit me) Yeah
(C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff) Yeah

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
When the Remy's in the system, ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck 'em? Will I diss 'em? That's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin', I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Cris', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
And I—, and I—, and I—, uh
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Cris'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say? Me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion?
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci, huh
Filth Mart jeans, take that off
[Interlude: Beyoncé]
Katty blow your horn now
Give it up for Jay y'all
Patton, blow your horn, ow

Let me hear my horn
I hope ya won't mind

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I’d kick it with who I wanted, ha
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they’d stick up for me
Sing

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin’ alone (Yeah, right)
I’d put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she’d be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home
To come home
To come home
You might also like[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake, think I’d forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Interlude]
I want you to know that I'm happy for you
And I want nothing but the best for you both
Another version of me, Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Baby, were you thinking of me when you—, sing
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died? 'Til you died
But you're still alive
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away, sing
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

[Chorus]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you love got destroyed
[Outro]
But you're just a boy2Embed"

Can y'all please give it up for the incomparable Kanye West?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl
'Cause every thing I throw up, blow up
Talkin' to the girl, she said, ""Know what? Grow up, you nasty,""
I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standin' next to Jay who standin' next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
That's good for my ego, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, just listen to piano

Let me see, Bibi
Now, this song is not only for the ladies, it's also for the fellas too
Sometimes in relationships, people get real, real comfortable and forget they can be replaced in a minute
So what I wan you to do is imagine that person, and this is your opportunity to give them a piece of your mind
But, I want you to sing it like they're right in front of you
Are you ready? Sing
To the left, to the left
It's your turn, London, come on
To the left, to the left
Ah, you can do better than that, sing
To the left, to the left
Alright, that's more like it, but I still want it louder
To the left, to the left
Ow, I gotta hear that one more time

[Verse 1]
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please, don't touch
And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
That was so beautiful, y'all
You're irreplaceable, hey

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was puttin' you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me (Me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

[Bridge]
So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you, no, no (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep, ha-ha
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy
[Interlude]

I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sendin' me a drink ain't appeasin', believe me (Believe me)
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)

And I'ma help you build up your account (That's a good look)

And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule, I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo, ooh

[Verse 2]
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule, I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
(Everywhere I'm lookin' now) Everywhere we lookin' now
(I'm surrounded by your embrace) Surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace

That was the night I experienced the magic of Michael Jackson
Everyone, I want you to put your lighters in the air
Put your glowsticks in the air, put your cellphones in the air
And help me celebrate Michael's life
Come on
[Chorus]
'Cause everywhere we lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
'Cause Michael, we can feel your halo

I love how you approach me
Fresh white, with your pants, hanging grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin’ good to me
No need to convince me anymore
Swagger, it's right, one blade is tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby, you doin' somethin' right
You just cancelled every other man here
You say you love my bag, and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'm gon' leave my number on your video phone
