[Chorus]
Don't stop
Trying to find me here amidst the chaos
Though I know it’s blinding, there's a way out
Say out loud
Will not give up on love now
No fear
Don't you turn like Orpheus, just stay here
Hold me in the dark and when the day appears
We’ll say
We did not give up on love today

[Part II: Fire]

[Verse 1]
Door clicks while his wheels start spinning on the pavement
I go fill the space up where he has been staying
Won't lose much sleep, he never went that deep
""Love you,"" oh, you sweet thing, no, I never said that
Let me hold your ego while you get your bag packed
Don't take this the wrong way
But when the spade shows up, I call it by its first name

[Chorus]
We were, we were never gonna catch fire
We'd've burned up in the flames
Long before they ever rose up higher
Someday, I, I won't have to feel the cold
But I do now, so I'll know
What it feels like when I feel fire, fire

(Fire)

[Verse 2]
Talk, touch, kiss, then this one's just like all the others
And I know all too well that I want deeper waters
I held my breath to swim
But shallow shores aren’t safe enough to dive in

[Chorus]
We were, we were never gonna catch fire
We’d've burned up in the flames
Long before they ever rose up higher
Someday, I, I won’t have to feel the cold
But I do now, so I'll know
What it feels like when I feel fire, fire

[Bridge]
That comes-and-stays fire
On-blood-and-veins fire
I've only ever wanted fire
In my chest, in my mouth, on my tongue, in my mind
In my soul, so my lungs can breathe in fire

[Chorus]
We'd’ve burned up in the flames
Long before they ever rose up higher
Someday, I, I won't have to feel the cold
I do now, so I'll know
What it feels like when I feel fire, fire
Fire, fire

Holy shit we're at the Hollywood Bowl
Goodnight, goodbye, gotta go
Just kidding, I just got here
I'm so glad you're here
Thank you for coming

[Verse 1]
By the time you hear this, I'll be in the rearview mirror
I'll even wear that green dress you like, so when I disappear
You can turn around, one last look at the girl you lost
In the time you took to make up your mind between two roads
Go and take some more time, but me and mine must go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to wait it out, no more
I can't find the man I was waiting for

[Chorus]
I wanted to be your girl in a white T-shirt
Over coffee, stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
I wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin
Stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
(While you read me poetry by dead men)
While you read me poetry by dead men

By the time you hear this, who knows where I might be?
Singin' 'bout another near-miss love that ended incomplete
I was ready, but you weren't
So jump with your net from this bridge you've burned
I wanted to tell you things, all the secrets I've been keepin'
I saw it in front of me, but then you just kept disappearin'

[Pre-Chorus]
A good dream, almost
Now I tell your ghost

[Chorus]
I wanted to be your girl in a white T-shirt
Over coffee, stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
I wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin
Stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
(While you read me poetry by dead men)
While you read me poetry by dead men

[Bridge]
Line after line, the words just left to remind
The two of us, oh, what we could have been
Poetry by dead men
Fire from embers, how can I make you remember?
With a turn of a phrase, would you turn to me if I say
""I still want to be your girl?""
[Chorus]
I still wanna be your girl in a white T-shirt
Over coffee, stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
I wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin
Stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry
(While you read me poetry by dead men)
While you read me poetry
(I wanted to be your girl)
I wanted to be your girl
(I wanted to be your girl)
I wanted to be your girl
(I wanted to be your girl)
(I wanted to be your girl)

[Outro]
This is what I look like standing up
Thank you!
Alright, goodnight
That's gonna be my thing tonight I reckon, I can already feel it, I'm just gonna keep pretending like I'm leaving
Then it's gonna be like 11:30, and you guys are gonna be like ""is she gonna fucking leave? We would love that, parking is hard""
We're at the Hollywood Bowl
I'm the most nervous about this show, I'm just gonna get it out there
L.A., you motherfuckers, you intimidate me, it's why I had to move
Just kidding, I love coming back, it feels like homeEmbed"

Johnny drives a big rig, Johnny's not sleeping
Sweet Geraldine turned 80 in the spring
But her nerves won't quit, she worries about everything

Jessie's doing backflips, Molly's doing so well
Joey's got a new girl, Emily moved away
And the world's on fire
The whole time we're trying to set out the flame

Can't stop it, won't slow down

But until thеy do, I've got nothing to lose

Gathered at the funeral, everybody looked bored

Oh my God, there's so many familiar faces
Hi
I went to company with you [?]
You what?
I went to company with you [?]
We were on the spring sing together? Company? Well put it there buddy
Hi
It's my birthday
It's your birthday? Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
How old are you? Don't tell me, just kidding, we don't do that, we don't do that, we're women, we don't do anything
You guys good over here?
You're going to be staring at my backside tonight, you're welcome in advance, thank you
Any love birds out here?
Back there? Up here?
Now everybody's just raising their hand for attention, this is so LA, oh my God
Alright, well if you're love birds, or you're single, keep your hands up, find each other
It's a match made

[Verse 1]
Let the bough break, let it come down crashin'
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
I can't say I'd even notice it was absent
'Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
I'll unfold before you
Would have strung together
The very first words of a lifelong love letter

There was a time when I would have believed them
If they told me you could not come true
Just love's illusion
But then you found me and everything changed
And I believe in something again
My whole heart
Will be yours forever
This is a beautiful start
To a lifelong love letter

We'll learn from our mistakes
And as long as it takes
I will prove my love to you
I am not scared of the elements
I am underprepared, but I am willing
And even better
I get to be the other half of you

Tell the world we finally got it all right

What is happening? Is somebody getting engaged? Is that what's going on

You think they're what?
I think there was a proposal guys
I want you all to, no, no, I want only if you got engaged, turn your lights on
Nobody else can switch their lights on
Wait there's three, what the fuck?
Hi, congratulations
You can name your relationship Sara
I think we're all glad I'm here
Congratulations
To be honest, I heard some shit go down in the middle of the song, but I thought I was going to forget the words, so I didn't stop
But I'm glad we took a moment

You sound amazing LA
I wanna introduce you to a wonderful friend of mine
An incredible asset to the band
He's on the heartbeat, this is Mr. Charley Drayton on the drums
Hey buddy
Um, so, as, as you've already experienced, we're gonna
Do some new songs, we're gonna do some old songs, um
This is another song off the new record and
This was written, the seeds of this song were written, um
After I returned home from the women's march and
Did you march LA?
Man, I was um, I was profoundly changed by that experience, um
My actual sister and my chosen sisters, some of my best friends
We made the pilgrimage
Some of them are here tonight that I marched with
Woo, I hear you somewhere
Um, and we made the pilgrimage to Washington D.C
And we crowded in a hotel room
And we marched on the mall with hundreds of thousands of people
And I have never felt safer or more seen and heard in my entire life
It was so powerful to lend your, your time and energy to something
Um, bigger and more important than just you and it was so beautiful and, um
So I, I really started thinking about
The fact that we're alive at this time
Where there's this incredible shift in consciousness about what it means to be a woman
And what it means to sort of
Disassemble and, and reanalyze some things that have always just been sort of
Social constructs and they're just, they just are but they don't have to be
And so to be alive at a time where we get to make these choices consciously is
Super fucking important to me and I am so proud to be a feminist
And I am so proud
That I also love the men in my life and that I'm surrounded by an incredible community of, of
Men and women who lift each other up
So um, this one goes out to
To all my sisters and all our friendsEmbed"

Most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them

It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but shе's kind
She is lonely most of the timе
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine

It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life
Just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person
Who makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you

If I'm honest, I know
I would give it all back for
A chance to start over
Rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

Who'll be reckless, just enough
Who'll get hurt
But who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used
By a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Used to be mine

She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mineEmbed"

I feel you, it's like you're in the next room
At any given moment, you could reappear
Thin air, you're out there in it somewhere
If I could only get there, I could breathe again

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how to start
What comes after you?
I am in the dark
Love, what now?

[Chorus]
No such thing as over you
I don't want it anyway
I wouldn't even try to
If I don't let go then there is
No such thing as over this
Tried to get over you, over you, over you
But I think there's no such thing
Mm-mm

[Verse 2]
Broken, you're Rome, I am the ruins
The stone I can't find you in is all that still remains

Little white lights
They perforate every night sky
I say it to them every time
""Come back in""

[Chorus]
No such thing as over you
I don't want it anyway
I wouldn't even try to
If I don't let go, then there is
No such thing as over this
I tried to get over you, over you, over you

[Bridge]
You're on my mind, all the time
But I can't fix it by fixating on a rewind
(Tried to get over you, over you, over you)
When a good thing changes
When the change is staying
Only way to find is
How to hold on 'til there's something else to hold on to
(Over you, over you, over you)
Hold on, 'til there's something else to hold on to

[Vocal Interlude]
[Chorus from Satellite Call]
This is so you'll know the sound
Of someone who loves you, loves you, loves you
From the ground
Tonight you're not alone at all
This is me sending out my satellite call

[Chorus]
No such thing as over you
I don't want it anyway
I wouldn't even try to
If I don't let go, then there is
No such thing as over this
I've tried to get over you, over you, over you
But I think there's no such thing

[Outro]
Alright, Los Angeles
I know you're seated, I know you're comfortable
But if there was any point in time
If you're like me and you're, um, slowly going into hypothermia
This is a great time to get up out of your seats
And your, your behind neighbor is not allowed to get mad at you
Because we have to move around if we're gonna stay alive, right?

But I know that I'm stuck
In the middle of moving too little
Just standing here

Then how will I know?
I don't know anything

But on your mark, set, ready, watch me

Closed my eyes to see

To write is just to bleed

Until I change the truth, rearrange the letters
For beauty underneath

I could really use you now

Tell her we fight until the neighbors knock
That I am predisposed to wander off in thought
Tell her I fall asleep when we watch TV
And it drives you crazy having to rewind the scenes
But you do for me

[Verse 2]
Tell her my temper has a strong grip
I'm stubborn as a bloodstain, and we both know it
Tell her we laugh a lot, and I've seen you cry
And it isn't lost on me she's the reason why
Tell her all about it

[Chorus]
Tell her I don't want to take her place
While you're at it, tell yourself thе same thing
I know she's still your friend, and that won't еnd
But I just need to hear I'm the one again
So, if you don't want to see me leave, could you please–

[Verse 3]
Tell me it's complicated, being loved
But don't tell me I'm not trying hard enough
It feels like jealousy, but underneath
Is a scared little girl who's a lot like me
So, if you don't want to see me leave

It's everything I am and what I'm not
And all I'm tryna be
This is the part where I spit it all out
And you decide what you think of me
I'm not trying to be complicated
I'm never waiting to get the last laugh
But I've been handing out benefits of the doubt
And I'd like a little bit back

[Chorus]
It's just a little voice
And if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest things
It's just my little voice that I've been missing

[Verse 2]
Looking over the precious moments, it hurts, don't it?
They can cut both ways
No amount of remembering thе better things will make thе bad ones go away
But I've been broken and the one to blame
So my savior of self-defense, taught me to sing what I can't say

[Chorus]
It's just a little voice
And if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest things
It's just my little voice that I've been missing

And I just don't know how I would ever say it any other way

I still love you

And I rock back and forth

To add to the millions of other
Songs to lost lovers?
Will mine lift up a spirit at all?

2‚ 2‚ 3

When I was a boy
Hardly more than ten years old
My family moved to a small town
And I was destroyed leaving all my friends behind
And if I'd had a choice, we'd've stayed put
It's only now I can see
Sometimes a little change can be good

At the end of the block
The ramshackle diner stood
My after school stop just to pass time
Where I met a girl nearly three times my age
But still, she painted my world with her kind words
And soft curves
Just a schoolboy crush
But you remind me of her

She saw something in me
I was lonely and misunderstood
She'd ask me to write down my wildest schemes
And over slices of blueberry pie
I learned to dream
See Sara Bareilles LiveGet tickets as low as $58You might also likeShe'd say ""What good's a dreamer without a believer?
We all just need someone to care
One who might listen and root for our wishes
Someone to simply be glad that we're there

When everything else falls away
If no one believes her‚ what good's a dreamer anyway?

Thank god for that place
It practically saved me
Those school kids sure didn't take kind to this stranger
And I was eccentric, all grand plans and inventions
That I would've just thrown away
By listening, she let me have something to say

What good's a dreamer without a believer?
We all just need someone to care

Prepare for the new little infant

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies

She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine

It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over and rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

Miss Simone
Singing, ""Pour some sugar in my bowl, baby""
In the glow of the candlelight, we can dance all night
On the rooftop, thinking no one needs to know a thing
But Miss Simone
No one but Miss Simone

[Bridge]
How'd she know what a heart sounds like
In the glow of this candle on a rooftop in the moonlight?

[Pre-Chorus]
Someday when we're old and gray
Sifting through our yesterdays
We'll pull that memory from its sleeve
And play that song of you and me

[Chorus]
And Miss Simone
Singing, ""Pour some sugar in my bowl, baby""
In the glow of the candlelight, we will dance all night
On the rooftop, thinking no one needs to know a thing
But Miss Simone
No one but Miss Simone

Poured my glass of wine
You caught me some fireflies
Told me their names
And how much they love their life in a jar
You twist around me like vines
You rub the stars in my bright eyes
Then you sold me a future
From the ones you had in the trunk of your car

[Pre-Chorus]
You said I think too much
You said I always mess it up
It was so easy to believe
I've always said the same things

[Chorus]
Stay out, honey, I can see you're wicked
And I don't want your wicked love
Don't need what makes me feel addicted
I don't want your wicked love
Stay out, stay out
I don't want your wicked love
Stay out, stay out

You thought I didn't notice
You had me caught like a firefly
I'd abandoned my flight
To be crawling around with these wings
But I won't forget this moment (Wait until you see)
And how mighty the truth can be
How her hammer and nails
Chisel beauty from grotesque things

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I think too much
Tell me I always mess it up
Well, I'll break the glass and see
If the fireflies agree

Come by the fire, lay down your head
My love, I see you're growing tired
So set the bad day by the bed
And rest a while, your eyes can close
You don’t have to do a thing but listen to me sing
I know you miss the world, the one you knew
The one where everything made sense
Because you didn't know the truth, that's how it works
’Til the bottom drops out and we learn
We're all just hunters seeking solid ground

[Chorus]
Don't stop trying to find me here amidst the chaos
Though I know it's blinding there's a way out
Say out loud, we will not give up on love now
No fear, don't you turn like Orpheus, just stay here
Hold me in the dark and when the day appears
We'll say we did not give up on love today

[Verse 2]
I'll show you good, restore your faith
I’ll try and somehow make a meaning of the poison in this place
Convince you, love, don’t breathe it in
You were written in the stars that we are swimming in
And it has no name, no guarantee
It's just the promise of a day I know that some may never see
But that’s enough, if the bottom drops out
I hope my love was someone else's solid ground

Ooh

[Verse 1]
By the time you hear this, I'll be in the rearview mirror
I'll even wear that green dress you like, so when I disappear
You can turn around, one last look at the girl you lost
In the time you took to make up your mind between two roads
Go and take some more time, but me and mine must go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to wait it out, no more
I can't find the man I was waiting for

[Chorus]
I wanted to be your girl in a white T-shirt
Over coffee, stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
I wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin
Stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
(While you read me poetry by dead men)
While you read me poetry by dead men

[Verse 2]
By the time you hear this, who knows where I might be?
Singin' 'bout another near-miss love that ended incomplete
I was ready, but you weren't
So jump with your net from this bridge you've burned
I wanted to tell you things, all the secrets I've been keepin'
I saw it in front of me, but then you just kept disappearin'

I still want to be your girl?

So, tell the saint of lost souls where to find me
Softly sleepin', here in the deep end

'Cause you know that sometimes I can't stop
And still, I'm seeking out
To stand up when the bottom drops
The weight of all the world
Can blind me to its beauty

It's for you, little lady
Is it all that you dreamed of?
Oh, if I knew what had been there waiting
I'd have screamed out and jumped up

Now here I am
With my feet on the sand
And a body that won't move
The tide's coming in
And I'm bound for a swim
In a pair of cement shoes

He takes what he can, what he wants
Doesn't matter if it's ever been given
I took the bait and a chance on a man
Sold by the boy that he lived in

And I was wrong to believe that strength makes you strong
And I had hope in a change I would see in us both
And now I'm heavy
He lifts me, but never once carried
Door number two, I've already walked through

Ask me the question:
Who coulda guessed I would be here at this crossroad?
Plain to be seen that it's all up to me
I'm no longer alone, though
See Sara Bareilles LiveGet tickets as low as $58You might also likeAnd nothing's changed
And I see it more every day
Nothing moves
It's a game to be played and to lose

And now I'm heavy, unsteady
But maybe I'm getting ready
And this might catch fire and char this ground

I might lift this up to only be the one
Who's gonna get let down
Will I be enough to get this on its way
To find some higher ground?
Before the waters rush, I've got to make a change
Or else I know I'll drown

Baby, look around
Door number two, I've already walked through
I wanna see what's behind door number threeEmbed"

I stick with real things
Usually facts and figures
When information's in its place I minimize the guessing game
Guess what?
I don't like guessing games or when I feel things
Before I know the feelings
How am I supposed to operate if I'm just tossed around by fate?
Like on an unexpected date

[Verse 2]
With a stranger who might talk too fast
Or ask me questions about myself before I've decided that
He can ask me questions about myself
He might sit too close
Or call the waiter by his first name
Or eat Oreos
But eat the cookie before the cream
But what scares me the most...
What scares me the most...

[Chorus 1]
Is what if when he sees me
What if he doesn't like it?
What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it
What happens then if
When he knows me
He's only disappointed?
What if I give myself away to only get it given back?
I couldn't live with that
So I'm just fine inside my shell-shaped mind
This way I get the best view
So when he sees me, I want him to

I'm not defensive
I'm simply being cautious
I can't risk reckless dating
Due to my miscalculating why
A certain suitor stands in line I've seen in movies
Most made for television
You cannot be too careful when it comes to sharing your life
I could end up a miserable wife

[Verse 4]
He could be criminal
Some sort of psychopath who escaped from an institution somewhere where they don't have girls
He could have masterminded some way to find me
He could be color blind
How untrustworthy is that? He could be less than kind
Or even worse, he could be very nice, have lovely eyes
And make me laugh
Come out of hiding
What do I do with that?
Oh god

[Chorus 2]
What if when he sees me
I like him and he knows it
What if he opens up a door and I can't close it?
What happens then?
If when he holds me
My heart is set in motion
I'm not prepared for that I'm scared of breaking open
But still I can't help from hoping
To find someone to talk to
Who likes the way I am
Someone who when he sees me, wants to again1Embed"

Sugar, butter, flour

Sometimes I still see her
My mother, the dreamer
She'd say, ""Nothing's impossible, child""

A dream needs believing
To taste like the real thing
Like some stranger you recognize

So pure, so electric
So sure, so connected
To those little believers inside
May we all be so lucky

But dreams are elusive
The kind we've gotten used to is
Nothing I can feel
Nothing I can hold
Nothing I can have
Nothing that I know
Dreams come and they go

But hold them and keep them
(But hold them and keep them)
And know that you need them
(And know that you need them)
When your breaking point's all that you have
A dream is a soft place to land
May we all be so lucky

Such a stubborn man, you'll likely never meet another

She's the best
You'll learn all about her on our family history test

Show you I'm not moving
Wherever you go, I won't be far to follow

You can try, oh, but I
""I love you"" means you're never ever ever getting rid of me

[Verse 2]
I grew up an only child in a suburb of the city
Spent my days alone; my only friend was a stray kitty called Sardine
I thought it was hilarious to call a cat a kind of fish
She played hard to get, hissing while she scratched me
What she was trying to say was ""Ogie, come and catch me""
I learned quickly
That perseverance stood between a cat and her new best friend: me!

Have taken more than I gave them

Just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person
Who makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you

If I'm honest, I know
I would give it all back for
A chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

Who'll be reckless, just enough
Who'll get hurt
But who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used
By a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Used to be mine

We met on a rainy evening in the summertime
Don't think I need to tell you more
I needed a raise I worked so hard for this love of mine
Love of mine
Still I got nothing to show for it

Here's a simplification of everything we're going through:
You plus me is bad news
But you're a lovely creation, and I like to think that I am too
My friend said I look better without you

Tongue tied and twisted
Go on, baby, and go to my head

Babe, baby believe me
If I stay, it ain't gonna be easy

No words, my tears won't make any room for more
And it don't hurt like anything I've ever felt before
This is no broken heart, no familiar scars
This territory goes uncharted
Just me, in a room sunk down in a house in a town
And I don't breathe, no I never meant to let it get away from me
Now I've too much to hold
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
And I want uncharted
I'm stuck under the ceiling I made
I can't help but feeling

I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go

So don't ask me how to get started
It's all uncharted

Waiting for the road to be laid
Though I may be going down

Give me a heart to hold the godlike truth

Give me good reason to believe in you
And give me strength if you have time

Give me two hands that’ll hold us up
And though you give me no more than just enough
You gave a pair of brown eyes that could call a good bluff
To somebody who thinks they shine

Spend most of my life on a microphone
Giving all that I got til I head back home
And when the lights go out, and I’m all alone
I’ve got no reason to be crying
And on a bad day I feel like a masochist
Take it away from me if it’s for the best

One too many drinks tonight and I miss you
Like you were mine
All your stormy words have barely broken
And you sound like thunder
Though you've barely spoken
Oh it looks like rain tonight
But a clear sky, just wouldn't feel right

But I keep believing
I'm staying believing
He's gonna come 'round soon

You may be my final match
'Cause I chase everything when you play throw and I play catch
Never took much to keep me satisfied
But the bullshit you feed me
You miss me, you need me
This hungry heart will not subside

But I keep believing
I'm staying believing
He's gonna come 'round soon

I may seem naive if I cry as you leave
Like I'm just one more tortured heart
These cracks that I show as I'm watching you go aren't tearing me apart
I may seem naive if I cry as you leave

The angels said I'd smile today
But who needs angels anyway
Not me, not me, not me-

He's gonna come 'round-

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues
Ooh, aah

[Chorus]
So goodbye, yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

[Verse 2]
So, what do you think you'll do then?
I bet they shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To get you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

It's a really old city
Stuck between the dead and the living
So I thought to myself, sitting on a graveyard shelf
As the echo of heartbeats, from the ground below my feet
Filled a cemetery in the center of Queens
I started running the maze of
The names and the dates, some older than others
The skyscrapers, little tombstone brothers
With Manhattan behind her, three million stunning reminders
Built a cemetery in the center of Queens

[Chorus]
You said, remember that life is
Not meant to be wasted
We can always be chasing the sun
So fill up your lungs and just run
But always be chasing the sun

[Verse 2]
So how do you do it
With just words and just music, capture the feeling
That my earth is somebody's ceiling
Can I deliver in sound, the weight of the ground
Of a cemetery in the center of Queens
There's a history through her
Sent to us as a gift from the future, to show us the proof
More than that, it's to dare us to move
And to open our eyes and to learn from the sky
From a cemetery in the center of Queens

I've turned to petrified past life baggage
I want to disappear and just start over
So here we are

From on my knees, make me a Hercules

I wish I'd thought ahead and left a few crumbs
I'm on the hunt for who I've not yet become
But I'd settle for a little equilibrium

Both sides dissatisfied and somewhat violent
The issue I have now begun to see
I am the only, lonely casualty

[Verse 1]
This one’s for the lonely child
Broken-hearted, running wild
This was written for the ones to blame
One who believes they are the cause of chaos in everything

[Verse 2]
You may find yourself in the dead of night
Lost somewhere out there in the great big beautiful sky
You were all just perfect little satellites
Spinning 'round and 'round this broken earthly life

[Hook]
This is so you’ll know the sound
Of someone who loves you
From the ground
Tonight you're not alone at all
This is me sending out my satellite call

[Interlude]

[Hook]
This is so you’ll know the sound
Of someone who loves you
From the ground
Tonight you're not alone at all
This is me sending out my satellite call

Okay, I can see it now it's all the same thing
Just different wrapping around it
No need to soften your words, they're still gonna hurt
So don't pull punches
I tried to be everything you'd ever want
And sometimes I even stood on my heart and stomped
Now I'm finally alone and dressed for the show
But going nowhere
They don't need to see me crying

[Chorus]
I'll get my little black dress on
And if I put on my favorite song
I'm gonna dance until you're all gone
I'll get my little black dress on

[Verse 2]
You came, lifted me up but then you dropped a hurricane
Now I'm fighting to find the ground again, to steady my feet
Get up off my knees and just remember
That I am more than just somebody's puppet
I can find the cord and then I'll cut it
I stand a pretty good chance to dust myself off and dance

[Chorus 2]
I'll get my little black dress on
And if I put on my favorite song
I'm gonna dance until you're all gone
I'll get my little black dress on
I got my little black dress on
And if I tell myself that nothing's wrong
This doesn't have to be a sad song
Not with my little black dress on

Come in close, now it's time to tell the story:
Long ago, and so many years before we
Ever were, ever dreamed we even could be
There was her and her very first heartbeat
All alone in a corner of the night sky
Spiral bones of a supernova starlight
Fell in love with another burning bright
She dreamed of a way to ignite
She said

[Chorus]
""Tonight
Come on, come on, collide
Break me to pieces, I
I think you're just like heaven
Why
Come on, come on, collide
Let's see what a fire feels like
I bet it's just like heaven""
(Just like heaven)
(Just like heaven)

[Verse 2]
Such a shame, nowhere near even a near miss
Light years away from the hope of being sun-kissed
Anchored home in her interstellar sea
But poor lonely Cassiopeia
So she sighs, and she burns with desperation
Learns to cry over love of constellations
Then: a spark from a star shooting too close
They both smiled; what a day to explode!

Looking at you
Counting the steps
Between us

Little blades in a line
From your skin to mine
And I feel it
Eyes on the ground
But I can't look up now
Don't wanna give it away
My secret

In another life
My teeth and tongue
Would speak aloud what until now
I've only sung

'Cause I would die to make you mine
You bleed me dry each and every time

Than the risk of losing what I don't have now
I'm weaker by the minute, though
Is it so bad if I wanna cry out–

You wanna walk into the room like that other girl does
The one that’s always making everybody fall in love
You see - girl you’re a lot like me
She rearranges all the light in the room so you’re always in the shadows
Well that’s what it feels like to you…
Baby, I’ve been there too
And I know how much it can sometimes hurt
You feel like the whole world has made you the ugly girl
But take it from me that you have to see it first

[Chorus]
So before you trade in your summer skin for those high heeled shoes
To make him want to be with you
Let me remind you one more time
That just maybe, you’re beautiful but you just can't see
So why don’t you trust me
They’ll see it too, you beautiful girl, you

[Verse 2]
You wanna lay the blame on somebody else
All these tiny little minds that leave you up on a shelf
Well, okay, I’ve seen it done that way
But just in case nobody ever comes through
Riding in to come to your rescue
You've still a chance
You don’t have to be asked to dance
And I know how much you’ve been dying to say
""Look how much everybody loves me""
But guess who gets left when everyone else fades away

Like I'm kneeling
Prostrate to what fate sent through
Holding down the only solid ground I can find
'Cause I don't wanna try the other kind
I don't have it yet, a good sense of
Knowing when what I do should be immediate
But all this waiting for a sign from the other side
For fuck's sake, this is just a timeline

Pick at your paralysis
And unlock it
And flex the fear 'til it builds you a rocket and rise
And if you fall at least you end up between
Where you will be and where you will have been

If I build it out of blood and bone
If I love it and I even give it a good name
And I let it stand up on it's own
And if I even ever learn to trust and walk away
Will it crumble on it's own two feet?
Or will it multiply and grow big, white wings?
If I love it and I give it life
Can I let it go and know that it was never mine?

To rise up, you gotta learn to root down

And I send it to my very closest of friends
And they somehow bring it back to life
What if I only ever do it all over again?

On a sea of unnamed and untamed passages

Somebody's hands who felt like mine
Turned the key and took a drive
Was free
Highway curve, the sun sank low
Buckley on the radio
Cigarette was burning slow
So breathe

Just yellow lines and tire marks
And sun-kissed skin and handle bars
And where I stood was where I was to be
No enemies to call my own
No porch light on to pull me home
And where I was is beautiful
Because I was free

[Verse 2]
Once upon another time
Before I knew which life was mine
Before I left the child behind me
I saw myself in summer nights
And stars lit up like candle light
I make my wish but mostly I believed

Sometimes I can be perfectly sweet
Got this sugary me all stuffed up in my sleeve
And I talk of ponies and rainbows and things
And I'm just who you want me to be
But like most creatures down here on the ground
I'm composed of the elements moving around
And I grow and change and I shift and I switch
And it turns out I'm actually kind of a bitch
But that only happens when I get provoked
By some piece of shit asshole we
All sadly know
And I sit and I write while reminding you all
That mean songs are still better than going postal

This territory goes uncharted
Just me, in a room sunk down in a house in a town, and I
Don't breathe, though I never meant to let it get away from me
Now I have too much to hold
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
And I want uncharted

[Pre-Chorus]
Stuck under the ceiling I made
I can't help the feeling

[Chorus]
I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started, it's all uncharted

Each day
I'm counting up the minutes, 'til I get alone, 'cause I can't stay
In the middle of it all, it's nobody's fault, but I'm so low
Never knew how much I didn't know
Oh, everything is uncharted

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm getting nowhere, when I only sit and stare like

[Chorus]
I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started, it's all uncharted

[Bridge]
Jumpstart my kaleidoscope heart
I love to watch the colors fade
They may not make sense, but they sure as hell made me
I won't go as a passenger, no
Waiting for the road to be laid
Though I may be going down
I'll take in flame over burning out
Compare where you are to where you want to be
And you'll get nowhere
[Chorus]
I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started

Goodbye
Should be saying that to you by now, shouldn't I?
Laying down a law that I live by
Well, maybe next time

[Verse 1]
I've got a thick tongue
Brimming with the words that go unsung
I simmer, then I burn for a someone, the wrong one
And I tell myself to let the story end, oh
That my heart will rest in someone else's hand
But my 'why not me?' philosophy began
And I say

[Chorus]
Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday
Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's a vicious little word that can slay me
Keep me where I'm hurting, you make me
Hang from your hands
But no more
I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door
If I'm aching at the thought of you, what for?
That's not me anymore
And I'm not the girl that I intend to be
But I dare you, darlin', just you wait and see
But this time, not for you, but just for me

It comes calling in the evening
When the temperature is dropping out
They said it don't get cold here
But I beg to differ now

[Verse 1]
There is something in the shadows
More than sister silhouette
Something sinister and strange
That I haven't seen yet

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want to be alone
Sky, don't let the sun go
I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

[Chorus]
And I don't want to cry when you go
Stay a little longer, you know
You're making me feel
I'm not alone

[Verse 2]
You don't have to fight the bad guys
Throwing punches out into the black
If you have to tell me lies, I don't care
Just give me some good back

Stay a little longer, you know
You're making me feel

[Verse 3]
And if I only worry about it
Worry about it, worry about it
I just keep breaking down
Breaking down, breaking down
Boy, I could do without
Do without, do without
A night of the bad dreams, sad things
Tell me what that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want to be alone
Sky, don't let the sun go
I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

Car is parked, bags are packed
But what kind of heart doesn't look back
At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours?
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns

[Chorus]
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again

[Verse 2]
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore

[Chorus]
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again

Word came through in a letter
One of us changing our minds
You won't need to guess who
Since I usually do not send letters to me
That are mine
I told him I saw this coming
That I'd practically packed up my things
I was glad at the time that I said I was fine
But all honesty knows, I wasn't ready, no

And so here we go bluebird
Back to the sky on your own
Oh, let him go bluebird
Ready to fly
You and I
Here we go

From too many years by my side
They can carry me, swear to be

And I'm so tired

Brimming with the words that go unsung
I simmer, then I burn for a someone, the wrong one
And I tell myself to let the story end
My heart will rest in someone else's hand
My 'why not me?' philosophy began
And I say

[Chorus]
Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
Someday
Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
Someday

Maybe it's a vicious little word that can slay me
Keep me when I'm hurting, you make me
Hang from your hands
Well, no more
I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door
If I'm aching at the thought of you, what for?
It's not me anymore
And I'm not the girl that I intend to be

As the gold fluttered down from the sky

She's got a crush on the guy at the liquor store
'Cause Mr. Charming don't come home anymore and

She says ""None for you dear prince, I'm tired today""
I'd rather sleep my whole life away
Than have you keep me from dreaming

'Cause I don't care for your fairytales
You're so worried 'bout the maiden though
You know she's only waiting on the next best thing (next best thing)

Snow White is doing dishes again 'cause
What else could you do with seven itty-bitty men?
Sends them to bed and she calls up a friend
Says ""Would you meet me at midnight?""
The tall blonde lets out a cry of despair says
""Would have cut it myself if I knew men could climb hair""
I'll have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows

'Cause I don't care for your fairytales
You're so worried 'bout the maiden though
You know she's only waiting on the next best thing (next best thing)

Once upon a time in a faraway kingdom
Man made up a story said that I should believe him
Go and tell your white knight that he's handsome in hindsight
But I don't want the next best thing
So I sing, I hold my head down and I break these walls 'round me

And sit and watch the waves with me 'til they're gone

I pray is not wasted

I could use another cigarette
But don't worry daddy, I'm not addicted yet
One too many drinks tonight and I miss you
Like you were mine
All your stormy words have barely broken
And you sound like thunder though
You've barely spoken
Oh, it looks like rain tonight and thank God
Because a clear sky just wouldn't feel right

[Chorus]
He's taken and leaving
But I keep believing
That he's gonna come round soon
(He'll come round soon I know)

[Verse 2]
You may be my final match
Because I chase everything when you play
Throw and I play catch
It never took much to keep me satisfied
But all the bullshit you feed me you miss me
You need me
This hungry heart will not subside

Well I may seem naive if I cry as you leave
Like I'm just one more tortured heart
These cracks that I show as I'm watching
You go aren't tearing me apart

Well who needs angels anyway?

No right minds could wrong be
This many times

My memory is cruel
I'm queen of attention to details
Defending intentions if he fails
Until now: he told me her name
It sounded familiar in a way
And I could have sworn I'd heard him say it
Ten thousand times
Oh, If only I had been listening

So I've learned to listen through silence

Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

[Pre-Chorus]
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
(Yeah) Today, yeah

[Verse 2]
I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were

Throw and I play catch
Never took much to keep me satisfied
But all this bullshit you feed me, you miss me
You need me
This hungry heart will not subside

[Chorus]
He's taken and leaving
But I keep believing
That he's gonna come round soon
Until I see him again
I'm staying believing
That it won't be deceiving
When he's gonna come round soon

[Verse 3]
I may seem naive if I cry as you leave
Like I'm just one more tortured heart
But baby, don't be fooled
Cause these cracks that I show as I'm watching
You go aren't tearing me apart
Cause I know I'll see you soon
The angels said I'd smile today
Oh, well who needs angels anyway?
Hey-ey, yeah
[Chorus]
He's taken and leaving
I keep believing
That he's gonna come round soon
(He's gonna come round home)
Til I see him again
I'm staying believing
That it won't be deceiving
When he's going come round soon
He's taken and leaving
I keep believing
He's gonna come round soon
Til I see him again
I'm staying believing
That it won't be deceiving
That he's gonna come round soon

[Outro]
He's taken and leaving
But I keep believing
That he's going to come round soon
Till is ee gim again
I'm staying believing
That it won't be deceiving
When he's gonna come round sounds
He's gonna come around soon
He's gonna come around soon
Soon, soon

I've been winding
Down the same road for days
I've seen the coastline
Going both ways
Some days are perfect
And some simply could not get worse
Some days it's all worth it
And some days this life is nothing but a curse
And I wonder who will break first

[Chorus]
I am small
I feel like no more than nothing at all
But when I lose sight of daylight
And my darkness falls
I'll be strong
And if not now it won't be long
From when I lose sight of daylight
And my hands are weak
And my soul is tired
Oh, I'll give my love from the inside out
From the inside out

[Verse 2]
Little spirit
Now don't you desert me now
I know I don't always hear it
You don't always speak so loud
And I'm not willing
To simply lay down my soul for this
It may be all that I'm giving
But take my love for what it is

There's a harvest each Saturday night
At the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride
A place you can stand for one night and get gone
And It's clear this conversation ain't doing a thing
'Cause these boys only listen to me when I sing
And I don't feel like singing tonight
All the same songs

[Chorus]
Here in these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
There's nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?

The situation's always the same
You got your wolves in thеir clothes whispering Hollywood's name
Stеaling gold from the silver they see
But it's not me

Because I think I did too

I did a few things right
But it will take what it will take

But if you live deep and love strong
You get pretty damn close

But his arms are angels by his side

Ooh, and with our love we conjure up twilight
His fingers are music to my soul
And I feel his song play everywhere I go

You claim your innocence
And I blame your reticence
For why, I never knew no, never knew how you play

You leave your love with your mark on your unfortunate prey
But there is no excuse
I don't like being used
Someday it's gonna get back to you, oh

You're so predictable man
You hit the ground and you ran
Ran as if I, if I would chase you
But your dear delectable prize
Beneath your near electrical skies
Is damn near disappointment at most
I didn't know I paid for merely a masquerade
So I want my money back, hey

He bends his breath around my name
And I am humbled, I feel small and plain
But his arms are angels by his side
You need not ask if they're open, just how wide

[Verse 2]
His lips are day and his skin is night
Ooh, and with our love we conjure up twilight
His fingers are music to my soul
And I feel his song play everywhere I go

[Chorus]
My love, my love is on his way
I can't wait to see the day
I thankfully lay me down
Oh, my love, my love is on his way
I'm waiting patiently
But if you see me now
My love, please hurry

[Verse 3]
He loves with rhythm and paints with flame
He comes in pieces with no name
I won't need answers, I'll just know
Because I've read the sonnets about his soul

He can be ordinary in the best ways
And still dance like a poet
Through every word he says

I can't wait to see the day

Oh, my love, my love is on his way
I'm waiting patiently
But if you see me now

Can you see me now

He makes me crazy
He makes me cruel
Oh, but I pray he makes me anything
But a fool

Little girl, little town, little left to say
Hard enough to get out, much less get away
Speak your mind if you dare to be heard
I warn you, I’m very daring with words

I was wild and untamed, on the hunt for myself
Got your claws in my mane, as if I need help
Made my mask, made my dress
Did your best to make me
You came first, now at last
Hear what I heard you say

Stay in one place
Don’t you mess around, and wear a little blush on your face
Be a good girl, good girls are what we need
Wear it if you can, take it like a man
Remember your place

And I don't feel like singing tonight

But never a waste of my time

And, for love’s sake, you let love end

And a silence entered the room
For one last ""I’m gonna love you""

You may be my final match
Because I chase everything when you play
Throw and I play catch
Never took much to keep me satisfied
But all this bullshit you feed me, you miss me
You need me

Like I'm just one more tortured heart
But baby, don't be fooled

I know we're headed for the open road
Don't know where to go
We've got our separate ways in the same direction
Getting nowhere slow

[Verse 2]
We saw the end was coming, the credits rolling in
A few hundred miles back
Oh, but our horizon tends to be deceiving
You never quite know where it's at

[Chorus]
Baby, can we just pretend
We're not telling lies, and this ain't ending?
No talk, no time, no goodbyes
Nothing left of expectations
Just you and me, impulsive creations
With an alibi

If a moment is precious for its brevity
This one's good as gold
It's a compromise of little white lies
The truth remains untold

From time to time, I talk to you
As if you could hear me speak
The breath of me, but words of you
You take the one away, and the other still makes me weak

[Verse 2]
Every now and then, I start to laugh
Thinking of the last time you kissed me free
Still reeling from the aftermath
Of the savory storm of you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a simple world, I know the way it works
And I know I'm not the first

[Chorus]
From time to time, I turn to you
But I won't let it show like you want me to, no
My head held so high, I can hardly see
Wouldn't notice if you were turned to me
If you were turned to me

I hope you can understand
Because we've all been there some
And when you're hanging from someone else's hand
The moment of letting go can leave your fingertips numb

If you were turned to me, I wouldn't think twice
To turn the tacit hands of time back to when you were mine

There's a harvest each Saturday night
At the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride
A place you can stand for one night and get gone
It's clear this conversation ain't doing a thing
Because these boys only listen to me when I sing
And I don't feel like singing tonight
All the same songs

[Chorus]
Here in these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
Nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?

The situation's always the same
You got your wolves in their clothes whispering Hollywood's name
Stealing gold from the silver they see
But it's not me

Sit down with canvas and take me instead
Would you consider me for thoughts unsaid?

There you are
Your idle create temptation's art
And if i justified it, would you start
Unfolding all the pleasures of the dark?

And take your time
Savor moments when the walls are blind
Act like you made me

And, it always seemed, outside your door
The heaviness subsides so I can breathe
