I been trying new things
Mama said she tired of my mood swings

[Verse]
Before I leave the house, I grab a few things
Check the scoreboard, ho, you're losing
I used to cry for meals
The devil offered a deal
Bitch, I just signed for a mil'
You think I won't but I will
I stand tall, Shaquille
Louis Vuitton on my heels
Award shows, I'm in heels
We on tour, Lauryn Hill
I be in the latest, just vibin' to the oldies
Flow so dope, fans fuck around and OD
Might look familiar, but I promise you don't know me
Keep my guard up so you never get to know me
(I cannot trust a soul)
So I stay lonely
(That's just the way it go)
Oh yeah, you know me
(Sometimes your friеnds are foes)
And some familiar
(Ask God and Hе'll expose)
Don't let it kill ya

Can't swim so I'm goin' drown
Didn't know, but I know now

Anxiety all day, fixated on a heartbreak
Yeah, know I'm blessed, but I'm dеpressed
Can't sleep though I need rest
Listеn close when I speak less
My wounds are still open
Lost control of my emotions
Devil keep on provokin'
My joy has been stolen

We argue today but, we gon' talk tomorrow
They say they don't like you, they know who you are though
Bankin' on our downfall, take me to Wells Fargo
You my favorite album, call you Precious Cargo
When nobody's there, you're there for me
When nobody cared, you cared for me
They say you're a conspiracy
Maybe they're right (Well, maybe they're right)

[Verse 1]
How can I be lonely when I'm hangin' with my homie?
His name is Tony, and he's wearin' blue Saucony's
He's standin' right next to me, eatin' ravioli
He's my only friend because the rest of y'all are phony
My last best friend, said he wish he didn't know me
His name was Oscar and he really hurt my feelings
When I grow up I want to hang from a ceilin'
The roof is leakin', the roof is leakin' teardrops
Always available, the perfect companion
Very understandin' and swore to never abandon
He fills the gap in my teeth, when I'm sour, he sweet
The better half of me, no one else can compete (With my guy)

I mean, I've heard a couple songs
Like, they're pretty, I don't know
Take it, leave it, trash it
Um, I'm just not like a fan, more like air conditioner
Yeah

[Chorus]
Whatever I do, you gon' do it just like it
Why would you come if you weren't invited?
Lookin' for a shoe like mine, can't find it
Style so rare, it's hard to describe it

[Verse 1]
They cannot replace me with no other
They say, ""Where you get it?"" from my mother
Big stepper but I'm wеarin' runners
Ask them wherе the bread, I'm just like butter
I'ma mix the Nike with Adidas
Oh my God, I'm sick, I got a fever
I heard they been sleep, it's anaesthesia
I got like two pair of every sneaker
I just took a loss from the flood
I just spent two thousand on a rug
Once I took a nap in the club
I'm so out my mind, they think it's drugs

You was on a jet, ain't leave the ground
It take way more muscle just to frown
Y'all be way too hype to settle down

Why you gotta be so complicated?
You was poppin' and now you faded
I swear, we can never be related
I can ghostwrite for you (Yeah)

Roll the window down slowly (Yeah)
Let 'em know that he owe me (Yes)
They call me the one and only (One)
Hard times just mold me
Comme des Garçons cozy
North Philly with a hoagie
Treat the fans like homies
Give a tip, Ton Mozeby
Keep it clean like soapy
Turtleneck tried to choke me
Too sharp, can't poke me
I'm with Zack like Cody
Feet whitе like Jody
Teeth white like Joiе

I been ballin' on my lonely
Horse power, that's a pony
Do it big, Mick Foley

Won't even play on the playground
So if you don't know me, don't play 'round
To me, you're like edges, so lay down
I made a move on the greyhound
Back when Symere was with Steaktown
I gained some weight, it's like eight pounds
Big Whack, I'm gettin' that cake now
Big Whack, I like when my cake pound
Roadside assistance for breakdown
I can die on any day now
You can die on any day now
We can die on any day now
Don't take it for granted
My bucket hat slanted
I like when you panic
I'm not so romantic
My food is organic
I move just like Michael
I'm lookin' like Janet
You know I'm god damnit

Dead beat daddy, throw em in an urn
Snotty nose kids, avoidin' all the germs
Everybody dies, you live and you die

Yo
So I'm sitting in the studio
It's been a minute
Erm, it's March 13th
And your birthday's next month
So, you know I had to do something special for you
Yeah
Queen

[Chorus]
Grandma died, I was cutting up onions
I ain't wanna talk about nothing
I ain't wanna think about nothing
Can you hear me crying?
I said can you hear me crying for you? Yeah
Grandma died, I was cutting up onions
I ain't wanna talk about nothing
I ain't wanna think about nothing
Can you hear me crying?
I said can you hear me crying for you? Yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't been the same since you left
I hope God plan to take me next
You the reason why I been depressed
Every birthday I'm a wreck
Therapy to get it off my chest
I'm so hurt, I'm tryna do my best
I can never seem to handle death
Hours spent whеre you last slept
Had ya last outfit preppеd
Weezy lied, she ain't even check
Honestly I'm still upset
Nefertiti chain just to rep
Pop pop died, you was never good
Woulda left with him if you could
I was selfish, I misunderstood
I was dumb, I shoulda understood

Hey

Face to face

Sorry, if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone (Sorry)

Tell me when you plan on coming home (Sorry)
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long

[Verse 1]
Sorry, if I made you feel weak
Honestly, I had a bad week
Three feet, it wasn't that deep

Kiss mе on the cheek but not neat

I've never been to jail
Tell a nigga that I'm in here like gel
I just want the paper, can I read the mail?
Tell them it's a fee without the male
Do tell, do tell
Yeah, you dig it like a ditch
If I paid you some attention, you would probably be rich
Sucks to be you, ol' gold digging bitch
Shit, I'm running this shit like Drake with the Six
Let's go let's get it, I'm committed
It's survival of the fittest and I'll only take a minute
Life is short, I compare it to a midget
Shovel in the trunk of the '06 Civic
I'm with it, I'm with it
Therе's no way out
You're stuck in the mud, snow, rain, drought
Like tits no bra, you should go hang out
Body likе a shotgun, just don't bang out (Woo-woo)

You had rap dreams too, why you ain't write in that cell?
We had the same opportunity, I just chose to prevail
You lost ya homie in '06, rest in peace to Darnell
No disrespect, it's 2020, can't continue to dwell
I was under your spell, had me sendin' Venmo and Zelle
While you out here sneakin' bitches in the nicest hotels
Even when you cheated, I felt defeated but didn't seem it

Forgot me, what about me?
Used to be like P.B. (Help me, please)

Used to arch my back for you and now I'm your arch-nemesis
All men should be feminist, Donald Trump fucks immigrants

I was lost, ’til I found my way, yeah
You can never say ""I love you"" too many times a day
I ain’t have no GPS (One, two, three, four)
When I was sick ain’t nobody go to CVS (Say i-it once more, uh)
They just wanna see me stressed (One, two, uh, three, four, uh)
They don’t wanna see me blessed (Say it baby once more, uh)
They cannot take away what I worked for
I know that I am worth mo-o-o-ore, yeahYou might also like2Embed"
