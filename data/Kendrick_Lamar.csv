[Intro: Kendrick Lamar, Sam Dew & Whitney Alford]
I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
(Tell them, tell 'em, tell them the truth)
I hope you find some paradise
(Tell 'em, tell 'em the truth)
(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em your—)
I've been goin' through somethin'
One-thousand eight-hundred and fifty-five days
I've been goin' through somethin'
Be afraid

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killing her
What is a relative making repetitive narratives
On how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents' evil thirst
What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity
I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (Woah)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up because time was imperative (Woah)
Started to feel like it's only one answer
To everything, I don't know where it is (Woah)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (Woah)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Woah)
Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?
I'm flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself and my life and my music
The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing
The demons portrayed as religionous
I wake in the morning, another appointment
I hope the psychologist listenin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The ""Where you from?"", it was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible
Eyes like green penetratin' the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world, ""I'm busy""
Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn't care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was twenty-one
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye
Chad left his body after we FaceTimed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So what, paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamics on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT
Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions
Poverty was the case
But the money wipin' the tears away
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I grieve different
(Everybody grieves different)

I grieve different (Huh)64Embed"

Hello, new world, all the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside, but they still lied
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, ""I'm broke, I care"" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag
(Take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

[Chorus]
Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You outta pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us (You outta pocket—shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us (Get back in pocket)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run

Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love, this ain't monogamy, y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

[Chorus]
Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Baby Keem]
Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith
Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm bracking, look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Hold up, hold up)
Let's think about this for a second (Let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (Let's go)
Would you sell your soul on credit? (Let's go)
Would you sell your bro for leverage? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)

[Outro]
Huh, huh, ugh
You outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket (This shit hard)
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it (This shit hard)
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic (This shit hard)
What your life like? Bullshit and gossip (This shit hard)
What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg?
Say what I want about you niggas, I'm like Oprah, dawg
I treat you crackers like I'm Jigga, watch, I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic? That ain't protocol (Bitch)122Embed"

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' ""Baby Shark"" with my daughter
Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through
Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messagin' bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that's what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort
I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi
Paid it forward, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy
Sciatica nerve pinch, I don't know how to feel
Like the first time I fucked a white bitch

The first time I fucked a white bitch
I was sixteen at the Palisades
Fumblin' my grades, I traveled with the team
The apache life, Centennial was like
When Mrs. Baker screamed at Doughboy
Mixed that with Purple Rain
They interchanged the scenes
Happy just to be out the hood
With all the wealthy kids
Credit cards and family plans
She drove her daddy's Benz
I found out that he was a sheriff
That was a win-win
Because he had locked up Uncle Perry
She paid her daddy's sins
Next time I fucked a white bitch
Was out in Copenhagen
​good kid, m.A.A.d city tour
I flourished on them stages
Whitney asked did I have a problem
I said, ""I might be racist""
Ancestors watchin' me fuck was like retaliation

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers
Non-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)
Hollywood corporate in school, teachin' philosophies
You either gon' be dead or in jail, killer psychology
Silent murderer, what's your body count? Who your sponsorship?
Objectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (What the—)
The media's the new religion, you killed the consciousness (What the fuck?)
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (What the fuck?)
Niggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)
If your opinion fuck 'round and leak, might as well send your will (What the—)
The industry has killed the creators, I'll be the first to say (What the fuck?)
To each exec', ""I'm saving your children""—We can't negotiate (What the—)
I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient
But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin'
So what's the difference 'tween your life when hiding motives?
More fatalities and reality bring you closure
The noble person that goes to work and pray like they 'posed to?
Slaughter people too, your murder's just a bit slower

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch (What the fuck?)

You really need some therapy
Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin' about?
Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck
Shit, everybody stupid
Yeah, well, you need to talk to somebody
Reach out to Eckhart

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I come from a generation of home invasions and I got daddy issues, that's on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see
Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, ""Fuck a foul""
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my lifе
Daddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don't take those well
Momma said, ""That boy is exhausted,"" he said, ""Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin,"" I got up quick
I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues

I got daddy issues, that's on me
Lookin' for, ""I love you"", rarely empathizin' for my relief
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee
'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself
Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
His momma died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon?
His first reply was, ""Son, that's life, and bills got no silver spoon""
Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'n'em
This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love
Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga
When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused
Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do
Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (Ah)
Need assistance with the way I was brought up (Ah, ah)
What's the difference when your heart is made of stone
And your mind is made of gold
And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul?
My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin'
Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta
I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves
'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was
And to my partners that figured it out without a father
I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues

I learned in trappin', in the business
Smart people makin' horrible decisions, you know?
Rich nigga, gettin' my dick sucked after the show
I ain't gon' lie, we were poor
A bunch of lost souls in survival mode
It wasn't no way for us unless we found our own
Runnin' in stores, kickin' in doors, nigga, give me my glory
Nigga play with me, he ain't gon' live to tell the story
You know, this the type of shit we glorify, everybody gang-gang
Most of the people that you grew up with are now in the chain gang
In the box, gettin' pink
Niggas shittin' where you sleep
Niggas shittin' whеre you eat
Who'da evеr knew that I'd become a fuckin' Kodak? Yeah
Rap money good, but I'm still pumpin' gas through the hood
Droppin' off plates to the fam' like Thanksgivin'
Got the baby snipers standin' on that murk business, yeah, slidin' for Yak
They ready for whatever
I always knew that everything would get better
And it sho' got greater later
All the game came from the elders like hand-me-downs
Me and my brothers wearin' hand-me-downs
Now I'm givin' game back to the old heads
And the respect come first, yeah, you know?
Can't be better than the OGs, you gotta get it somewhere
Gotta come from somethin', God don't come from nothin'
We ain't seen this comin', nigga, it's more than a blessin'
What you doing with Kendrick? (Ooh, ooh)
What you doing with a legend? (Ooh, ooh)
So what they call you? (Ooh, ooh)
When it's all said and done, we ain't leavin' empty-handed (Ooh, ooh)
That's on gang (Ooh, ooh)
That's on Ma' Dukes (Ooh, ooh)
Poorer than that bitch but she fall through  (Ooh, ooh)
Makin' ends meet (Ooh, ooh), daddy deadbeat (Ooh, ooh)
Had to steal for a meal or you can't eat, you know? (Ooh, ooh)
Poverty (Ooh, ooh)
Red Cross, food banks, W.I.C. (Ooh, ooh)

Takin' my baby to school, then I pray for her
'Cause you bitches ain't never been cool, writin' testament
Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that's a definite
Universal shift, I'm in a groove
And celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
I'm a good man, shake your hand, firm grip rule
Seventy-two wins, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
More than two M's for a show, but add another two
Hmm, lil' Man-Man, the big mans
The GT Dyno flippin' the kickstand, ooh

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Sam Dew]
Rich nigga, broke phone (Ah)
Tryna keep the balance, I'm stayin' strong (Ooh)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Yeah)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Ooh)
Ayy, bitch, I'm attractive (Ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh (Ooh)
Bitch, I'm attractive (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The morality can wait, feedback on low latency, I'm glitching from the face
As my thoughts grow sacredly, I'm runnin' out of space
Ask Whitney, she okay, never mind a hundred K
Why you lyin' on Benjamin? He turnin' in his grave
I'd be lyin' if I said I wouldn't give this shit away
The aloof Buddha, I'm Christ with a shooter
Praise to Muhammad, I might nigga noose ya
AP, Michael Friedman, my friends cooler
Primary, so the resale value stupid
I would never live my life on a computer
IG'll get you life for a chikabooya
More power to ya, love 'em from a distance
Why you always in the mirror more than the bitches?
And my cousin tried to sue me like he got the privilege
But I didn't lose sleep 'cause I got the spirit, ayy (Ooh)

We headed there now, are you strapped, brother?
Ayy, peacemaker, but I'm not naive, brother
Ayy, gotta watch your homies and police, brother
Ayy, clout chasing hell of a disease, brother
I'm fasting four days out the week, brother
I pray to God that you realize the entourage is dead
I pray to God that you not lackin' when you off the meds
I pray to God she know them Cabo trips don't last forever
Bet she argue with her momma, go and get them kids
I pray to God you actually pray when somebody dies

I swear, I'm tired of these emotional-ass, ungrateful-ass bitches (Shut the fuck up)

You wanna bring a nigga down, even when I'm tryna do right
We could go our separate ways right now, you could move on with your life, I swear to God
Fuck you, nigga, you love a pity party, I won't show up
Always act like your shit don't stink, motherfucker, grow up (Man, fuck you)
Forever late for shit, won't buy shit, sit around and deny shit (Man)
Fuck around on a side bitch, then come fuckin' up my shit
What? Fuckin' up yo' shit? You must be bleedin' and some more shit
Bitch, I don't know shit, fuck yo' feelings, you on some ho shit
See, I don't know why you likе playin' mind games with me (Mind games, man, c'mon, bro, likе, God)
Bitch, I ain't slow nor ditsy, I know when you bein' distant (Come on, dawg)
I know when you fake busy get out yo' feelings and miss me with that reverse psychology
Man, bitch, you trippin', who got you that Rollie chain?

[Verse 2: Taylour Paige & Kendrick Lamar]
Wastin' my time and energy tryna be good to you
Lost friends, family, gained more enemies 'cause of you
Bitches starin' at me at Zara, hoes scratchin' my cars up
Shoulda followed my mind in '09 and just moved to Georgia
Oh, what, that's my fault now? Bitch, you power trippin' or guilt trippin'? (Okay)
I held your ass down
You just kept me down, that's a big difference (Man)
Stressin' myself tryna figure why I'm not good enough
Goin' to church, prayin' for you, searchin' for good in us
Lil' dick-ass nigga that's tryna go big
But you was suckin' this dick though
Well, shit, I shoulda sucked his
What you say?
I shoulda found a bigger dick, man, bitch, get the fuck out my face
Oh, what, you mad?
Shut up, bitch, you got me fucked up today, on God
Ah-ha, you mad, lil' feelings is shot
Go text that raggedy bitch and tell her you all that she got
Man, what bitch?
Let her know you packin' yo' shit and gotta move by the first
Man, give me these fuckin' keys
Give me my keys, I'ma be late for work
Fuck yo' job, today gon' be the day you walk to that bitch
Give me my fuckin' keys
Nah, I like you parked in that bitch
Give me my keys, bro
On God, you ain't gettin' these keys
Give me my fucking keys
Ah, now you mad at me, I got you hollerin' for nothin'
I do the same when we fuckin'
Act like that pussy ain't loose
I'd rather act like I'm cummin'
I'd rather fuck off the juice, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
I'd rather fuck on your cousin
Bitch, you said you gon' fuck who?

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Taylour Paige]
I don't even know why I fuck with you
I'll be damned if I stuck with you
Changed my number, I'm duckin' you, bitch
Bitch, whatever is comfortable
Shit, this the type of shit couples do?
Shoulda thought about cuffin' you, bitch
Nigga, you dirty and you broke
Ho, you goofy and gullible, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Mm-mm, the insecurities you got, won't mind-fuck me
Womanizer, got no affection from yo' mama, I see
Don't speak on my mama, the fuck is yo' problem, bitch?
That bitch don't like me anyways
Bitch, she gave you the Honda, fuck you
And used that shit to throw it in my face (Man, hol' on, bro)
Find it funny you just can't apologize (This bitch, dawg)
Egotistic, narcissistic, love, you're all lies (Bro)
See, you the reason why strong women fucked up
Why they say it's a man's world, see, you the reason for Trump
(You crying, bro?)
You the reason, we overlooked, underpaid, under-booked, under shame
If you look, I don't speak, then I'm called on my name (Hah...)
I am flawed, I am pained, never yours, I remained (Come on, bro)
You the reason bitches start fuckin' with bitches when they change
You the reason bitches start callin' y'all bitches 'cause y'all useless (Alright)
You the reason Harvey Weinstein had to see his conclusion
You the reason R. Kelly can't recognize that he's abusive
Man, shut the fuck up, we all know you still playin' his music
Said I'm tired of these emotional-ass, ungrateful-ass bitches
Fake innocent, fake feminist, stop pretendin'
Y'all sentiments ain't realer than what you defendin'
(Here he go, shut the fuck up)
It's a split decision, broads like you and real victims (Look at you, look at you)
Let's talk the truth (Okay), women in general just can't get along (Explain, nigga)
Hmm, when Tash got a man, you didn't pick up the phone (Explain, nigga)
Uh-uh, when Nate got a job, you said you stayin' home (Explain)
Oh, why R&B bitches don't feature on each other songs then?
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Never mind, bitch, I'm walkin' out
Whatever, nigga, I'm off you now
Yo' evil ass kept me well in doubt
Pussy nigga, best watch your mouth
Pussy and mouth is all you got
Lay this pussy back on the couch
Doggie style, then you get on top
[Interlude: Taylour Paige & Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck me, nigga (I'ma fuck you, bitch)
Nah, fuck me, nigga, fuck me (I'ma fuck you, bitch)

A woman's worth, I barely went to church, I'd rather fast with you
Than fuck it up, fucking with skirts 'cause I'm rational
A nigga still gon' be a nigga, emoji heart, my family pictures
Two-steppin' away from rappers, I don't trust their true intеntions
I'm not in the music business, I been in the human businеss
Whole life been social distant, hoes like when you not trippin'
I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti
They gon' judge yo’ life for a couple likes on the double tap
Them hoes is sorry, they all get bodied
I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive
I bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal

We may not know which way to go on this dark road
(Mr. Duckworth)
All of these hoes make it difficult
Session 10, breakthrough

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's when I unite
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?
(And I'm tripping and falling)
It's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
Sleep, I ain't nevеr had affairs with that
What's fair when the hearts and thе words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
(And I'm tripping and falling)
I care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much
I shut down too, I ain't there too much
I'm a complex soul, they layered me up
Then broke me down, and morality's dust, I lack in trust
(And I'm tripping and falling)
This time around, I trust myself
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Look myself in the mirror
Amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
I fought like a pitbull terrier
Blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, ""Carry 'em""
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived
Even my strong points couldn't survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg

How you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (Wah, woo, wah)
How you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep? (Sheesh)
Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (Vroom, vroom)

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (Huh, huh)

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?

Ain't nobody but the mirror lookin' for the fall off (Brrrt)

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo
It's gon' take more than pride to stop me
Call 9-1-1, I caught a body
Sun up now, and yesterday is fadin'
Healing's only 'bout a mile away
Let me tell you 'bout the woman I know (That's my baby)
I know karma like to follow us strong (Sheesh)
I know millionaires that feel alone (Sheesh)
Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
Many find they life in a phone
[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You said I'd feel better if I just worked hard without liftin' my head up
That left me fed up
You made me worry
I wanted my best version, but you ignored me
Then changed the story, then changed the story
Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please
(Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated)
Tryna keep my good conscience in rotation
Thoughts in my head, they livin' there with no— (Tryna keep my good)
I made a decision, never give you my feelings
Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
Some put it on the Devil when they fall short
I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
Sometimes I fall for her, dawg

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & DJ Dahi]
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (True, true)

Miss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)
(Miss Regret) Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Some things I can't forget
Lord knows, I tried my best
You said it's not my best
I came up out my flesh
Something's up, must confess (Ah, ya)

You walk around like everything is in control
Favor come with favors and you can't say no
Go out the way to make the coin available
That's what I call love
The closest ones afraid to say they need some time
The turnaround is life or death, but you don't mind
Go out the way to say you made the compromise
That's what I call love

[Pre-Chorus]
But the time it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
You say no and all you've done gives them amnesia
One thing I've learned, love can change with thе seasons

[Chorus]
And I can't please еverybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
I can't please everybody

Pull out the stick, hit a bitch with the wood
First to park Rolls Royce, 'vert in the hood
Don't worry about us, over here we good
The AP Roman numeral, everywhere I go, I need pharmaceuticals
I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin' shit out in the cubicle
Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot
Big ol' ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that bitch look like a Ring Pop
Money on my mind, money on your head
Can't ride three times while you comin' through the 'jects
Red Cross kept a nigga fed
In the studio with K. Dot fresh out the feds
Yeah, you niggas can't stand the rain, you niggas don't stand a chance
Yeah, Chevrolet candy paint, I spin the bend in the Benz
I caught a bale off a Google app
I'm the type to get my shooter whacked
I had to survive off a tuna pack
Five percent tint on the whip like, ""Who was that?""
Coupe take off like it's mad
Beat the dope with a fork, I'm whippin' up Sudafed, I'm doin' scams in the lab
Every Thursday, girl's day, spendin' time with my daughter, make me go harder
Every Sunday's son's day, teach my boy to be a man, I ain't had no father
Fell in the love with the block, I ain't have no pop, just a sawed-off shotgun, Mossberg
We stackin' that money up proper, awkward diamonds, look like marbles

If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let's say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you

[Verse: Baby Keem]
You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in them county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shootin' niggas, blood on the highway
Crossеs on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take evеrything that I ask for
Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showin' a pattern for certain
I think it's white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did forty-three shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way
Put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love
Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped off the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love
Catch us, you know I'm gon' rack up
I need the advance and the equity to match up
The engineer dead if the drive don't back up
These words come of God, you could never outrap us
Nowadays, gotta walk cautious, ayy
Nowadays, I'm a new prophet, ayy
Game dead, no autopsy, ayy
City girl with they new hobby, ayy
Catch a body, put the Prada in the ta-da
Nigga 'bout to get some pussy, give me five (Give me five)
Gun dirty, got the thirty in the purse, purse
Tight bitch, put a perky in her salad
I gotta pray for the basic
I never seen my niggas bust down faces
Them niggas not tasteless
I only had one chance, I ain't even waste it
Been down on my luck
Been down on my luck when I fa-a-all
I gotta get up
I gotta get back up and ba-a-a-all
R.I.P., under my people
I'm proud of my people, I'm proud of my dawgs
My ex got a beamer, she want me to see it
I still ain't gon' see it, like, okay
I love when they ratchet, I don't do her Patek
I still do the watches the old way
She think I'm conceited, I'm thinkin' 'bout cheatin'
I don't do the flowers or roleplay
Now, how can I fold lookin' at twenty million
This money don't come with a probate
Mama, I said it'd be okay

Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can't—
Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
This is how we conceptualize human beings

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager, off-white Guess jacket
Blue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits
'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest
Big social, big personality, vocal
Played the underground verbatim and stayed local
My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinking, ""I want me a bad bitch when I get big""
They hug on the corner like California King
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratching the likes from lotto
Hoping that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six-by-nines keeping the music up under me
My auntie is a man now
Asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, ""Ain't no tellin'
Niggas always been jealous because he had more women
More money and more attention made more envy
Calling him anything but broke was less offending""

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say, ""Faggot""
""Faggot, faggot, faggot,"" we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it
She wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference
That's what I told my friends in second grade
She picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face
They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed
We pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing
My auntie is a man now, what a relationship
I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit
He gave me some cash then gave me some game
Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained
She even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade
The first person I seen write a rap
That's when my life had changed
House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window
Cameras on the microphone, all women and men know
My auntie was a man now, we cool with it
The history had trickled down and made us ign'ant
My favorite cousin said he's returning the favor
And following my auntie with the same behavior
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
He's more confident to live his plan now (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
But the family in disbelief this time (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
Convincing themselves, ""He ain't living discreet, he's fine"" (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
The Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
He built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over
He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
""Faggot, faggot, faggot,"" we ain't know no better
Middle school kids with no filter, however
I had to be very mindful of my good cousin
I knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
I mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further
Changed his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain
Living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon
We didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant
Wasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive
But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor
Made raw, but time changes all

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Remember church, Easter Sunday?
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith
More spiritual when these dudes were living life straight
Which I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same
He said my cousin was going through some things
He promised the world we living in was an act on abomination
And Demetrius was to blame
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman
Wondering if God still call you a decent man
Still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
Until he singled you out to prove his point, saying
""Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Church, his auntie is a man now,"" it hurt
You the most 'cause your belief was close to his words
Forcing me to stand now
I said, ""Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?
The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?
I recognize the study she was taught since birth
But that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved""
The building was thinking out loud, bad angel
That's when you looked at me and smiled, said, ""Thank you""
The day I chose humanity over religion
The family got closer, it was all forgiven
I said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better
Mistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different
See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound
If ever they was pronounced without any intentions
The very second you challenged the shit I was kicking
Reminded me about a show I did out the city
That time I brung a fan on stage to rap
But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me
You said, ""Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction
To truly understand love, switch position
'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together
But only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'""48Embed"

It was one of the worst performances I've seen in my life
I couldn't sleep last night because I felt this shit–
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yee

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Enoch, your father's just detoxed, my callin' is right on time
Transformation, I must had a thousand lives
And like three thousand wives
You should know that I'm slightly off
Fightin' off demons that been outside
Better known as myself, I'm a demigod
Every thought is creative, sometimes, I'm afraid of my open mind

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Shit on my mind, and it's heavy
Tell you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More lifе to give on demand, are you rеady?
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (Us)
When there's no one to call

Don't need no conversation
If it ain't 'bout the business, shut the door now
Bitch, it's a celebration
And if this shit ain't bussin', what's it for now?

Steppin' out when the weight lifts
Floatin' on 'em (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uzi, your father's in deep meditation
My spirit's awakened, my brain is asleep
I got a new temperature
Sharpenin' multiple swords in the faith I believe
I think about Robert Kelly
If he weren't molested, I wonder if life'd fail him
I wonder if Oprah found closure
The way that she postered the hurt that a woman carries
My mother abused young
Like all of the mothers back where we from
SSI bury family members
At the repass, they servin' Popeyes chicken
What you know about Black trauma?
F&Ns, kickin' back is another genre
Tyler Perry, the face of a thousand rappers
Using violence to cover what really happen
I know somebody's listenin'
Past life regressions to know my conditions
It's based off experience
Karma for karma, my habits insensitive
Watchin' my cousin struggle with addiction
Then watchin' her firstborn make a million
And both of them off the grid for forgiveness
I'm sacrificin' myself to start the healin' and...
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Shit on my mind and it's heavy
Tell you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (Us)
When there's no one to call us (Us)

[Outro: Tanna Leone, Kendrick Lamar, Eckhart Tolle]
Say, ""Hydrate, it's time to heal""
Safe, you're frustrated, I can feel

I'm sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody
One man standin' on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five
I still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision
In the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic
Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today
I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape
My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
Starin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night
Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover
Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober

[Chorus: Beth Gibbons]
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas
Family ties, they accused my cousin, ""Did he touch you, Kendrick?""
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said ""He didn't""
Frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself
I started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself
Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help
Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy
Water watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
Spirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me
""Did he touch you?"" I said ""No"" again, still they didn't believe me
Mother's brother said he got revenge for my mother’s face
Black and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase
'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over
Blame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind
I need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined
I did it sober sittin' with myself, I went through all emotions
No dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer
Intoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention
Insecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women
Whitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen
Askin' God, ""Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?""
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, ""Is there an addiction?""
I said ""No,"" but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it
Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me
Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy
I asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her ""No""
I never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic
Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection
Though it never happened, she wouldn't agree
Now I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced
Amplified as I write this song, I shiver 'cause I'm nervous
I was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years
Nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel
I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood
But Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could
All those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked
I pray our children don't inherit me and feelings I attract
A conversation not bein' addressed in Black families
The devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other
Psychotic torture between our lives, we ain't recovered
Still livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance
Every other brother has been compromised
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused
I see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos
So listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school
His anger grows deep in misogyny
This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active
So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made
So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame
So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain
I hope Hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain
So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all
So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God
So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred
As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation
[Chorus: Beth Gibbons]
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

[Interlude: Whitney Alford]
You did it, I'm proud of you
You broke a generational curse
Say ""Thank you, dad""
Thank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother
Mr. Morale

I choose me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The pressure's taking over me, it's beginning to loom
Better if I spare your feelings and tell you the truth
Lately, I redirected my point of view
You won't grow waitin' on me
I can't live in the Matrix, huh
Rather fall short of your graces, huh
This time, I won't trade places, huh
Not about who's right, who's wrong, huh
Evolve, the only thing known, huh
Ask me when I'm coming home, huh
Blink twice again, I'm gone

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry

I was so low and mourning through the family feuds

'Cause all of it's toxic
Girl, I'm not relevant to givin' on profit
Personal gain off my pain, it's nonsense
Darlin', my demons is off the leash for a moshpit
Baby, I just had a baby, you know she need me
Workin' on myself, the counselin' is not easy
Don't you point a finger just to point a finger
'Cause critical thinkin' is a deal-breaker
Faith in one man is a ship sinking
Do yourself a favor and get a mirror that mirror grievance
Then point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom
She told me that she need me the most, I didn't believe her
She even called me names on the post, the world can see it
Jokes and gaslightin'
Mad at me 'cause she didn't get my vote, she say I'm triflin'
Disregardin' the way that I cope with my own vices
Maybe it's time to break it off
Run away from the culture to follow my heart
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I realized true love's not savin' face
But unconditional
When will you let me go?
I trust you'll find independence
If not, then all is forgiven
Sorry I didn't save the world, my friend
I was too busy buildin' mine again

As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment
Residue burned, mist of the inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain
Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard
That's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved
I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams
The culture

Look what I done for you (Look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Hair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'
Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya
Remote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya
The streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin'
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion
Water in between us, another peer's been executed
History repeats again
Make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it
But that's the culture, crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you're sober
By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over
That's the problem
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Dehumanized, insensitive
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I
Enemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you
In the land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya, nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
Fuck callin' it culture

Take the drums out

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered
Temptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures
I felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry
But all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered
Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Paid dues, made rules, change outta love
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun
Should I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?
Everything is everything, this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence
To my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven
To my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven
To my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven
To my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings
To my fans, make sure you make them investments
And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you, just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved
I completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave
But fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased
I can't stress how I love y'all
I don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all
And Sam, I'll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live out our dreams we produced
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
Look for salvation when troubles get real
'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won't reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still
I want you201Embed"

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
*Gunshot*

Ever since a young man (Since a young man)
All I wanna be was a gunman (Was a gunman)
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the brats
Don't judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge! Don't judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me! If I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me! Won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon’ see—

Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

[Bridge]
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Asked for a piece of mind, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous

Poverty's paradise
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth
(I've been hungry all my life)

[Voicemail: Carl Duckworth]
What's up, family?
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, ""The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart""
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...

[Bridge 1: Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr. & Kendrick Lamar]
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?

You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken

I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make

Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs

I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bridge 2: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom177Embed"

Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—

Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, ""It's okay""

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar & RAT BOY]
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—

[Verse 1 (cont'd): Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy—hol' up
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Something came over me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat

Lyrics[Intro]
Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil’, hol’ up, lil' bitch)

Lyrics[Intro: Bēkon]
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin’ with cold thumb
I’m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there

Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)

I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option
[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

[Bridge]
Damned if I do, if I don't (Yuh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (Yuh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way

[Verse 3]
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element288Embed"

New shit, new Kung Fu Kenny

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close, get money, fuck bitches
I double-parked the Aston in the red
My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream: ""That's Uncle Kendrick!""
Yeah, that's the business (Uno)
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed

But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah

I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix

Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors

Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate

Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith

Lyrics[Intro: Bēkon]
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
""Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it""
She replied, ""Oh, yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life""
*Gunshot*

[Bridge: Bēkon]
Is it wickedness?

[Outro: Eric Bolling & Kimberly Guilfoyle]
Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote
""And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'""

I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga

Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element288Embed"

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—

I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millennium
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now

I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king

Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin’ with cold thumb
I’m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there

Nobody pray for me

Way (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

I need some water

God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst—
New Kung Fu Kenny!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks
He'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
He'll make it (He'll make it)
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin'
Woah (Woah)
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!,"" X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (No mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—

Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera

Poverty's paradise
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth
(I've been hungry all my life)

[Voicemail: Carl Duckworth]
What's up, family?
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, ""The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart""
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...

[Bridge 1: Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr. & Kendrick Lamar]
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?

I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away

I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bridge 2: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom177Embed"

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
*Gunshot*

Lyrics[Intro: Bilal]
Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh, you want it? Oh, you want it right now
Like that? I got you, baby
All on you, baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy, baby

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory, life no—
I seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory
Life no longer infinity, this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys, run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""He's alive!""
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) No more running from world wars
(It's happening) No more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) No more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold, the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from Heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
""What have you did for me?""
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to Hell
Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix anytime I need
Amistad, chain evidence in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

Lyrics[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said ""You know what, girl? You crazy."" Then she asked me what he said...
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What did the Asian say?) ""A peace of mind""
That's what the Asian said—I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said ""taking my time
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?""
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What did the Indian say?) ""A piece of land""
That's what the Indian said—I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(Now, what the black man say?) ""A piece of pussy""
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said, ""Nigga, come back to reality for a week""
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it

(What the white man say?) A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
""Look at what you accomplishing""; what he said to the boy
""I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece""
[Chorus: Bilal]
I holler, ""What you do? What you say?""
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, ""What you do? What you say?""
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today

Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And this I know
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk
How come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone

He drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle
Lit off Henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God and still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade

Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl

I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor
Let me explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you how
I can explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain

[Verse 1: CeeLo Green]
I'm bizarre, avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive, you're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make-believe?
Anything you want to know (I can explain)
I can explain it
Any misunderstandings, baby (Let me explain)
I can explain it
Why don't you sit and talk to me a while? (I can explain)
Let me explain it, ahh yes (Let me explain)

But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are

[Bridge 2: Kendrick Lamar & CeeLo Green]
I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand-washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed the mind and soul
I can explain
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
Let me explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the odd
I am yours
I can explain
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours

[Interlude: Egypt]
Compton is where I'm from
Is where I'm from, where is I'm from

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist, die countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind, until my next album, more power to you
*Gunshot*
[Part III]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]

This is a fifteen minute song (Ahahaha)
We're just jammin' out, we on stage

Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note

You see, you see, you see, you see (Right)
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uh
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, (Mhm) truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]
But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now (Hahahaha)

Lyrics[Chorus]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
[Verse 1]
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you, uh
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute!
You might also like[Chorus]
Now, why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Verse 2]
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
[Chorus]
Why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Verse 3]
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (Broke home baby)
You know the poverty stricken the little broke born babies (Broke born babies)
Somebody yell ""Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy""
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said ""nigga you fucked up""
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town
[Interlude]
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

[Chorus]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Sample: Boris Gardiner]
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?
[Intro: Josef Leimberg]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To Pimp a Butterfly

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)

Tossed and turned, lesson learned

Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?
[Break: Dr. Dre]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (We’re on top together)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently, all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich

The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Whitney Alford]
Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
We want the funk

Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?

Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Interlude: Anna Wise & Bilal]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!

Life, can be like, a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:

[Chorus: Bilal]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""
[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said
[Chorus: Bilal]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service220Embed"

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
*Woman moaning*
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk—
Sex
[Verse 1: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no
You might also like[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat, & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)Oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat, & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Oh, oh
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat, & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh) Oh, oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room285Embed"

Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too

(Loving you ain't really complicated)
""Housekeeping, housekeeping""

[Beat Switch]
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed,"" you ain't try

[Break]
*Sniffling*

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulping*
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world
About that shit you thinkin' and that time you *gulping*, I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk it'd say, ""You gotta go""
And if I told your secrets the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness449Embed"

Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late

Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico, ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room

'Cause I (Want you)
(I want you more than you know)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (Want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, ""You crazy?""
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (Want you)

I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (Want you)
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, ""Where's Ricardo?""
You said, ""Oh, no, not the show""
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, ""Oh, shit""
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
""My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible""
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (Want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty

[Poem]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home108Embed"

[Part I]

[Intro: Taz Arnold & Lalah Hathaway]
—that dream
Oh, shit!
I need that (So it seems)
I need that sloppy
That sloppy (Yo, yo, yo, —that dream)
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Yeah
That sloppy (So it seems)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack (Ooh-ooh)
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it, in fact (Yeah)
You admitted it once I submitted it, wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now, I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap
I would say it got me a plaque, but what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home

I know everything
I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything
I know Compton, I know street shit,I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded—well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
I know what I know, and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn’t know shit, the day I came home
[Chorus: Lalah Hathway & Taz Arnold]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
Bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy, black ankles
Breakin' new laws, mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted""
Oh, I forgot, ""Don't Kill My Vibe,"" that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
To come back home""
[Part II]

I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money or mankind?
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite

Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something, think I'm losing my mind, ah!
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I say, where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is161Embed"

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil' hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
Fourteen years later, going hard like we used to
On the dead homies
On the dead homies
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
Our lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now, here, if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop
Flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes, ""Sherm sticks, burn this""
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50-nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Co's, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, ""The enemies done cliqued up""
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everything is everything, it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas' names on paper—you snitched all summer
Streets don't fail me now
They tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress
Set-trippin' all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-icans
Red state versus a blue state—which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs, make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, ""What it do?""
[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
""K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box""
I box 'em all in, by a landslide
Nah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the Coast involved, then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said, ""It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game""
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
I was entering a new one236Embed"

How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more""
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need""
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga, you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God""
[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs

Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (Dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga

By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, ""A woman is woman, love the creation""
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

Keep your head up when the juice stop, loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby, uh
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, twelve years a slave
Twelve years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain't talkin' ""Woo-hah!""
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don't see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that's the context
Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain't no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain't talkin' Jay, I ain't talkin' Bey
I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self-esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, know colors ain't a thing

Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, somethin' black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I hate everything black (We don't believe)
Black, I want all things black
I don't need black, I want everything black
I don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, I own everything black

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
[Chorus: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave cah me Black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
[Chorus: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave cah me Black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

[Intro]
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, babe, check it out, I'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like:
[Verse 1]
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name
[Refrain]
Askin' ""where the hoes at?"" to impress me
Askin' ""where the moneybags?"" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' ""where the plug at?"" to impress me
Askin' ""where the juug at?"" to impress me
Askin' ""where it's at?"" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
[Verse 2]
And the world don't respect you
And the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (Complex), emotional (Complex)
Self-pity (Complex), under oath (Complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context
[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

Askin' ""where the juug at?"" to impress me
Askin' ""where it's at?"" only upsets me

(Pause)
[Verse 3]
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi
Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
Bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
See, loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:
[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga

Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, hey, hey, turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(Ah, one two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
I done been through a whole lot (Kendrick Lamar)
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie (Make some noise, brother)
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah, yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I love my (I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, ah, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the poli'
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, huh

They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace (Oh, yeah)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me, motherfucker, I smile
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I love my (I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, ah, tell me what do you see?

Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the poli'

Uh, illuminated—
All y'all come to the front, y'all come up to the front
(I love myself)
Baby, what about you? Come on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving), turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
(I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, ah, tell me what do you see?

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right (Oh, no)
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night, woo)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body—
[Spoken Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
(*Offstage argument*)
Ayy, hold on, woah, woah, stop all this
Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time

Niggas gotta make time, bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time, right?
The judge make time so it ain't shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog

We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to, a—
All my niggas listen, listen to this:

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
He said, ""Think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats""
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hole us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question:

You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say;

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing; that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy's Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y'all
It's respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it's Michael Jackson—oh

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean,"" you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga

[Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac]
""I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man
Maybe I'm just another nigga”
Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga"" but, it ain't really a poem
I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that, what the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That's how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I'm saying Wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
Right
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be
There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?
Aight so let me ask you this then
Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin', I took the opportunities
I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years, you know what I'm saying?
I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying?
I made millions for the record companies
I made millions for these movie companies
Now I make millions for, for us
And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true""
Right
You know what I'm saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it's no problem, you know
I mean, it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know
I'm finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance
And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back
Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
""We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win
And I wanna lay it all down""
In this country, a black man only have like
Five years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn thirty it's like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man, in this country
And you don't wanna fight no more
And if you don't believe me, you can look around
You don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers
That's crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
There's nothing but turmoil goin' on so, I wanted to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
For real, I don't think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it's gonna be some more playing but
It ain't gonna be no playing
It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying?
It's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen
That's crazy, man, in my opinion
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
Lot a people don't understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
And I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out
Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes
Because it's spirits, we ain't even really rappin'
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It's actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world, it says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same""
What's your perspective on that?

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'

But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like ""wait""
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe

Up in the clouds
Me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down (Down, down)
Can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, I almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink, runnin' through that bitch
Like it's my house, all up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like twenty years straight
I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high (Fuck up my high)
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
Still be straight (Still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint
Smokin' this shit like I'm tryna prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral
Hahaha
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals
Niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was sixteen that I'd write a sixteen
To put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Shoulda been in the pen but now my pen writin' with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good god, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10-second drum solo
Bitch see you at Woodstock, ah!

You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can tell your energy is dangerous
You don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So what, So what?, So bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior

I'm a break out and then hide every lock
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!7Embed"

Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen

[Verse]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

Please leave your message for three-two-three

Kendrick, where you at?
Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
Man, I gotta go up to the county buildin', man, these kids ready to eat
I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on your way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit
'Specially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade
Eleventh grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Your daddy callin' about some damn dominoes (Let me holler at him)
He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
(Kenny), What?
I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (Oh), shit
Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin' dominoes
Just give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up, damn, let me
Kendrick, when you get this message, man, call me back (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard)
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car (And squab, homie)
This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment, fuck
Fuck some damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear your ass

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'

I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock

Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winnin', screamin'—

And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record

[Intro]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

[Chorus]
Smokin' on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Part II]
You might also like[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies
[Chorus 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Rémy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”
[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Chorus 2]
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')
[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

[Break]
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

[Verse 4]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it.""
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
(Police sirens)
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

[Outro]
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!

Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish, ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (Was persuasive, was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros, tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond ""Let It Burn"" came on (""Let Burn"" came on, ""Let Burn"" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind, free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs, see dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
A silver spoon, I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew, we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all-day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's jus how I feel
[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's jus' how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's jus' how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's jus' how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's jus' how I feel

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school, way after school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (Thinkin' rational, that's rational)
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head, my Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same, won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', that day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin', Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot o' gold (A pot o' gold, a pot o' gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
'Magine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings; liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em—get the fuck up out my way, bish!
Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bish!
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all-day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's jus' how I feel

Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations
You've been takin', clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' witcha other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane, take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]

You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof, I'm talkin'
Poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

""I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem.""
""Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ask him if he heard from Sherane

""I don't care who this nigga over here for

Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: ""What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?""
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from Bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: ""Lift up your shirt,"" because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: ""He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city.""
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now, this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Wake yo' punk-ass up
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga?)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""
[Break: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Verse 1]
Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Verse 2]
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch

Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Bridge]
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?

Sherane (Pool—Kendrick—Kendrick—lies in it)
Sherane, Sherane
(W-watch 'em all flock) Aw man…
Sherane (Girls wanna play-play-play)
Where is she takin' me? (I got)
Where is she takin' me? (Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in...)

[Verse 3]
All I—all I—all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
[Skit]
""They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off""
""That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'""
""We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' ru—they run opposite way
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that""
""And I hope that bitch that set him up, out there
We gon' pop that bitch too""
""Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody""
*Car door opens and gunshots are fired*
""Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?""
""L****, you good?""
""Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!""

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit…
[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Outro]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', oh, tired of huntin', oh
My own kind, but retirin' nothin', oh
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin', oh
Hands on the wheel, oh, who said we wasn't, oh
Dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, oh, look at the coroner, oh
Daughter is dead, oh, mother is mournin' her, oh
Stray bullets, oh, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't, oh
Bring her back, oh, who got the footage, oh?
Channel 9, oh, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked, oh
Banana clip, split his banana pudding, oh
I'm like Tre, oh, that's Cuba Gooding, oh
I know I'm good at, oh
Dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh

[Verse 3]
How many sins, oh? I'm runnin' out, oh
How many sins, oh? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce, oh
The reaper callin', oh, I'm cottonmouth, oh
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, oh, die with a coward, oh
Hope we get rich, oh, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder, oh
The same song, oh, a black flower, oh
I'll show you how to, oh
Dye your thirst, oh, dye your thirst, oh, dye your thirst, oh

[Verse 4]
What are we doin', oh? Who are we foolin', oh?
Hell is hot, oh, fire is proven, oh
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it, oh
Tired of runnin', oh, choirs is hummin', oh
Tell us to visit, oh, we lie about comin', oh
Now back to business, oh, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', oh, it's no discussion, oh
Hereditary, oh, all of my cousins, oh
Dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, oh, I'm runnin' out, oh
Somebody send me a well for the drought, oh
See all I know, oh, is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke, oh
My best days, oh, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, oh, I stress days, oh
Say ""fuck the world"", oh, my sex slave, oh
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave, oh
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', oh, tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""
[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe You raised Him from the dead""
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
""In Jesus' name, amen""

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen""
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
The reason why I know you very well
'Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat 'cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like ""because""
Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse 'cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse 'cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what y'all need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to.

""If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye.""

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it, my nigga?
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
You might also like[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

[Bridge]
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the Eastside
Know that's just how Compton roll

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar, Both]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'ma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
""Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla""
[Outro]
Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

Look inside of my soul and you can find
Gold and maybe get rich—hol' up

But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like ""wait""
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Up in the clouds
Me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down (Down, down)
Can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, I almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink, runnin' through that bitch
Like it's my house, all up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like twenty years straight
I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high (Fuck up my high)
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
Still be straight (Still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint
Smokin' this shit like I'm tryna prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral
Hahaha
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals
Niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was sixteen that I'd write a sixteen
To put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Shoulda been in the pen but now my pen writin' with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good god, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10-second drum solo
Bitch see you at Woodstock, ah!

Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen

[Verse]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich

I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower

[Verse 2]
I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yessir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum imposin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

[Chorus]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Post-Chorus 2]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time
[Verse 3]
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run that ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, ""K, you goin' marry mines""
Biatch! No way, biatch! No way
Biatch! No way, biatch! Okay
I'm never livin' life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell you who, what, when, where
How to sell your game right on time
Biatch! Go play, biatch! Go play
Biatch! Go play
Biatch, I look like O. J.​
Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin' in the street, yellin'—

[Chorus]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Post-Chorus 1]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower

[Intro]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

[Chorus]
Smokin' on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Part II]

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies
[Chorus 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Rémy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”
[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Chorus 2]
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')
[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

[Break]
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

[Verse 4]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it.""
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
(Police sirens)
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

[Outro]
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!

Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish, ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (Was persuasive, was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros, tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond ""Let It Burn"" came on (""Let Burn"" came on, ""Let Burn"" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind, free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs, see dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
A silver spoon, I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew, we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all-day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's jus how I feel
[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's jus' how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's jus' how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's jus' how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's jus' how I feel

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school, way after school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (Thinkin' rational, that's rational)
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head, my Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same, won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', that day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin', Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot o' gold (A pot o' gold, a pot o' gold)

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!

'Magine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings; liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em—get the fuck up out my way, bish!
Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bish!
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all-day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say

Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations
You've been takin', clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' witcha other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane, take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof, I'm talkin'
Poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: ""What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?""
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from Bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city

Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help

It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: ""Lift up your shirt,"" because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: ""He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city.""
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby142Embed"

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now, this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Wake yo' punk-ass up
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga?)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""
[Break: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Verse 1]
Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch

[Verse 3]
All I—all I—all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

""And I hope that bitch that set him up, out there

""Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody""

When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit…
[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Outro]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

Dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, oh, I'm runnin' out, oh
Somebody send me a well for the drought, oh
See all I know, oh, is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke, oh
My best days, oh, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, oh, I stress days, oh
Say ""fuck the world"", oh, my sex slave, oh
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave, oh
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', oh, tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""
[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe You raised Him from the dead""
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
""In Jesus' name, amen""
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life, your REAL life249Embed"

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen""
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
The reason why I know you very well
'Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat 'cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like ""because""
Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse 'cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse 'cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?
[Skit: Kenny Duckworth]
Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga

Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye.""

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it, my nigga?
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

[Bridge]
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the Eastside
Know that's just how Compton roll

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar, Both]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'ma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
""Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla""

(Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to)
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
Really though, it's never enough, ten million, that's a must
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive
Down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre]
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather

Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
""Ribbon In The Sky"" on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controlling my price?
No way, hell no, uh-uh
If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off

Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling
Anything out by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this

They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See if you fuck, then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first: Cali

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, you made it""
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, you made it""
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, you made it""
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it""
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it""
Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets
Making my conscience ask me
""Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?""
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly

I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, ""Oh shit, wait""
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God
(Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly)78Embed"

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am
You might also like[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth 'cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it's a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours
[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I see myself performing there, (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here
[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better75Embed"

[Intro: Kent Jamz]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Mama, take this motherfuckin' block off
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K. Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama, just get back at me this last time

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Mama, take this motherfuckin' block off
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay run?
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama, just get back at me this last time

Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women

Men lie, wo- women

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No, it's not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
'Member all the nights that I cried
Thinkin' that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kickin' through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this
[Pre-Chorus: Kent Jamz]
Men lie, wo- women lie

Men lie, wo- women lie

Look inside of my soul and you can find
Gold and maybe get rich—hol' up
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks
But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like ""wait""
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Up in the clouds
Me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down (Down, down)
Can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, I almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink, runnin' through that bitch
Like it's my house, all up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like twenty years straight
I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high (Fuck up my high)
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
Still be straight (Still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint
Smokin' this shit like I'm tryna prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral
Hahaha
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals
Niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was sixteen that I'd write a sixteen
To put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Shoulda been in the pen but now my pen writin' with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good god, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10-second drum solo
Bitch see you at Woodstock, ah!

[Intro: Emeli Sandé & Kendrick Lamar]
You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can tell your energy is dangerous
You don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So what, So what?, So bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand

I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand

Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen

[Verse]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock

I'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal

Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Verse 1]
Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winnin', screamin'—

I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yessir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record

This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

And I run that ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, ""K, you goin' marry mines""
Biatch! No way, biatch! No way

I'm never livin' life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind

[Intro]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

[Chorus]
Smokin' on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Part II]

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies
[Chorus 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Rémy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”
[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Chorus 2]
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')
[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

[Break]
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

[Verse 4]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it.""
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
(Police sirens)
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

[Outro]
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!

Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)

Home invasion was persuasive (Was persuasive, was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros, tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond ""Let It Burn"" came on (""Let Burn"" came on, ""Let Burn"" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind, free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs, see dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
A silver spoon, I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew, we never knew)

You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (Thinkin' rational, that's rational)
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head, my Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same, won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', that day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin', Pirellis skirtin')

'Magine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings; liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em—get the fuck up out my way, bish!
Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bish!
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all-day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's jus' how I feel

[Skit: Paula Duckworth & Kenneth Duckworth]
Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I-I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyway. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man is on one. He feelin' good as a motherfucker. Shit, I’m tryna get my thing goin', too. I'm going to Merlin' house. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feelin' good. Look, listen to him!
Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause you got a big ol' fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass. Girl, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol'—
See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain't even trippin' off them dominoes no more. Just bring the car back!

Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations
You've been takin', clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' witcha other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane, take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof, I'm talkin'
Poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, PS

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: ""What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?""
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from Bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city

Mass hallucination, baby

Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: ""Lift up your shirt,"" because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: ""He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city.""
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now, this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Wake yo' punk-ass up
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga?)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""
[Break: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

[Verse 1]
Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

All I—all I—all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit…
[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Outro]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

(On the phone)
""Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?""
""Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!""
""Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.""
""We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.""
""Bring a nigga back a black!""
""Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga… Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back.""

""Ahh, fuck… So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?""
""Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like… nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now.""
""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', oh, tired of huntin', oh
My own kind, but retirin' nothin', oh
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin', oh
Hands on the wheel, oh, who said we wasn't, oh
Dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, oh, look at the coroner, oh
Daughter is dead, oh, mother is mournin' her, oh
Stray bullets, oh, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't, oh
Bring her back, oh, who got the footage, oh?
Channel 9, oh, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked, oh
Banana clip, split his banana pudding, oh
I'm like Tre, oh, that's Cuba Gooding, oh
I know I'm good at, oh
Dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh

[Verse 3]
How many sins, oh? I'm runnin' out, oh
How many sins, oh? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce, oh
The reaper callin', oh, I'm cottonmouth, oh
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, oh, die with a coward, oh
Hope we get rich, oh, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder, oh
The same song, oh, a black flower, oh
I'll show you how to, oh
Dye your thirst, oh, dye your thirst, oh, dye your thirst, oh

[Verse 4]
What are we doin', oh? Who are we foolin', oh?
Hell is hot, oh, fire is proven, oh
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it, oh
Tired of runnin', oh, choirs is hummin', oh
Tell us to visit, oh, we lie about comin', oh
Now back to business, oh, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', oh, it's no discussion, oh
Hereditary, oh, all of my cousins, oh
Dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, oh, I'm runnin' out, oh
Somebody send me a well for the drought, oh
See all I know, oh, is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke, oh
My best days, oh, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, oh, I stress days, oh
Say ""fuck the world"", oh, my sex slave, oh
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave, oh
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', oh, tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""
[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe You raised Him from the dead""
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
""In Jesus' name, amen""
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen""
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
The reason why I know you very well
'Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat 'cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like ""because""
Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse 'cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse 'cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?
[Skit: Kenny Duckworth]
Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga

But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city...

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it, my nigga?
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
You might also like[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

[Bridge]
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the Eastside
Know that's just how Compton roll

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar, Both]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'ma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
""Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla""

Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie

[Intro]
(Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to)
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
Really though, it's never enough, ten million, that's a must
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive
Down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre]
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
""Ribbon In The Sky"" on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controlling my price?
No way, hell no, uh-uh
If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre]
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling
Anything out by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See if you fuck, then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first: Cali

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre]
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, you made it""
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, you made it""
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, you made it""
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it""
So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it""
Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets
Making my conscience ask me
""Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?""
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly
You might also like[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, ""Oh shit, wait""
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am
You might also like[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth 'cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it's a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours
[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I see myself performing there, (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here
[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better75Embed"

[Intro]
Greeting boys and girls (Greetings boys and girls)
My name is Petey P (My name is Petey P)
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (That’s right, that's right, that's right)
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)
And I’d like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal (And sing)
Your pop guns and fireworks (And sing)
And sing along (Along)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Sing along kids, sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah

[Verse 1]
Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...
I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin'
Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?
You might also like[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Am I right?
Spend it all in front of the county building
Oh!
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah

[Bridge]
And all the ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)
Ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)
[Verse 2]
Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (Uh-huh)
Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty (Yeah, yeah that)
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy (I won't)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
""Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out?"" He said, ""Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots""
That- that’s right the mothafuckin’ Rodney King...
You was with your daddy on Bullis Road
[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
That's crazy
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Don't forget, still sing along kids, still sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Please sing
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane34Embed"

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Playas always trying to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Then get you a table my nigga
Get you a table my nigga

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
No syrup in this cup but this that po' up
When you see me po' up, turn up til you throw up
Like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober
Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
One life, that's all we have, Ok lets toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor
Swim laps like Michael Phelps
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
With it we all trippin' off the hen like a female chicken
You with it? (Soulo)
Spread your wings, you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us

Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Swagged out king, yeah, nigga, I'm Puff, uh

Someone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that
Twisting off them molly caps

Worth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat
I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet

Aw man... where is she taking me...
Where is she taking me...
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep, and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
More, more, bless me more

Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more

Gather 'round
I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner
Know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
Listen
Keisha, Tammy, come up front
I recognize all of you
Every creed and color
With that being said
Fuck your ethnicity
You understand that?
We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you, all of you

[Intro: Alori Joh]
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high
Throw your hands up high

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body, but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga, look at that line, it's so diverse
They gettin' off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benzes, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God 'cause I got my sins up, ooh
Matter fact, don't mistake me for no fuckin' rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind them fuckin' cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it
I'm out of my mind, so don't you mind how much the cost is
Penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah, man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Gone postal, never freeze up when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiiPower

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tired of y'all, 'cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein
Before calculus, I was kicking that math
Dropping that science like an alchemist and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically, I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams
Get it right, get a life, I got two
That's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man, I'm fly
Put wings on my back
That a plane or an angel? Both
Like a pilot with a halo, woah
Gross

I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted

Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick, jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddlin'
With the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid, I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn

Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream

""Why you say that?"" She said, ""Where my drink at?""
""I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax""
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, ""Read between the lines,"" yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)

At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, ""Get it understood""

Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
From Heaven is where you got it from

From your lips all the way to your eyebrows

Live fast and die young
Who's willing to explain this story?

[Chorus]
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one)
Oh, oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one, one, one, one)

We're far from good, not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top down, screamin', ""We don't give a fuck""
Drink my forty-ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
'Cause the kids just ain't alright

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
Oh shit, nigga
Somethin' 'bout to happen
Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty keys under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to vigilante, '80s, so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you gettin' fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travelin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula, draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips, and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the '90s
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me

Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
And in retrospect, I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars, and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan
Rake the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
He coppin' some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
Newborn massacre
Hoppin' out the passenger with calendars 'cause your day comin'
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressin', my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours, sendin' me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right, just so you

You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I like to start it out from the bottom and build with you
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with you
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it and don't call me lyrical
'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet?
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On ""Wanna Be Heard,"" probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me gettin' what I deserve
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it

Church is definitely on the move and now we done took it up to the cathedral
'Cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
We out here rotating under the five P's
Proper preparation prevents poor performance, You know what I'm talking 'bout?
Doing my thing 'cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
From the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
Church is definitely on the move and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gon' expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself

And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

See me as a dollar sign 'til I resign or you report

Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumpin' ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" while a pervert yellin' at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough, don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give it all to her daddy, but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothin' really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she makin' ends meet

And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers, the dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs, he'd compromise
To no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she toppin' off police

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve-bunk on tour
She suddenly realize she'll never escape the allure
Of a Black man, white man needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner's redemption, that sounds foolish
And you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fuckin' reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song, mmm
My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

Real quick, Ali

[Chorus]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead), yes, sir (Amen), church
(He dead), I killed him (Amen), bitch

[Verse 1]
And this is rigor mortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead, amen)
That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the '70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch, you been livin' in debt with me
Dead 'em all and especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail that say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q

I wrapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to Bible study faster?
Your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
In lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see
[Chorus]

It go ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be
How far is heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
What I'm doing? I'm saying that I'm human, now people just
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin', a youngin' with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems
Mo' money, mo' drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life
But regardless I'ma—
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause I never know
When a bullet might hit me and I die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what I is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Hmm

[Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers, aww
Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more, do more
But tease her 'bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording
Swear, I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven, saying, ""They at it again""
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
Momma, I just wanna sing
Momma said, ""According to get everything"" (Uh)
""You gotta risk everything""
So I'm smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians (Corinthians)

What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
It's fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
Before they crop us out the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
But I seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear, one day, I'ma stop
My nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams?
(Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me)
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell, hell (Oh)
Lord forbid, the homies got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is Black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you could see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here, like, back in '04
Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator
In a system meant to disintegrate us (Ooh)
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
HiiiPower
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope

I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie? I do, Section.80
Your son'll play me if radio won't
Daughters that just turn one 'til twenty-one listen to Kendrick
For instance
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, my child, come on
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfuckin' being over dope-ass instrumentation

Section.80, HiiiPoWeR

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfuckin' pistol
Aimin' it at a pig, Charlotte's web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugarcoat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want a plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry, mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fuckin' widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord, come save me, the devil's working hard
He probably clockin' double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doin' the moonwalk, hopin' I blow up in time
'Cause 2012 might not be a fuckin' legend
Tryna be a fuckin' legend, the man of mankind
Who said a Black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late '80s
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
'Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
'Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

""I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in.""
""So what keeps you alive?""
""Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing.""
Thank you

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me ""Rap about life, not rap niggas""
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to ""Faith,"" and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice
I ain't lying
I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
It's kind of scary, ain't it?
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?
'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, ""The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?""
Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said 15
Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin'
But little did they know, I’m tryna' change the rules
That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions
Uppity bitches handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
In LA everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of y'all cats just don’t know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain’t doing this for my health, I’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look, the mastermind took the master's mind
Just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look, the mastermind took - (cough)

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & Kendrick Lamar]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga, oh
Where are we going? We should be slowing down
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
And we don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right, but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what it said to me
But the place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I’m off track like Dale Earnhardt
My liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio, I wanna tell him– ""Nah""

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
I'm tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer33Embed"

When my uncles
Served smokers

In front of our building, they was my heroes

This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

[Verse 1]
Uhh, and that's scary to me
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his P's
Nigga cue me in I'm a Peruvian drug lord
Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some keys
This is crack co-caine, I'm Kurt Co-bain
And I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, high you I'm a I-V
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack— STOP
I said a I-V cuz when I be in the studio, I shot
A needle in your veins, take it in vein
Or itch till your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on the cold turkey
I hate chickens but I do fuck pretty birdies
Where your girl at? Over the Pyrex, where my world at

That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track, it's a Reynold's wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap
Rapping heat, you can fall to defeat
If you don't pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet
I suppose this is bigger than life
This is probably everybody, Illuminati
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice of the party
I undress her like a Harley

Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab
You are reimbursed, put it on my tab

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit, love
I want diamonds, too: Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five; fresh out of school—that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired; ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin prolly did
Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga
You gon' make me flip and split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best; let it go, drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist, tryna go beyond the margin— margin
Maintaining my modest— modest as I dream
So while I go through all this— all this bullshit, what you call it
Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry
(""Hey, what's up, daddy?"")

How was your day?
Are you tipsy?""

Give me that, once you give me that, once again, it's on
Bitch, I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby momma, ""What it do?""
Where your friends at? I got long dick—what it is?
Go'n' poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, already
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you, blame it on the liquor, babe
Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ugh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
And caught that flat in the mean T-Flats
And it made me think if we could blink
To change locations where we at
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due, and you 'bout to get evicted
Two drugs, surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and that bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
The antidote wouldn't last, and you knew it, nigga
But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her Zodiac sign

I'm going through something with life

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Okay, welcome to my diary—hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step; man, I hate to work for them
One time, I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
(Soul!) Balls deep, you dig?
Retrieve relief, you dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would you?
What's up?
I had a long day, and I really wanna fuck
Take a double-shot to the face and forget about my whole day
'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day (Whole day, whole day)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
And so he said ""Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
And when niggas holla, ""What's up?"" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me?
Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you"" (Sometimes)

And so she said ""Why you gotta be so mean to me?

Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?

Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even though you get violent and put your hands on me?""
Sometimes
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

[Bridge: JaVonté]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Outro: Lamont Carey]
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love90Embed"

I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ugh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' ""Me Against the World""—hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes

[Break: Kendrick Lamar]
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce, ho
Bounce-bounce

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on them twenty-sixes, I’m a vanity slave
I’m a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
I’m a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper
A.K.A ""that nigga,"" don't wuwwy!
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
This is HiiiPower, since the Eddie Bauer, I been popular
I’m popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come
You jocking her, let her be a ho, why you stopping, though?
We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks?
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
Seen too many of y’all getting money, know my turn coming
I don’t know why your bitch wanna fuck me
I don’t know why (Hey, wait a minute, motherfucker)

Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible

Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it (Aye)

Man, I know I can’t tell you about the world, homie
But I know I can tell you about your girl, homie

Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round
Told me Mary was a go, so we passed her 'round and 'round
Your bitch texted me, wants it now, so I had to knock her down
Hurt her, bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home runs, clean her dugout 'til I’m done

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Lord forgive me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kill him where he stand and stand over him, shake his hand
Then jump back in that minivan, double back to his block and blam
I ain't backing down for nothing, I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand, better pray that this chopper jam
Like a radio single, man, Police radio signals saying
That a 187 land on your corner, coroners comfort your momma
""Momma, he's dead,"" the next morning, I toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from, uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished, I don't know, I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumping on enemies I'm headhunting
No sympathy, ain't no love, when you in these streets, just get something
Protect your neck 'cause they coming for set respect, split your onion
Then chop your deck, your head tumbling like gymnastics (Ooh...)
'Cause ignorance is bliss

Now everybody put your hands up high

This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
Then peel off in a hoopty
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, I'm too street—indubitably, I'ma do me
Better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game—I'm including the planet
Cats so watered-down, clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around they neck and watch 'em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, you a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be calling me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves... that ignorance is bliss
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call Ghostbusters
'Cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you are, then wreck your car
Then walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein' seventeen, wishin' someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
'Cause ignorance is bliss

This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6th

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping?
If what I write down don't collect this very moment
Then I'm on it, no question
In the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet
This is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo
Track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
""I thought you had a show?"" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting
Two-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck hip-hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover Dam, water, sherm
Contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
You'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing
But lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga, ""Front me, let me put it on the strip""
Then give it back when I think about the consequence
Shit...

There are times, when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
Special for you, and me yeah

Before they pass, they pass, they pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You've got to look at the other side

One time
Reporting live
Compton, California

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
And life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing
I was so sincere like Nas' first name in Belly
They tell me, it's very difficult to see 25
And if I survive it's probably with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Alori Joh]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (Fighters)
We are, we are (True)
Through the, through barbed (Wires)
We will, will break (Through)
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past

Tryna get away from the world's stereotype

In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She'll never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she

You finally got right? No longer a black sheep

In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like we just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God, cause golly
You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
And both of y’all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out

[Chorus 3: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Alori Joh]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They gone tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad
Know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path
Through the barbed wire (Just laugh)
Then everybody say...
'Cause I won't get caught again
And I'm here to stop the trends
You can catch me if you try
Disappear into the night
And I'm gone

The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

[Verse 1]
Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, ya know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like ""hol' up""
""Where you from?"" I don't bang
""Where you stay?"" Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said, ""fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you""
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (I told you, nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Verse 3]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straight jacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know?
[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (haha)
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Outro]
So there you have it
But I'mma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone36Embed"

[Intro]
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C

[Verse 1]
Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?
In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Creation of man, and Columbine
You might also like[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

[Verse 2]
Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They're new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me, like ""My son's 'bout to win
Somehow, someday, and I don't care when""
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale, like an atheist
[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

[Verse 3]
I'll take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
That's my nigga, he a street nigga
Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me ""Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you""
I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T
Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
Now what you 'bout? Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah
[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

[Intro]
Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo!

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off
You might also like[Chorus 1]
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say...

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off
[Chorus 2]
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

[Verse 3]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep
[Chorus 3]
'Cause everytime y'all come around
Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
Keep it running, Ali
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

[Outro]
So tell 'em, ""Shut the fuck up!""
Tell 'em, ""Shut the fuck up!""
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
Tell 'em ""Shut the fuck up!""
Tell 'em ""Shut the fuck up!""
Yeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You thirsty, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you weak
You weak, yo’ bitch weak
Yo- (laughs)
You boo-boo, you T (laughs)
Keep all that

[Interlude]
What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
You don’t have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion76Embed"

My nigga, what it look like?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin', no cure
Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty-stricken, police brutality
Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, Botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack, then invested amongst us Blacks, just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction, no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu, then blap-blap-blap
Adolescents go cuckoo, mothers are boo-hoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'

That's exactly what Hell look like

Watching Martin on TBS as it was tedious
For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
And come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folger's holsters
By my waistline, shot for your heart
And you called it a hate crime, say you want me back
And your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit

I upped and walked out, now she crying 'cause
She need me, I got that Jon Brion love
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
My heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking 'bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't cop the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say, ""Yep,"" smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me
She need me, she need me
She need me, she need me
I would say ""Yes,"" smiling so freely
That was back then, I bet she still need me

Sit still, and close your eyes (Smoke to it)
What's behind the other door, oh
No more silence (No more silence)
Don't kill this thing we got called love (Don't shoot)
Just searching for the perfect shot

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to write rhymes, all day and all night
While you were playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscious only knew whats half tight
At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
This is a dog's fight, my nigga
The soundtrack to life, my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
That's because that's these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers
The good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome
Where is the love?

When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling (Where is the love?), don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Give me rings, give me chains, mane
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some land, or maybe I'll land a, G5
Clearport, say hello to the man
Give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
My name 'til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
Manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar, this is me
And that's love

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Intro]
For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
Gimme that beat fool, this a full time jack
No really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag
And the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large
Matter fact where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one
I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart
From the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
It's a legitimate reason why
I put on repeat Kanye's ""Touch the Sky""
But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Y'all married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something, this the shit you recite
This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean war like that!
Yeah, straight like that
You might also like[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

[Verse 2]
In 2010, I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul
I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies... homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said
""Just do you, nigga!"" Show and prove, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure
'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!""
I ain't tripping I'm just tipping on fo-fo's
Back in the city and tipping on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold, he's sick con, slick on
Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh
Straight like that

[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)
[Verse 3]
Why y'all complain about OG's?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube
I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself
Like a self made nigga, I don't need a maid, nigga
Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger
But do I need 'em though?, I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost
""Me Against The World"" on you mothafuckas
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talking 'bout? I look at your Audemars
To put ya'll in time out, it's time to unveil the real
And your career is about as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh
Just like that

[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)12Embed"

Oh what up, ho? Oh, what up?
I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
Well, alright

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louis's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin
Maintaining my modest, modest as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So what's up, baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills
Credit card late fees, Capital One popping up on my caller ID
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear
You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies cause then they'll be on it
See I know when the harsh reality take its toll
Open up your contacts then scroll
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, whats up daddy
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright

I'm going through something with life

Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Welcome to my diary, hmm.. where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtle neck
Convertibles with turbojets, fueled by 7-Up and prometh'
I feel like deaths around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot, Tequila hit me like a nina
My sky's gray, my bitches brighter
Always saying lights please, J. Cole's her ghost writer
And I'm the God MC, join my diocese
Free your mind, don't mind society
And finally, everyone got their own problems
Everything is subject to change like broken dollars
I'ma drown in my drink and swim in my woman's vagina
Like a piranha fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright

One time, reporting live, Compton, California
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that’ll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she’s compatible, she’s independent
She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me

[Chorus: JaVonté]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me

We lose touch, separated, years pass, I’m outdated
She’s dating one of Hollywood’s famous entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot ‘em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually it’ll come to pass, and she’ll need me
I need her, we need we

See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here

It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

[Verse 1]
I used to wanna rap like JAY-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
Of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard
You might also like[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Verse 2]
What up DZYNE? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I was wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard
[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Verse 3]
So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays
Like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a Black one
With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh
[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep

Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
501s, Louis letterman jacket
Little brother only 5, momma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
That every section 8 tenant is familiar with
Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
You got 80 sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers
That was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A million bucks, and that's why

I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
""Stay strong, keep your faith in God,"" what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't recieved any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine

Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long
Haven't seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life
I can only imagine
That's fucked up
I can only imagine, Uncle Bob

Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
The state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
That's what I call it, it's full of shit
A toilet can help quick, the government help?
No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah
It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care? No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
We're being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told

I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, ""What is my purpose?""
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, ""The Devil is a lie, make a better choice""
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, ""Is there really a God?""
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is

Boarding completed
I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally

[Verse 1]
Uh, comin' down like I'm uphill
Hoggin' both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter 'cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas beggin' for attention, doin' extra-extra
Downgradin' yourself, you get an F for effort
Haha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious, hit Twitter lookin' me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speedin' on the 1-0-5 'til the fuckin' badge come

Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee

I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey, lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way, lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face, lil' mama?
Embarrassin' yourself, get off the stage, lil' Mama
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga
Courtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge

Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smokin'
On some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet jumpin', the sawed-off pumpin'
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan?
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain comin'
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothin'
[Chorus]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy, man, I always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby, open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this

Sometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie
Sometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride
Sometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe
Sometimes I wwanna bump Tribe and zone out
This song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside
When my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We killed the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much
If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
It's not about the right price but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw
The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? Then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Pickin' cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are farther you from the white man's home
Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity, they parted our families
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
Four-hundred years of nothin', four-hundred years of sufferin'
Four-hundred years of tears and tribulations, miseducation
See what we facin' is now comin' back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
Called us niggers and figured that we'd never live in pursuit
Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
About a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me
She still bad though and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We fillin' up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to twenty-sixes after ridin' Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensate for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
Slaves
You might also like[Outro]
I said the four-hundred years we never had nothin'
Barely had clothes on our back
Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over exaggerate on our livin' expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercin'
You're a vanity slave
If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it
And on the back of the window it says, ""Get on my level, ho""
You're a vanity slave
We all vanity slaves
So with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here, hey, Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah, nigga, you know the first of the month, checks comin' in
I'm tryna get some

But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch now, thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
Instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here9Embed"

Reporting live from Compton, California
North Cackalack

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody just bow to the greatness or die in the matrix
You're hereby datin', my destiny's waitin'
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist
It's arthritis from holdin' it down, bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy takin' overt
He world with the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
Whose lyrics out of the orbit
More than the hardest rapper to hit the market
And market myself as a shootin' target
With offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lyin'
Be sure to befriend 'cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holdin' a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
Transmission slippin', but I ain't trippin', swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window down
Like Stacie homie when airing out indo'
I wish a nigga would

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was gettin' tired
Now I'm brushin' off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turnin' into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime takin' over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
Off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm gettin' drunk same time every year
To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Rapper Big Pooh]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I gotta be a prophet
I gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I gotta represent the
City like a District Attorney beatin' the case for killers
Might walk around in a gurney, this is my sickest winter
Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers
U-P-S, I deliver
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna put rest to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngin', this that real Hip–
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop

Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up

Just let me be me (Hey)
That's the only way I know (Only way I know)
Just let me be me (Hey, hey)
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
Yes

And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Still face, play me short like an oompa loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killers man, people who killed men
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film, man
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
Cause they know that they don't know Kendrick fo' sho
And oh
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photobook to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killas, chasing hits
Lying to yourself, all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My Mama said, ""Boy, that don't sound like you.""
I said, ""This is the sound, though.""
My only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life, to mix it up in a blender
To make sure that you feel me
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me (Hey, hey)
That's the only way I know (Only way I know)
Just let me be me (Hey, hey)
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to wanna be the messiah of Rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be frontin'
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is, ""Will the radio care?""
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was 16 years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
22, like the smallest of guns that you know
Most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show
But I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn as soon as my records spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focused, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar, and soon ya'll know Cloud 9, ya'll
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word, righteous
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word

[Outro: Female Voice]
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word

Too focused, too focused, one word11Embed"

I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
Because it will reveal to you why it is true
That whatever the mind can conceive and believe
The mind can achieve
Regardless of how many times you may have failed in the past
Or how off day your aims and hopes may be

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Go getter with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Havin' the world's best to call me the best?
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
When she wearin' a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates
You might also like[Chorus 1: Ash Riser]
In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Havin' the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin'
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin'
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area or carry the birds to VA
Let the Clipse distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks flip three to six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
Donald, that is
[Chorus 2: Ash Riser & Kendrick Lamar]
In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
(And when I do I do it again
Then I go back
When I do I do it again
Then I go back
Thug it out)
Go out and get it
(But for now I'ma go head and doug it out
I gotta rhyme, rhyme)
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get to get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and my wife
Pops engine in this old school run tight
But as you listenin' to K-D-O-T
Man, me and my girl split the bucket of KFC
She listenin' to Drake and all I can say is ""Damn
These niggas that much better than me, baby?""
I don't think this is meant to be
Cause I'm always losin' self esteem
She paused the iPhone then said, ""Huh?""
I repeated what I said then she replied, ""Shut up""
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doin' it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success, I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Risin' to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way

Tell Maestro I need to fuck over his beat real quick
Hear me?

I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9

[Verse 1]
That's no lie, ho
Rappers out they mothafucking minds so I gotta go
Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face
Got the banger in my hand and I'm out to poke your face
.38 Special, grab it, let him have it, where the safe, we hungry
Housing authority saved my Section 8
My section be on the west side of Compton Cali, champ
Where them killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp
Let a rapper tell me I ain't better than whoever's out
I'ma knock 'em out his Force 1's once I air 'em out
Air jets flying 'cross the atlas, I made it momma, made a promise
Married to hip hop, and the maid of honor gonna be R&B
I'm fucking her too, so please hand me my condoms
Where the honeymoon in the mother fucking booth
You're fucking right, I'm the fucking truth
I put my hand on The Bible
Swear to god if I lie, then I'll probably die tomorrow
Tell my momma don't feel sorrow, 'cause her son was a gunner
They found my corpse with a rapper's head in my stomach
I'm right here, I ain't running even if the Iraqis w-was in back of me
Back against the wall I'm clapping them rapidly y'all
Would never stop what you can't see
It's like a red light when driving with Stevie
Wonder if you can understand or withstand the blast of my wrath
I steer the game with both hands while you crash
Like Earnhardt my heart to the fallen soldiers
You can either ride, or get rolled over
Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma
So please chill out before you meet the coldest
Starving every day, see my face where the bowl is
Bowl on my face, I walk while my mouth hold it

And I got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana
Jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5
Motherfuck that my sweet 16's be equivalent to about 15 pie
I was 14 when I wrote a rhyme
All I seen was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line
All these 12 bars in my verses, that's what Notorious and Pac arrived
God dammit I spit just like a Mac 11 every time
I drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine
I intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9
Straight up, fuck around and get ate up
Cut 'em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days you'll know I go for

87 baby 87 Cudi screamin' out ""Fuck the police""
Bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat
Get your top peeled back, don't chitter-chat, don't speak of me
I move low-key, I think like a double OG
Inside of an old school bumpin' oldies
So high off life, that bitch I could OD
Die twice, and come back the same nigga
Lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga
Before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga
Me propane niggas for their dividends
Fuck if you innocent, Compton, all of my uncles wore Pendletons
West Coast rider, bitch, I'mma ride her
'Til the wheels fall off, buy more tires
Mmm, say hello to the new prince
I'm high king behind black tint
Na'mean?

Cookin' up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Get the fuck out of my business
'Cause I've been handling the fuck out of my business
Grinding got perfect attendance
Flyer than first-class and detention
Uh, been a winner since the beginning
And my records show, not even in the Guinness
What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started
But you're on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, new born baby? and it's my party
And I'm kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrarri
Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope?
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
Open for criticism, but really is it any room for criticism?
When this shit is in 'em is deeper than your pool, so I swim in toilets
Bitch, I be and I been ballin'
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin' up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Mmm, fuck 'em all, kill 'em all off
Send 'em off to the holy one
Put a hole in one, like miniature golf
Price on your head, and they trying to purchase
No matter the cost
Hand over the cloth
Cloth over the gun
Gun over your jaw
Bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung
Every time I get a chance to come over, I overcome
Over the snare drums
They say, ""Who fucking with you if you the god MC?""
I tell 'em nun
Get it? I tell 'em nun
Catholic nor Christian, holding the Book of Psalms
In the back of my True Religions
Never passed the bar but
I ain't got to study law
Just to judge lyrics
Mmm, I should be the judge of lyrics
Bang the gavel, give you a life sentence
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin' up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know

[Intro]
(Top Dawg, Money GANG)
Owwww, Dave, I see you, now see me

[Verse 1]
Look, I say I'm a millionaire
I'm a Top Dawg millia- no let me just come in unorthodox
I order plenty ammunition for the enemies that I got
I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards
Stomping on em' like a Kappa
Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
So where do I go now
Swear there is no-nothing after
I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC
And you don't want to get caught in the rapture
I would probably burn your whole colony
Chew you up then spit you out
You nothing but a Polla Seed
Follow hood policies
Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be
You never seen a killer til' you seen one on side of me
That green on the side of me
Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like a sodomy
Fuck them bitches properly
I do it
I do it, done it, run it like I grown legs by the hundreds
My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
Bummy, NEVER
Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bomb on whoever
Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
I steered right through your fan base every time
Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways
I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave
Sasquatch is back, but what y'all really didn’t know is sasquatch can rap
You might also like[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm iller

[Verse 2]
Ok, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track
The people like ""What the fuck happened and where Wayne be at?""
There's some boy named K Dot and he's a maniac!
I think his vocals is strapped, with a toolie, in fact
He spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat
He just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back
I think that boy from Iraq, I think y'all boys better know that
He got it on lock like a Low Jack
Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where y'all came from
Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker
Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
On sight motherfucker, sight motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
When I go pop, pop
Open up, close shop like a retail spot
Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
Bitch that's no lie, let the truth be told
K Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up

Whoo Ha!
Backpack raps with gats in it
Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
K-Dot thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier, on point like a pyramid
A forced to be reckoned with, fuck with the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
This is it, I'm in the lab cooking up all day
Fuck 'em up all day like a nympho
I been dope since S curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
I'm in the hood with the 17 year-olds that's on hood patrol
And they want stripes, so they shoot off bikes
And you know any moment you can lose your life
So kiss your kids and hug your wife, and what not yo
I spar with a dragon, he tried to throw a flame
But I ducked, then I stabbed him and came out the battle laughin'
That's a metaphor for any rapper who wants it
I smack 'em til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit the hotel
There's no assumptions
Cool out before I move out, hop on the 105
Do about 105 before your ass gets threw out the back seat
(There's a dead guy on the freeway)
Oh, It's not Dot? Tell the medics it's okay
A beast when the beat break
You probably think I'm dope like this the realest shit I wrote
But to me, it's a throw-away
I stare at the four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
Nice enough to throw a spear at Nas
Launch at Jay, matter fact, let me take that back
See I don't fuck with real legends in rap like you do
I'm crucial, concealed by real crips and suwoo
And they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing
You might also like[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Come again, no introduction, you know my name
Soul brother, Dueces suck the juice from my ding-a-ling
Orangutan arms banging niggas like a set
When I speak, they fucking silent like sex for the deaf
Violence, I play it like violins in the orchestra
Treat you like vitamins then spit you back out
Like a verse I had way back before I had it mapped out
Rip a page out the Almanac then cross reference when I wreck shit
I wish jaw bone fractures on all of you rappers bumping your gums
Like the measles when the record meets the needle
Heads spinning like a twelve-inch, Smoking the best Celtic
Like I shot Larry Bird, follow my word
Big Herb, Ill with it, I need a hospital gown
You need 54 cards, deal with it
You may think I'm killing it, but I'm healing it
Like a bitch in the club, Shoe game, touché
[Verse 3: Punch]
Ay yo yo, the flow potent
Who's more focused? Kick doors open
Deliver the golden opus leave with two guns smoking
It's me, the podium closing, a poet well-spoken
The gropes is most consistent with imminent penmanship
Mind-bending, co-existing with the written
Verbal assassin, Internally smashing, Spazzing on tracks
Translation, I'm disgusting in action
A lyrical glutton busting over Sounwave productions
Y'all don't want nothing, The sum of all fears
Mercury rising, I'm summer all year
I sixteen 'em to death and wish them the best
I guess that's the gift and a curse, You see my pattering
Y'all still rapping like that's what's happening
I write rhymes with fire on stone tablets
Peep the malice, I'm a monster
Ya Boy running like William Joseph Crawford

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Straight up, Don't get ate up
Put rappers in quicksand, Dot leaned on 'em like kickstands
I'm so hot, kids put me in their iPod
Even atheists play my shit and say, ""My God, Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, he's nice""
Don't compare me to them, just compare me to Mike Jordan
When I record and the verse and the chorus is ill
You can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa'
Watch I lay-up bar after bar like I'm trying to build a gate up
See me on the way up like an elevator, I'mma let you take the stairs
That metaphor meaning I'm already there (Greatness)
I'm in the booth with an apron
Cooking up shit like Martha Stewart was my bitch, Amen
Stay on the curb like a spray day tan?
Blowing herb with my nigga Herb, Fuck what you niggas heard
We the new West Coast Wu Tang bitch and I'm the best
Think less, You can suck my dick
Who from the West can kill it like us? Give me their name
Now I take 'em to the house of pain, Top Dawg headquarters

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son

In due time I'm the modern day Albert Einstein
I'm prime time like Deion
And the rest of y'all is peons
I pee on the best
Whoever you are you can step
Like a prosthetic leg
I see monsters in my head
That's why I rap with such aggression
I tear down studio sessions
Rappers scared, they walk in the booth
With a bible and a reverend
I use my mouth as a weapon
Bullets rip through your mid section
Rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
I'm a Comptown, nigga get a casket
Go against me, that'll lead to my advantage
Because I've got to eat
And for real I'm feeling kind of famished
Hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is
Show me where your fans is so they can see the real
I'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill
Me feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend
But I'm not an actor, put that in my will
Gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what I'm stressing
She want the raw so I fed her lines like Kevin
Tell 'em I'm a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot
Lear jet overlook the country like Garth Brooks
Lyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks
Like Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn
I'm not concerned about the SoundScan
Cause most of y'all is drowning
A lifeguard that's lounging
Meaning I don't worry about none of you rappers
I'm way more live
That's evil backwards
Now with that great word play
I tend to let my words play
Like children on a Saturday
It's sad to say you're not up to par
And I don't play with mini golf and sharks
Jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
Bled like Jay Rock or Big Wy
And make sure you wear a vest
Because they my family ties
Suit up
You got a three piece? I got a three piece
A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE
He backpedaling like a DB
I'm such a Martian
Call me ET

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, see, I know I can make a lot of money doing this, man
It's just the whole process that uh...
That I'm having trouble with, you know what I mean?
I know you just, pretty much, you know
Get the water boiling, and just, uh, get a jar or something like that
Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Shame on him! (what?)
Lemme put my gloves on
And my scrubs on
I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
This here is not for the children
You need parental advision
If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
First you bargain shop
Look for the priciest chickens
I recommend that you pay Jorge a visit
Got it wrapped in saran
17.5 no, drop four grand, this is LA man!
Unless it be a drought
But homie if it ain't, then it is somewhere else
Flip your hustle down south
That's a whole other story though
Back to the lesson, hope you're takin' down your footnotes, class is in session
Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam
As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
Say you'll get it baby, just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's get busy
This is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
You're probably thinkin' it's safe
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft (good)
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
The work should rise to the top
Then pour some cold water on that
That's when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
You're excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiend's appetite
This bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
How ironic...hmm
Like most of you rappers

Aw I don't believe that man
You're too professional with it man

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I'm starin' at you and you look so good
I want it in the back seat and on top of the hood
And, I would do it all day if I could
Put a lumberjack on and give you the wood
You got a man and that's understood
I got a girlfriend too, this a mutual move
So we do what grown folk do
She had a new lit candle on the table for two
A home cooked meal with the best soul food
I told her ""get on my plate, I'll just have you""
You can sit on my face after I say grace
Or I could just beat it up like I knew kung fu
We ended up in the kitchen with a sink full of dishes
Then I sat her on the stove like a pot while I hit it
She never want me to stop when I'm in it
Not even a minute until she finish
Then I don't

She works at the corner store
She is so bad, so bad, so...
I said ""my name is Soul
Store me inside your phone
We need some time alone
In our near future, future
Cause I am tryna bone
Whenever your man ain't home

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Take off your pants, baby
And come to me
We done had all this drank
We done smoked all this weed
Take off your pants
Don't be scared of me
I won't hurt you girl
I'll be your therapy

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
And when I come from out of that pussy, I smell fresh air
You lost your voice yelling, ""Pull my long ass hair!""
Had the 112 Clan
We could do it anywhere
I ask her where she want it next
She started staring at the stairs
So we did it on the stairs
And we took it upstairs
Then we came back down
When she came and she gave me
The crown that I wear, right now
Then I bounce like rubber
Just in case her man come unannounced
She send me a text message saying it was the bomb
I send her a text like back, ""Hit me when he gone
So we can continue to creep""
And now I'm in the sheets 3 days out the week
Freaks come out at night
But I'm up in the morning
And she up in the morning
So we gon' fuck in the morning
My only problem is running out of condoms
She say she on the patch, but I can't buy that
[Hook: Ab-Soul]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Knock on the door, he isn't home
She is alone, her legs so long
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
Cos I just wanna lay pipe for your info
She do tricks on the dick this is how I know
She make my whole shit disappear down her throat
And this a trip, she don't even choke
And I beat like a heart, she can feel a pulse
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat....2Embed"

I didn't want to (DJ Ill Will)
I love this beat
I love it so much, I can just listen to the instrumental
And don't rap
But I won't do that

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Light an incense for little Kendrick, little, oh, Kendrick
Determination, my drive is like a thousand convertible engines
My adrenaline pump the blood of a warrior, chump, the apprentice
Grown to be a man, 21 now, my heart in my hand
Don’t get gunned down, I’m from Compton, bitch
Fuck a 6-4, we hit the kill switch
The other day I seen my nigga Snows in the casket
Darker skin tone, you can only imagine
The type of shit we on, murdered them dumb bastards
Kill 'em inside their kitchen
And then stuffed them inside their cabinets
Death before dishonor, put that on my mama
I'mma ride till I see the promise land, that’s a promise
Llamas in the unfamiliar minivan

Chop 'em up, stop 'em up like a stuffy nose

Tuck your tail, bitch, hell is waiting on ya
While I’m praying on ya
Not on my knees though, I mean preying on ya
I gotta feed, ho, and your death is nutritious to my appetite
After I eat, you’re sure to see afterlife
Jesus Christ, forgive me for my sins
Because when you forgive me, I’m sure to sin again
I guess I’m a sinner, especially when I found out somebody killed my nigga
Nigga, does anybody killer, fuck your creed, race, or color
Son, daughter, sister, mother, brother gotta suffer
Bitch, I’m cold hearted, till my arteries freeze
Please hand me the keys to the G-ride
They outside then

[Verse 3: Punch with Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody get ready for a murder
No more further announcements
Mac-11 bouncing, the murder scene, coroner, yellow tape surrounding
Either I retaliate or find self counseling
Somebody got to die, simple mathematics
Semi-automatic, watch them niggas panic and their hearts perish
Or let's be diplomatic and less melodramatic
Everything is vanity, think Ecclesiastic
But what’s it all for, or what’s it all mean?
An eye for an eye means you and I won’t live to see
As our hearts bleed, we proceed cautiously
Shoot them niggas down consciously, that’s how

Compton most wanted, haunted by the ghost of the dead
Climbing out the casket, with a bullet in the head
All blue, all red, smothers every corner
Catch 'em while they're young like the symptoms of pneumonia
Good 'ol California, killa' California
Where the violence lives, and the peace remains homeless
Killers off the leash, at the mouth, they be foaming
Mad dog mad dog, my goonies be some mad dogs
I'm in the booth zoning
Like 28 grams, of the good yams
Fiends line up in the morning
I'm cloning, greatness
My words made of fire like I'm rhyming about satan
I could burn through some braces
If I had 'em
This is the return of the dragon
I'm not talking about, Bruce Lee
I'm talking about, true heat
And it look like you got cold feet
Step into the flame and I might rekindle your name

(laughing)

Point blank range, as I take aim, at success
Put a bullet in the brain, then one more, in the chest
I'm not thinking about no vest, that is not a factor
I rip through that like I rip through a rapper
I'm not a rapper, I am a raptor
Dinosaur climbing on, everything that I perform
Mayhem, chaos, they pray i, fall
Victim of a fight, which is a gunslinging brawl
But I'm all in all aware, that I'm rare
Like a flying saucer hovin' through the air
Kendrick don't have a spare, meaning there's
No two alike, you can bet it, and I guarantee I'm right
Like a freeway exit, I hope you get the message
Before your T-Mobile lose service
And don’t log off AIM on purpose, you nervous
Ain't you, I'm ready to spank you
Discipline the disobedient hang 'em like Willy Lynch
Don't fuck with me

Daddy mac, mac, daddy's back with a brand new bag
And I'm talking about, mo' money pussy and pistols
Students please get out your pencils
I'm about to break down the principles of the game
Don't complain because, it could be much worse
Whenever you took an L, know that, you could be taking a hearse
Ask you first, don't trust no skirt because bitches are the biggest liars
You playing with that you playing with fire

Burn (echoes)

Straight from the belly of the beast
Break it to the police
Said he put it on me
I'm a ride til my wheels fall off with a G
Ride with the P, 89 creep
On him like a ninja, you entered the warzone
Your home Get bombed on, like an iraqi, and the policy
A guerilla warfare, that nothing is fair
We playin for keeps, no food no sleep
I'm a warrior the coroner going to have to come and get him
Put him under the streets, and I guarantee
I hit 'em where it hurts, I'm a lurk where he sleeps
His alarm clock beep, I be right there
Gun then knife, dead kids, dead wife
Dead bedrock head shot, I'm a hit him twice
Then clear out the block, until there's no mo' life there
Top dawg ENT, bitch we right here
We ain't runnin'
We be gunnin'
Niggas talk alot but they don't say nothin'
Chop 'em up, slice 'em up, he a cooked onion
Shake 'em down, break 'em down, throw 'em in a dungeon
Don't wanna brawl with 5-6 hog
I'm a beast when I bark, every skyship fall
Ground shall break, part the seas and the greatest lakes
Anarchy is taking place, turn gorillas to bathing apes

And hopefully I found her

My nigga tells me 'bout this girl that he knows, oh
Said she the type of girl that I'm looking for, oh
Shout me her number and said make sure I call, oh
Got straight to the point when she picked up the phone
When she picked up the phone she said hello and I said

[Hook]
A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
A friend of mine said that you was with everything
A friend of mine said that you are good company
A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
Got good pussy baby
Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
I want it baby
Gotta have it baby
Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious

[Verse 2]

But I heard that you got the love that I want
Can you promise me that it's true what they say?

Be your number one or your ten

Then pray in the morning, then after we pray more play in the morning
Have it your way like a shoe custom made whenever you need
Or maybe like a chain of Burger King's

I truly understand
Nobody gotta know like a group of yes men
So momma don't trip
And if it goes well we can make you a flip
So what it's gon' be miss lady my clock is tickin'
So please tell me you accept my proposition
Are you gonna tell me now?
Or you need more time if you do that's fine

Got me fucked up, me don't pay for no booty
You looking for a price, bitch, I'm not no fool, G
I'm hot like Cooly, sicker than the cooties
I got all the juice, you something like a Poomby
I'm soon to be the greatest for the ages of the young
Watch the game like a raven, cravin' rappers 'til I'm numb
Novacane can't contain the pain that I brung
Bitch, I shine like a microscope bouncin' off the sun
Words bouncin' off my tongue like a damn trampoline
Hoes manicure, hemmin' up the bottom of my jeans so I kick him off
Got haters pissed off, used to have no bank
Look at my account, you see O's like Rick Ross
I drift off to the moon, martian
Use the Big Dipper as a teaspoon
Parkin' my UFO somewhere that you don't know
Welcome to the C4, you see one, you see four
Bombs in my peak hold, bombs over Baghdad
Son you niggas, you can never say I was a bad dad
Run you nigga like a marathon

Being broke is childish and most of these rappers teething
Still whipping the stick-shift, bottles pop, big sips

Start to thinking that I'm the best, just sort of speaking
More than decent, and fucking something that's Puerto Rican

Getting every dollar, I'm steady stacking my cheddar
Hard as ever, y'all cats soft as a feather
Super clever, outdoing me? Nigga never
Try to fuck me out my cash, dawg I'm no pussy
Got big cajones, my nigga you can't douche me

Coming in wild, with 32 guns, and 10 guys, 3 Puerto Rican bitches, and a couple of 9s
Shit, BO never stopping, cause the flow is a headache, and my swag is a Oxycotin
It's Top Dawg money gang, 20 grand verte chain
Bentley GT, 3 pieces, nigga fuck a raise
Hustle like I'm broke man, advise you to do the same
Nigga rob me? Better knock it off man
Shit, these niggas teddy bear soft
They pull up to new coupe, watch me fucking knock their top off
Bone marrow falling off, Mr. Swag dance, still lean, to the left, when they taking my pants
Try to play this MC like he was light, cause you can get it worse than Harold did at that red light
Pimping 24/7 like the day to the night
Now you mad cause your girlfriend giving head right

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to the C4
I got the bombs and the rental
Meet me on Central, and Rosecrans
Goddamn, I'm the man, for life
The left coast, bitch get it right
Welcome to the C4, got the bombs and the rental

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Moving through the block like a centipede
No rooftop, who hot? I'mma show them where the antifreeze
I hit the dealership, and tell them hand me keys, like a grand pianist
Damage anything said, then landing on top of your bitch, oops I tripped
I'm clumsy like Michelle Williams, or Jaleel White
I feel like a Predator, and none of you Danny Glovers are ready for, Alien tactics
The god is back, they're on their knees praying like a mantis
As I perform like Santa Clause
Pause TVs in the Phantom
Bitches on my left and my right like I pant them
Dancing on the coast, emerging from the smoke
Pimping in my blood, tell doc to check my pulse
They knew that was K.Dot the gemini, with another cut like a Samurai
Anything else is uncivilized

Yeah
How I sound out there, Ali?
Good? Then good

[Verse 1]
Hehe, can I pay my past a visit?
Centennial Compton School District
And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
Every time we rode up we was unsober
And everybody had know that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
Which was really dumb because where we was at
Was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didn't like that
Didn't have no burner so if they would shot us we never really could shoot back
Could've lost our life over hood rats
We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
That the black car didn't pull up and ask, Where y'all niggas from""
I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch
She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro, but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6
But anyway she was one of those hoes in high school with the cornrows
Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin
He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that's who she would get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had ask, "" Do ya got a man?""
She said,""No"", he said, ""Oh yeah
Where do you stay?"" She said, "" Rosecrans""
Rosecrans and what? She said, ""Don't matter just know I fuck
He said, ""What? you're a, you're a little freaky bitch huh?""
She said, ""Yeah, daddy, I can you get you sprung
I can work that pussy and the tongue
If you come over, I can make you cum
If you come over make sure that you bring drink
Because I like to get to drunk.""
And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived
Notice that he was out of bounds
But didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
Oldies playing in the background
Let's get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh!
Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with
You might also like[Hook]
And that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
Get your ass killed bitch! How?
Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead

[Verse 2]
Look. I guess we all can learn from mistakes
But your first mistake, might be your death date
And death doesn't wait, on no one
A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
When he went to first get put on the hood
He wasn't born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good
But usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
Tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless
His momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
The OG's that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
And the funny thing about it he thought he was bout it like P-Miller
But he wasn't no killa
Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, ""Where are you from?"" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
Never pull out if you don't use it
Even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit
[Hook]
And that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How?
Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead

When I get up all in ya
Tell your girlfriend I beat it up
So she can tell her friend I beat it up
So I can get some fame, about my pipe game
And slang my wee wee wee
Wee wee wee

Like a pornstar
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee

Now they know who I are

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I was in high school
Met this little bad bitch
She had all the Jordan shoes
Hair in a ponytail
Earrings bamboo
I said no disrespect
Girl I want a sample
She said, “You don’t know me yet”
I said, “What that got to do with it”
One week or nine months I’m still gon’ hit it
Now admit it, you’re tempted, temptation is a motherfucker
Now let your guard down
I just wanna fuck you
I’m hard right now
I put that on me
She giggled and said, “I’m full of curiosity""
Well you know curiosity killed the cat
So as we walk home from school show me where you live at
Walked in, put the rubber on, then I killed that
Walked out, she hopped on the phone, girl he did that
Hm hm
Her friend on the other end thinking how she gonna get a piece of him
Preach

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, it’s Ab-Soul
Used to fuck on my momma’s sofa
Them were the good old days but now a nigga older
I think back of when I chased that cat
Like a horny dog, nigga wet dreams and all
Waking up in cold sweat thinking bout them hoes, y’all
No holds barred I would go so hard
Sending bitches notes in class so much I hardly passed
Hoping she give me the mule yeah throw me that ass
I made her laugh
Maybe walk her home
Maybe get some dome
Like Super Bowl Sunday
And then I’m gone
Off to the next
Call her on the phone
This was before text
Carson High we was on them chicks
Let them play the good role then we make them cake mix
That’s a flip if you didn’t know
Let the homie hit though
Then she tell her girlfriend, then we let her join in

Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
As soon as the beat drop
Within two bars, you already said I'm hot
They savor, my fruits of labor
My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots
God-dammit I raised the standards of the status-quo
To go against me you gotta be more than professional
You got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection
And I be fucking all these bars
We be sexing I'm a nympho
For the instrumentals, all right, I admit it
Matter of fact I got a hot date tonight, real rap
Take this and take that from the machine
Got this money up, with no caffeine
Prepare me is Kerosene struck by a bolt of lightening
You looking at me then you're sight seeing
And what that means is that this human being is fly, don't try to duplicate
I'm authentic, I see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul
Tech! Leave 'em by the benches

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I see the future better than your computers
Apple software got the next 10 years scared I'm Fred Krueger
Rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders
Leave them dead inside the sewers
Shoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer
Burning up the very sun, the rapture
The god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster
I'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield
The 9 milli' is handheld, the AK is hands-on
Now the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb
Inside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect
If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check
Preach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if I'm lying
King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel
Because I don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Sounwave and he gives me beats by the batch

[Chorus]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
My flow cold, like Aspen
I love to show off when I'm in that Aston
Look I act a ass, but I'm not jack
A east side nigga I can get you popped at
A hundred rounds nigga stop that
You can't make that ass sit or flip-flop back
I'm too gutta nigga top that
This is lyrical homicide, not rap
So don't get it misunderstood
Say my name on your bars, shit I'm in your hood
With 45 goons 45 shugs
Chase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof
I see you big dogs, all I hear is woof
Loud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss
I'm off that bubble kush, thinking about life
Or how to make a mill and spend it all in one night
I just might...
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite
For the top dog catalog, that means everybody
Several bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers
Damn I hate rappers, don't call me that
If you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap
I don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real
Eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will
Hold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill
Four fifteens I got beat like Emmett Till
Put me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head
Tell them about the g-code, like eskimos
My arms froze, popsicle
Observing the game, I'm so official2Embed"

Can I rap a little?
Don't be mad..

Cuz I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward

[Verse 1]
Look, why I always feel that I'm hot?
Why I always feel I should drop another jewel
Like Martin on Blue Streak while you dudes get tattooed
With permanent scars, I'm always bullying y'all
I'm always righteous to think that life is what you make it
I'm always thinking of R&B bitches butt-naked
I'm always on point, like a snitch on the go
But I never snitch my car's the only thing I towed on
I'm always keeping it moving, middle finger up
Like I practice celibacy, I don't give a fuck
Just wait, I'm at they heads like a toupee yeah
It's like that, your cranium never survive titanium bars
Harder than my dick when the tip gets licked, quick
Run for cover like winter's here then listen here

Yo, why you always critiquing my shit
Why don't you hop on your own dick like Marilyn Manson
I'm dancing with 2 brains, so if I got shot in the head
I won't die I'll just lose more game, propane walking
You could sell my words at an auction for the right price
And be rich your whole life, straight up
I wanna see the world by 35 but for right now I'm Compton bound
Hit Rosecrans with a pocket full of dividends
Big truck speed through the light, run over civilians
Pimp cut bitch on my right, hat low like a stripper ass
When she hit the floor, doing my thing, why you complain?
Cause I'm young and I'm black and I rap like a nigga got a
Angel on his back, wait a minute I means business

Now that's an emcee, that's why you mad at me?

What I write is a like a bomb device, press play
And you can die tonight
Shook ones don't exist whenever that K. Dot spit
Off the chain like fast pedaling while riding a bike
I gets my ride on, you ride too
But like Scion, now that's a damn shame
I'm hogging up both lanes
Play your part, styles like Kevin Hart
They're so plain
I'm choking while I'm smoking on this strongest hocus pocus
Chocking with Punch
He sarcastic laughing cause I said that I can freestyle better than Kurupt
Now that's a statement that hopefully I can back up
See Kurupt is a legend, that's where I get my shit from
Straight lab rat, spit it once run it back
Like a punt return, they tell me wait my turn
So that's what I'mma do, lay in the cut like a 2 shot Dillinger
Killing these niggas in high pursuit waddup

[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Everybody wanna know why my game plan so strong
Cuz' I ain't gotta think with a light bulb on
Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born
""Is he really fucking with Sean?""
I reply, ""His pick, I would take a tool on.""
Dolce brown nigga, I'm right now, you ain't gotta wait later
Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player
Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other
K-Dot, definition of a young motherfucker with a problem
""Future of the West Coast"" I am
And that's real tough
Southern California, Angels, AKA LA Sharks
Make comparisons when I seen him duck
Man you think ""What was to Pac and Big, before?""
And that was before
I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore
And then I started writing with it
Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore
He don't wear the same clothes as ya'll
He is cut from a different cloth
Ya boy is cool, but I'm a different frost
Like igloo, every time I come off
Every time I take off
Pandemonium when I take off
They hanging on the wing of that G4
30,000 feet and still won't fall

Why you had to sell out that store

I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie (No lie)

[Verse 2: Kendrick]
When the lights get dark
And every body quiet, know its my part
I might start a riot
The main event
Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through shit
I never played the bench
Star Point Guard
Never pass up money, I'm a ball hog
Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin' like Ray Charles
I never had no flaws
""Ooos"" and ""Ahhs"" after every bar
Take your bitch, then give her back
For no reason for, just because, ya'll actin hard
I'm bein myself
And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
You don't want your moms thinkin' bout pullin' that hospital cord
Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure
Back seat got a flock of broads
And I ain't gotta say to kiss it, just like ""Sure""
Momma gon' clean or fix it
Use Terrific, Easter Brum????????
All it need is a little season on
Who said a veteran can't be so young?
I sound better than half ya'll on
Damn K. Dot, let me see your arm
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
Princess cut looks stupid dumb
Eyes close shut, all I see is dollar signs
And I won't get enough till I'm layed in the grave or hand cuffed up bout one time
No Lie
Blame God
[Chorus: Kendrick]
I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie (No lie)
I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie (No lie)8Embed"

I welcome y'all to boot camp
Training Day
Fasten your seatbelts

[Verse]
Who shot ya, I don't know but you're best to call a doctor
Make sure them rookie medical surgeons can oper-rate on you
Pistol whip break the face on you, shit I does it my way like Sinatra
Let them infrared's Dalmatian dot ya
Scope'll spot ya, move wrong and I got ya
Through my vision like perennial
Creepin' to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as I tippy-toe
The tip I owe is through your window pane, I'm insane
One shot could leave 'em senseless, Marlon Wayans
Psychiatrist can't restrain the mind of a sick patient
Spray everything, not a single bullet wasted
Be patient, you gon' be meeting mad links
Put 'em in the basement
BET, I'm strapped with TNT
Follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh
That's what they say when they see me in your coupe
Sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop
You tried to play big and say ""gimmie the loot""
Tables turned, now the people saying ""please don't shoot""
Get out the way, lady, and try to make it to safety
Cause I doubt that my shit is on safety
Spray niggas, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
Ride shotgun, 745 Maybe
That's Maybach for you dumb motherfuckers
I'm wise like my pops but I'm young, motherfucker
I'm the one, motherfucker, bust around hustlers
You want it? They could serve you, butler
Excuse me Ma, I ain't going for your lover
So when I fuck you, the same time I'm like ""fuck you""
You're better off looking for your next sucker
Money talks, I thought you heard Chris Tucker
I ball as if I play for the Rucker
Black Widow, keep something under my pillow to buck ya
He talk about it and when the fifth touch ya, no confession, no Usher, for real
Your whole spot is a movie like Blockbuster
If I want you imma bring it to your block, busta
And make it clap, no I'm not spliff star and busta
In fact, my niggas is linemen the way they rush ya
I keep it street from Compton to Russia
Rhyme technique is something like none other
It's warfare, choke if you scared, go buy a flashlight and pray under your covers
I slaughter niggas, one hand bang, Vince Carter niggas
Young boy I'm a father figure to kids who's minds is bigger
And they pops still sprung off the hardest liquor, I'm young
Please move in orderly fashion
For the love of money and crime I got a passion
Blow your body and spine whenever I'm blastin'
Makeover your whole face, you look like a Jackson
Any one, pick one

Good morning, America (Ahh)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
The saga continues
Good morning, America (Ahh)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A new revelation
Good morning, America (Ahh)

[Verse 1]
Good morning, America
A new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us
The letter K, D-O-T, add a space like a Microsoft keypad
You can't see me, invisible ski mask
Poke the eyes out my beanie
Ghetto Zorro on the headlines, I leave
Feces, shit on niggas, nigga
My flow come in plural
Multiple of it, majority love it
I got the masses, meaning societies, public
Low Dickie shorts, L.A. fashion still holding grudges
Ain't forgot y'all killed Pac, niggas
Ain't forgot y'all left the West Coast for dead
Tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming
Instead, we dusted off, pulled the bullet out our heads
Left a permanent scar for the whole world to recognize
California, economics, pay your taxes bitch
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast to wake up to, Nate

[Chorus]
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right

[Verse 2]
Oh, you done fucked up, baby
Young Kendrick, the grown up baby
On enough to acknowledge your fuck ups
Maybe I spare your life, maybe I won't
Maybe I give you the funk
Geroge Clinton, bring my sentence like I got a English major in it
This is higher academics, pay attention, students
Niggas, what was you foolin' with a handgun?
Might as well have a harpoon, then
I carry two or more with me like I'm carpoolin'
We mobb deep when it's beef
I don't say ""get 'em,"" I say ""move in""
S.W.A.T team so aggressive, turn a minor problem extreme
Kool-Aid red beam on top of my weapon
Notice my professionalism, I'm perfecting my craft
You niggas is half doin' your job, insubordination
I'mma have the boss get you fired
Oh, I am the boss
Get terminated, bitch
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast, don't wake up too late

[Chorus]
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right

[Verse 3]
The moral is try your best to not collide with the best of 'em
I ain't talkin' 'bout you, I talk about Jay, Nas, and Em
Crème de la crème, homie
Pockets fat, hand boney
How is that?
Kinda ironic, the West Coast, I underline it
Make him my priority, in orderly fashion, I ain't livin' in
Nobody lasted in time, nobody closing your blinds
The sun is shining, bitch
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast, don't wake up too late

[Chorus]
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right

[Outro]
My nigga, hahahaha
Roll your window down, start there
Ahahaha
See, you gotta hear the street
You gotta be snortin', you know
You gotta taste that shit, feel that
Learn that shit, brotha
Learn that shit, that shit will get you killed

Bear witness
Watch me get it in like underage club attendants
The roof go back like it's vintage
The young boy's back to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling burn
What's God willing when HOVA retired?
Now he back, guess he got some competition on his hands
Who is that? I...am...
K-Dot, I'm claustrophobic don't put me in the box with you niggas
You can't categorize me
I'm already convinced that I'm the hottest nigga out
Any comments? I thought so
You niggas is gassed up like ALCO
Scared to play Madden on All-Pro
Step your game up
I'm here to fuck up niggas' barcodes
SoundScan'll never read your albums again (whoo!)
I take 99.9% of your fans
The last one left is your moms (and she even iffy about you...)
Ain't nothing gifted about you
Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you
I'm 'bout to, send him right there, he shark food
Piranhas is coming I put beat on you rap dudes
I don't wait on you rap dudes
Nigga NASA couldn't reach my altitude
Sky's the limit, and your body ain't airborne...
Is it? Are you?

'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...

When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told Jay Rock, I like red too
But you gotta kill these niggas out the blue
They don't see it coming
Who ain't a part of the family tree
Do 'em like Paul Bunyan, axe about him
We travel like an ant colony, you can't count us
Sip Henny 'til my throat drown
New Benz, No Malice
Count money 'til our hands get calloused
40 caliber in the Cavalier, welcome to Los
Angeles, you might leave with bandages
Real life, no mannequin
You pull out, no panicking, you better shoot
Or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops
I'm talking 'bout gold bullets and black suits
No magician, no magic, POOF
Closed casket fatal attraction
Son, three hit you like John Paxson, I ain't bull-shitting
Them veterans been loved 'em
Talk about bars I got a life sentence of 'em
And I'm just like spitting cousin, ciao
No man get the best of him
[Verse 3: Punch]
The way I see, why rap?
I'm just wasting my breath
Y'all don't hear me
I'm just chasing my death
It's all over, the end's here so I'm pacing my steps
Try not to recollect what I know
These pregnant quotes meaning, they give life like semen
Be the reason my heart's bleeding
I'm coughing up blood in my palms as I recite the book of Psalms
Over a slow clap and kick drum, wis-dom
The application of your knowledge is me
Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree
Y'all don't hear me, y'all fear me like a doomsday prophet
When I'm focused, nothing under the moon can stop it
I leave you off the Earth's surface, that's what you get
For trying to test my patience like nurses
This ain't a verse this is a Kennedy curse
Put your brain on your lady's purses, you niggas crazy

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]

'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Turn that shit up, boy, bump that shit
Nigga, hold a handgun and dump that shit
Nigga, buy that borough and fuck that bitch
And kick her out before the sun come up
Nigga, my funds is up
I got my money right
Business movin' like New York City lights
Bitches all over that boy
Cause they know that young boy got a cold strut
But I don't fuck with them hood rats, they'll set you up
And I ain't goin' out just like that
I'd rather go out over a shoot-out, plow
Land of the scandalous, every corner got a candle lit
Every stop sign got a hollow tip
Every sunshine got a hood under it
And you know we Marilyn Jones runnin' that shit
My bones made out of cement, strong arm
Explode on y'all, Vietnam, boom

So, it's only right for your boy to talk shit, yuck
Straight nasty, don't walk past me
I just might grab it, just might pull a blade out and stab it
I would kill it only if you say
I'm more than willin' to take advantage
Legs to the ceilin', ho, throw away your panties
Tell 'em that we chillin' if your boyfriend harassin'

They hate, they watch, speed down the block
In a Porsche Box, stashbox, got a new Glock
In a shoot-out with anybody that you got
.45, no lie, no problem
If he got his jewels on, I'm a Black Rob him
Nigga, I'm a bad boy, I'm a black ski mask, boy
I'm a run in his house, then ask, ""Where the cash, boy?""
""Tell me where the safe or this'll be the last time
That you ever have a gun in your face""
Might be the last time that somebody run in your place
You picked a bad time to be at fuckin' home today, stupid

Guess who's back? Fresh new fitted, turned back

Nuh-uh
It's K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Who say West Coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop?
I'm 'bout to give you a prime example

[Verse 1]
Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?
Where my nickels and dimes at?
.45's Mac 10's and nines at?
9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat
If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
You wanna die? I can help you
Put the rap beef aside and [?] the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised
I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime
Mike Jordan in his heyday
Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines
I'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred
Uncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas
Grandpa moved to Mississippi
I really can't tell if dude missed me
Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe
More reason why my heart cold
Prior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio
We tryna do songs, but they ain't listen
They just kick down the door as if they have permission
Why you had to do that for?
I wish Pro Tools was on record
Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something
No assumptions, I know I'm nice
I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass
Not Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan
Chokin' the mic, releasing my frustration
Rather do that before I catch court cases
Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin'
Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
K. Dot's in my colon
That nigga, Colon Powell
Modern day war victim
Oh, I'm foul, come join my coalition
No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
Feel relentless, new apprentice
King of, comprehension
No competition
Compton's back, pump your fist like this and that
No sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts
You're a disgrace to this rap business
Just a one-man office, you need assistance
Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors
I am a senseless thug, with book smarts
And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question
We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession
Gave you the rhyme scheme before your English education
Exclamation, put it in quotes
I say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag
The flow, the artist development
Am I who gave you the growth?
You didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed
The sun shine, and now king me
The rapper's rapper, the MC's MC
Kodak moment that's been captured, cheese

This is for my mothafucking Compton babies
And all the wild blocks that drove us crazy
Dominguez Hospital born
Niggas dying fast no life insurance
Black ski mask green leaf body bag liquor poured
So much 40 oz poured it's like the curb's made of gold on the ave
Bullets got no names on it so if a girl get hit the response of it was like our bad

[Verse 2]
That's the mind of state, rap niggas meet your fate
Say hello to the hip hop's Norman Bates
I ain't even burn 'em yet
Dave Chapelle these niggas are half baked
Well done when the second first come
I have an acquired taste
I will not let not one MC go to waste
I will eat all day
I will not, cannot lose, comfortable at the top
I'm sittin' down my legs  are crossed like i had (?) shoes

[Verse 3]
I tell dude, i ain't worried about these rap dudes
They're not in my league, the West coast is me
I'm, sub-zero, I put your career on freeze
I put it on Hov like I had (Calvin Jeans)?
I'm nightmare on Elm Street, come right through your dreams and
Delete you like an unwanted movie scene
Say hello to the team, ain't ya?
You're scared ain't ya?
The world is anxious for my LP
Get pop grades, i get an A-plus, you get a D
Fucking failure!You might also like2Embed"

I'm daring one of you niggas to jump
I'ma snatch you out pistol whip you
Then put you back in the trunk
Shit, I'm back in the front
The front page of the newspaper
They say I'm seeing more paper... true
But only if you knew that
I was in your house right now taking the  paper from you
Where ya safe at?
Chick is swinging on the dick like a fucking bat
And catch it all like an umpire
I'ma go hard, rims bigger than the fucking car
Baby girl say why the fuck you even got tires?
I don't know, just get inside
And never question my shit again ho
I fold dough like a notebook
I see money, you pass it up like Magic Johnson no look

Change is coming, change is here

[Verse 1]
Holla if you hear me
In the memory of 2Pac sincerely
Been a G, since standing four feet on the monkey bars
Steal a nigga's box like it was ours
Cars roll up, Nah we don't fold up
We just hold up our guns like championship cigars
Mama hold the porch sipping OE out of a straw
I remember it all, them early Compton days
Shit, I put my all in them high school hallways
Montgomery never saw the dime bags
Finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over
Now what's over I'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage
Never came in the truck no more, we back seat
Times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance
If you're shot in the heart bleeding
Ouch

[Verse 2]
It's gutter when the sun come up
When the sun go down
Nothing but tears, no onions
Under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come
Don't go looking for it
Don't look like you hard
You're better off looking foreign, I'm warnin' ya
Before that warm temperature warmin' up
Your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners
The neighbors is listeners
I'm the future of the new west for you visitors
Never mind them other niggas
I'm talkin' in particular
Just cause you got the flu don't mean you're sick enough
I'm igloo cold with it
If California snows then I did it
The 21st of June I'll make a blizzard
The OG aim they guns at the moon
Bullets break through the atmosphere
Fear no man but God, the God of rap is here
And I can see you scared (whew)

No skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats
5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math
That's 19 hours lost, I got insomnia bad
But, I can't complain or happen to think it too much, came passion Albert Einstien gained
Had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking ?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I kick a funky friendly conversation that keep they mind racin'
You can't complain about the flow I got
I let my thoughts space out with the astronauts
Like the white boys say, ""Pass the pot""

Let me smoke for a minute...

As god as my witness, I never abuse this hip hop
I'll never pretend to be something I'm not
Giving you something to rock to other than hardcore rap, possible
You ever been under hypnosis I mean literally
Not being focused with your eyes open
They say 90% of humans don't even notice
Now can you imagine a couple of minutes passing without you knowing what happened
Without you knowing people was laughing at you
They say the worse scenario is when they have to catch you
You wake up out of your mind, your whole thoughts is baffled
You're doing things like trying to touch your shadow
Now here's some realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a gimmick
You never know until your bear witness
Bear witness...
Bear witness...

She left and you hopped in the truck, you
Took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you
Skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked
Under the seat, you headed to Long Beach
Hop on the 710 the carpool lane
Only cause you got black tint and they can't see a thing
Your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not
You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box
But one lane before you got there your car stopped

Stop

I'm still lost in my own zone in the living room
Like I'm dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
Patron shots I consume taking the pain away
Each sip bring me closer to my doom
Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind
Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time
It's passing away, the world decides, it ain't what it used to be
Everything I love don't mean what it used to mean
For example spitting a 16
No thrills, feeling numb like i'm of Thorazine
It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing
Now I'm just trying to trap cream
Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow
What you can do today, that's my new motto
With that said, I roll out the bed
Hit the showers, it's time to get this bread, now make dollars

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
Cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
So me without one is like I'm dated
I'd be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored
I'm one of the best of my Homo Sapiens
One of the best of God's creations
He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
I know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, I can feel you hating
Serving mc's like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
Half of these niggas ain't half of me
Half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain
Ten years in my career, pray to God that I don't blow up my brains Lord, I'm here
Great Depression, I don't know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost so much
(?) Usher
Either way i'm caught up in materialistic
Anything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it
Getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
No matter the crime rate I still remain content
Moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
Then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence

Real cool about it
Oil talking please
Slick with it

Wanna know what death feel like
I suggest that you stay in the house at night
The scope that I got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right
Plus my connect got a pretty good price
I could take off your neck with just one slice of the blade
No, I'm not Wesley Snipes
One cut can have her screaming out first aid
Been this way ever since first grade
Forte demeanour was to get paid
Birthday solution was to shoot straight
Thirteen I was ready for gunplay
Stand on the block taking pay
I get four shots like a freak oh he know
Not to fuck with K-D-O-T
Oh, I forgot
Never come around here without a Glock
You want beef with your boy
Nigga I put heat on your boy
Leave him tied up on the back seat

[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
We call it Blood Sport
I had to do one too, I sorry
I'm a competitor
Oh my God, it's about to get hideous
I hope you niggas know your history

[Chorus]
Homie go ask Doc (talk about me)
Homie go ask Nas (and he'll tell ya)
Homie go ask Jay (young fella)
But when you ask them all (don't be jealous)
I'm the best in LA. In LA
Or wherever the fuck that you stay

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
It's all copastetic
Hip-hop no longer face Armageddon
Call me Bruce Willis
No call me lieutenant tinted windows on the black benz
So they only see it late nights like Jay Leno
I fuck twice your girlfriend probly told you we can't fuck
No, she lying
Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
You abusing the game you defiant
Disobedient student need attention
Have parent conference I'll be there, Just let me know what classroom you in my son
I am Dwyane Wade of recording
You more like Kobe Bryant with no endorsements
That's like Shaq at the freethrow, pointless
I'm equivalent to a Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues
I suppose I handle the rock well
I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll
The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench
Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics
My team something like the retro Celtics
Which means consecutive championships
Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent
To the way I do a verse he handle the ball
The same way I handle it with no pen
I call Jay Rock when I wanna dish it off
He bang like Vince Carter when he first saw NBA Court
Alley oop the court let him do what he want
Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports
How bout football?
I run the game like Walter Payton back 1984
I'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning
Play the field like Ray Buchanan
When I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary
Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry
Hip-hop cops on me, I dodge 'em like Barry
Sanders
John Madden hold your commentary
Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion
Should I keep going?
Aw fuck it let me keep going
I'mma do it like the '97 T Owens
Not the ‘07 T Owens
T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin
Y'all need to work on y'all defense
I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend
Maneuver like Warrick Dunn
I'm just having a little fun have some with me
Let's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey
One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza
MVP of LA, call the doctor
I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something
It’s about time for halftime reporting
I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand
You ain’t nice till you play all positions
Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend
I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in
You might say, ""ouch""
Just let me score one time
Dribble my balls to the floor one time
I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan
I am the Jeff Gordon of recording
I am Tony Hawk if I was skateboarding
I am Michael Irv before the coke snortin'
Aw fuck it I’m what’s ever important
After this you gon applaud him
If not, fuck it, I’m blood-sportin'
Homie, I’m blood sport

They say that I'm the one
And you, you are the prototype
You might have the ears of sound
But you already know who they like
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I am the truth, no lie about it
Bring my testimony when I walk in that booth
Walking the thin line between love and hate, I defend mines
Join them when it comes to their crunch time, I never fold
I love pressure, that's why I apply so much on niggas thinking they better
I am a clutch shooter, I am a sharp shooter
And it's great enough to hear the butterfly moving
Follow me moving through these ghetto streets and school I say fuck a tardy sweep
Walk into school the chief right there tried to talk at me
In the midst of Piru and natty Blood beef
Shall we hesitate to walk down Palmer [?]
That 10-grade summer we had death right in front of us
Then leave the house without kissing our mamas
The new Jordans came out, but we didn't get them
The color haunt them to get too much attention
Damn it I liked it thoughs
Pac was talking 'bout the concrete rose
I never seen one till I looked in the mirror
There go, hehe, that's the flow right there
You should use it, that's what my conscience said then I hopefully abused it, huh
I am the lyrics and the music, y'all rapping note for the beat
I let the instrumentals listen to me
I listen for heat, my ears can hear fire
I pierce through the flame like barbed wire breaking up concrete
And I ain't thinking 'bout no rap beef
Niggas is getting killed throughout the week, that's every day
Catchin' bullets like an umpire
We tried to stay home but still ain't safe
That's baseball tactics, retaliation back and forth like tennis rackets, we used to it
Who can circle 'round the block the fasters
If you can do it, think you know why it becomes a practice
We worked it out like barely total
Cuz shit happens

Paint a perfect picture like I'm rhyming only scripture
I'm nice, ice water veins, it's pure no filter
Who you get your style from, it seem real familiar like I heard it before
But reincarnation is a blind man's theory
So I ain't going for it, na uh
I ain't having it, you getting to board it
Like an unfair mother, my child you gon suffer
'til you acknowledge to whom gave you life through knowledge
It's higher learning, I'm taking dudes through college
The prototype for the flows you like
I'm surgical on the mic, I cut you up somethin' nice
Get out the pocket, I'm sending them skyrockets right through your minds
Optic popping out your eye sockets, ah
Excites a riot every time I'm rhyming
In accordance with the snare I got impeccable time, Junior

That’s where you headed boy, to pine oil heaven. I'mma get that gun, and then I'mma get that money. I don’t believe you got it in you, Jake. I'mma go get it right now (gunshot) Oh shit, awwwww you motherfucker! The next one will kill you. Ohh, son of a bitch. You shot me in the ass

[Verse 1]
I never been a bitch in my life, I never ran from a fight
I was told when niggas bark you should bite
And these puppies ain’t eatin' enough Pedigree to scare something
They play with the word gangster til some lead dumpin
Until the ambulance coming pressin' on they chest
Calf and stomach, you grabbin' the hand of a woman
I never took the stand, snitched on my man and came back home Like it was nothin', actin' like I ain’t do somethin' wrong
Fuck it, and if I did i would look 'em in the face
Tell hop out that bucket and spray
Tell 'em to make sure they hit my head and my waist
Tell them to circle round the block twice in case
Shit, cement pump in my veins, hard body to the death
Scream fuck the world with a capital F
Everybody extinct, it’s just me and my niggas left
And this is how we think

[Hook]
No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me

And it’s passed on like a ritual, not sworn in it
You ain’t livin' it because you put it in sentences
And you ain’t givin' it if it’s ten percent, it gotta be a hundred
Walkin' down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it?
I got a hundred shots for any one of you blood clots
Motherfucker, we will fuck ya
Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker
I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid
We lift something out the trunk that got a kickstand with it
You either fall now or stand with it
You either crawl now or get laid down
Think about it, I’m only giving you one minute
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you’re too late

Look between my eyes
You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires
And my burner from the four fifth which is the four five
Which is that ninety-five Jordan shit
Jordans on your feet, we gon' take them shits
Put them on our feet and reshape them shits
Now don’t they look sweet?
Wear em for a minute, sell them the next week
That’s good profit, y'all ain’t thinkin' logic
You talkin' ass backwards like criss cross pockets
Mel Gibson, you just actin'
Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to target practice
Teach you niggas a lesson or two
Won’t you listen when a grown man is lecturin' you?
Cause any weapon will do in the process of fuckin' up you, nigga
You rappers ain’t built like us
Y'all just lift a lot of weights and look tough
We see through that, we shoot through anything that’s buff
And we ain’t thinkin' about handcuffs
The police runnin' from us, we so hard bodied, trust

No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war

They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, ""Fuck it, let the music be his""
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?
(Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em)
Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6"" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, ""Fuck the world"" with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop

You know what that means, I'm done with you

Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm
Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm
Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and they're looking at the charm
I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back
And the heat lay right, right, right under that
Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat
That's the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, I'm a stand up guy
I'mma pump my fist, I'mma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy
Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money
With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me
Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
100 carat, nigga I'm the golden child
Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial
Wow, I'm amazed by how you niggas talk about you're married to the game, ain't took a vow
I'll fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up
Now, I'm on some other shit, we ain't on the same page
You ain't sticking to the script
Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
Shoot up your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat
Blood or crip, I don't give a fuck bout none of that
All of y'all can get it, homeboy, it's more than rap
Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap
I rap like I got angels on my back
God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit
I don't write it
Off the top like a psychic
I kick, lyrics like Jet Li
Which produce money to put your boy on the beach
Shit, sand in my feet

Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Cus' we ain't gonna win
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen
(shit)
Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Struggle that is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
That means what I'm thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
Wait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
If dreams was reality
If it was cool for you to be a casualty
The only way that you can escape poverty
Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time
You're listening too far if you hear this part
I suggest you go back and press rewind
I fast forward to common thoughts of a human
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix
Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it
Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
Direct them to a casket
Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
If they wanna see reality [haha]
I'm losing you again ain't I?
Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
Black President, they don't wanna see that
It's evident...pain is pain
We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness
I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect
We learn to live with it I guess
I mean die with it, since we're already dead
Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time
Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
Teach you about the things that we live around
Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...

What if dreams was reality and money was love
What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity
Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity
Traveling, no direction, the aimless casualty
American dream or Scarface fantasy
Kilos of coke and the arms of black families
We use to it, our hearts draped in stone
A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back home
Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash
End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast
Now another mother screams picking out his casket
Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not
It's trigonometry (trigganometry) divided by some real life
And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice
The streets mowed him, can't make past that
It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at [ugh]
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
World trade happened on the world stage
Same stage look at us as some educated apes
On video stations women gyrating
Parading around, mind-raping the youth
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial

Yea that's right you better walk away
Go on and walk away cause I'mma burn this motherfucker down
King Kong ain't got shit on me

[Verse]
Running them ghetto streets, I ain't cooking up nothing
But I got the tea kettle on side of me, that metal on side of me
I dare you to follow me, I'm double daring you to follow me where the drama be
His momma in debt, so she can't pay the funeral fee
So wherever them candles at, that's where the funeral be
Kids don't get sleep, guns keep 'em up real late
Walk in the school, shells laying on the concrete
Take 'em to school, show and tell, for that final grade
She gave him a 'F', I say that young boy deserve a 'A'
Cause she never slept where he slept, or seen ricochet bullets rip
Through his cousin's face, ripping his face off
I aim the fifth straight, concentrate like I'm playing golf
I'm Tiger Woods with a gun in my car, I keep one in my car
And keep a bitch with implants, so she keep one in her bra, boom
Shit, make room for the lil bastard
The flyest nigga you seen on centennial campus
The eight ball tucked in my jeans while I'm getting patted down
They didn't know I had it on me, stupid security
No one securing you, if I'm gon' touch you
If I don't like you, the Mossberg pump love you
I take that back, it probably just wanna go and fuck you
Go with you, then dump you inside the coneal confortable
Defending my belt, depending on nobody but myself
Unless you talking 'bout money, I need yo help
I need some help, they say that my screws is loose
Like handlebars on mongoose, this is true
You tough rappers, I'm talking to you
He ain't on no used to shit, but you see his face grew
He say that he fabulous, but really don't have a clue
That he just a puppy living in this zoo
Shit, whoo, with that said, you should know I am the truth
The truth hurts, you should feel pain when I'm done with this verse
I'm done.... psyche, I ain't finished
Ever since the first grade, been bad with the run-on sentence
I never sat the benches in the game of life
I played the whole forty-eight minutes, Christ
I rap with precision and lyrics, is grandma nice
I'm cooking up something, you want you a slice? Then get it
I'm holding my stomach, I'm shitting, I'm farting
On any rapper thinking I'm in his vision, is you retarded?
The CL got my head spinning awkward
Bought it last month, 'bout to put it up for auction
I'm not rapping, I'm talking powerful
And for that dirty money, boy, the Mac'll shower you
The Mac disintegrate, and then devour you
The mag'll forget you, regurgitate and sour you
I world trade you niggas, north and south tower you
Steroid, my authority overpower you, the industry ain't affording me
They might as well just give me my money and start ignoring me
Cause y'all niggas boring me, y'all ain't making no dollars plus no cents
I swear, y'all niggas foreign to me, foreigners
I tell you what, go and tell it to the coroner
Killing 'em whenever my performance come
When I do it, it won't be nothing right after I'm done
When I ruin niggas' careers, put you niggas in tears
Get you pom poms, you better off, cheer for me
Shit, the new money is here for meYou might also like2Embed"

Dot]
I sit on the studio couch
Ask myself, ""what the fuck am I thinking about?""
Thinking 'bout living without the past and the present
A Dr. Dre record, imagine, I drift off, 600 seconds
10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore
K. Dot had turned Curious George
You know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for
Like what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads?
Before he turned right to get them shots through the door?
They say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic
So he'd risk his own life to get someone else killed
But in the process, get injured, it don't make sense
It's like the Da Vinci Code, trying to solve the crime of these rap souls
What if B.I.G. never did it big?
Never went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes?
Would it make my flow more persistent?
Would it raise up the bar of competition? Who knows
Who told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV?
Would the battle be less interesting if it wasn't personal?
If Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening
People thinking it's a publicity stunt
What if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow?
Hip-hop would really be fucked
Something like Milli Vanilli
Nothing different, quite similar
Filling up my mind capacity
Thinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony
What if the shooter-
Better yet, what if Malcolm on the side?
Killed two birds with one stone, both would've died
Now let's rewind

Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Imagine if Tookie was a Blood? Look, no disrespect
But would there be more Bloods than Crips sets?
Dominating the population of
L.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay?
Matter fact, imagine if we didn't really start this gangster shit
Y'all wouldn't have nothin' to spit
No drive-bys, no flags stickin' out pockets
No N.W.A. dudes, just rappin' like Cre Cru
Imagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two
Feet no paralyzed, would he be alive?
Or would he been lost his life to the streets?
No match, no cars in that driveway
What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin?
On this L.A. strip, would these rap niggas use his name?
Nah, what if rap niggas never had rap?
Would they try to fall back on this drug game?
These rappers ass backwards
Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine
But to smoke, not to slang
Imagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane
Just think about it
[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life

[Verse 3: Punch]
Imagine life without death, would you even feel alive?
Your people that passed, what if they never died?
Imagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness
Knowing her son safe, and she ain't lose him to this madness
The street living, what if the crack epidemic
Never reached the projects and destroyed our buildings?
Turned most of us to killers, innocent victims
Imagine if heroin didn't affect our system
They say drug money funding the labels today
What about the drug money that's funding the C.I.A.?
Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets
Would they start in the hood, or executive suites?
Where the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me
You could possibly live without heat
Imagine if Al Gore had won that election
Would the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected?
Imagine the penal system without witness protection
Would there be these many cowards on the stand telling?
I don't know, I'm just speaking my mind
Lost in my own soul, Just press rewind and imagine

Greetings people

Hub City's Threat, Minor of the Year, K.Dot
I know the hood's been waitin', right?
But I'ma stop being stingy
I'ma share with y'all
Uh, uh

[Verse]
Whoever thought young Kendrick would spit so ignorant?
Make street disciples go and get a membership
Streets revival like Creflo Dollar hustlin' on the strip
This is church
Advise you to purchase it or copy the worst
Y'all rhyme sloppy, I rhyme properly
I jam-pack Monopoly dollars by puttin' a hundred percent in every verse
Add ten percent more, and what do you get
A skinny nigga manipulatin' the innocent
I have no sense, ever since the Rodney King riots
Mind militant, nigga, don't try it
Try to hold the peace, for I promote violence
Y'all don't rap, y'all make a lotta noise like sirens
So I'm here to shut shit down
The four pound decorate your city, make over your town
I'm not Diddy, but still a bad boy 'til the reaper come get me
Follow me now
Where no man has stepped, no man has repped
No man can withstand all the nights I've slept
Under my sheets, no life, thinkin' 'bout death
Fuckin' with me, you just might lose your breath
I'll take you to them pearly gates, them golden streets
Plus a cute little casket where your body can sleep
The Hub City shit is me, ha

If I gotta ride (O-O-O-Okay, uh)
Then he's gonna die (O-O-O-Okay, duck, niggas)

[Interlude]
Uh (Get back)
Let me talk to 'em
Listen

[Verse]
I hope niggas ain't really tryin' to break my bones
'Cause if you are, make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone
Play hard as a rock, bullets can break stones
Break bad boys down like Jenny did Sean Combs
I'm hot as an oven, you just a pressin' comb
I'm not impressed homes, you should've stayed home
And prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin' shitted on
I gives a fuck if A&R's don't pick up the phone, huh
I swear there's no one like me
But if it is, then I got a long lost twin, or they made me a clone
I don't care about friends, I was made to be on my own
I came in this world by myself, and I'm leavin' alone
Hopefully with a crib that I can call my own
With a backyard the size of the fuckin' Georgia Dome, pop
You pop shit, then I might pop your dome
Give your homies a reason to make a memory song, huh
Niggas swear that they love when the beef is on
Knowin' that plummet time the only time he'll roam
You better hold your breath, I give you walkin' death
And recommend the gun bein' your chaperone
I know young niggas that look up to Al Capone
And they look seventeen, but I swear that their mind is grown, shit
I'm so grown and the reason why I write this way
Pac and Big be ghostwritin' my songs, huh
You can play the boss
But if you get shot from bein' on top
Then, homie, that's your loss, shit
I'm nice wit' it
I'll pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs, get it?
The niggas tryin' to get money like Fort Knox
Either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock
And you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor
Yeah, somethin' like Rick Fox, huh
You ain't a thug, homie, you just a fox
In the midst of werewolves somewhere in the Boondocks
And I'm really from the streets
So if I ask for beef, homeboy, don't bring me no pork chop
I turn your skin to pork, homie, with one chop
With a rusty switchblade that's dirty like bum socks, ha
They say the flow is crack
So wherever I rap, best believe you can call it a dope spot, bitch, bitch, I swear

One word describing him: genius
What you know about the city I live in?
Where the souls of the dead is livin'?
You don't know about our living conditions
We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
But it's more than just weed and women
Gangsters, husslers, bullet collisions
Players, pimps, who can envision?
The place where I reside where Eazy was pitchin'
Dre was 6'4 lifting, N.W.A had mention

‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
The Compton shares can't forget the police
'Cause in the hood tellin' pigs no more
It be the mark of the beast
And their main aim is just the talk of the streets
But when you see 'em please be quick on your feet
That they go, watch em!
Had you for road, kill just like a possum
You could contain 'em, but there's no way that you can stop 'em
Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
Hoping one day they blossom
The same time, hope the system don't lock 'em
'Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches, we barely got 'em
Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
We back, that's for my people, it's official
[Chorus]
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life

[Post-Chorus]
Let's bring it back
Back to the streets, of course
Yeah, uh, Compton, right, uh
Homie, homie

[Verse 3]
I don't know if he new around here
But it's good to know somebody if you're new around here
'Cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here
Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
Take New Jersey and fit it shit, whatever you don't care
It ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
But I'm amazed 'cause the young boy been here for years
I've seen niggas shed blood blood tears
Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
Introduce you to rugers
Clock you in like Tap Judah
A nightmare on my street, it's Fred Krueger where I live
Minus the actress and the producers
Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper
We get +Vapors+ like Biz Markie but still I'm used to
From Rose crest to central, Compton's Anthemia
We back, that's for my people, it's official
[Chorus]
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights

[Outro]
Uh, right, we back
Uh, I see, I see
I see it's me HUB, CID, what?
Don't ask why Compton's me, nigga
Haha, K-DOT
It's for my people on the blocks man, yeah

Yeah
You're now rockin' with the best
Hub City's threat
Minor of the year
K. Dot
Ooh, it's about to get so ugly in here
It's about to get so ugly
Like whoever's listening to this
Oh man I crack myself up
Yeah
Oh my God man, oh my God
We 'bout to shit on these faggots man
Check it
Yeah, K. Dot
(Let me get that)

[Verse]
First niggas used to rapping, get my attention
Now I don't even listen
It run through one ear and out the other
And I don't buy niggas records for music
I'm more interested in their album covers
I'm a talented brotha
Plus I move so quick it's like my brain came with a joystick
Motherfuckers better listen when I spit
I knock records out the park
Homeboy I Ken Griffey a hitch
And I might Ken Griffey ya bitch
But won't buy her shit, not even a small bag of chips
Just give her long pipe 'til it's scrapin' her hips
Like a waitress, the way the broad ask for the tip
If you want, just ask for a clip
I'll give ya those for free, no, I won't charge a fee
Just roll up on you, like cut off sleeves
Nobody can cut off the number one rap artist, damn, I am the hardest
Blowin' through Nintendo cartridges
To Maybachin it, valet parkin' it
Now people arguin' who is better?
Them or him, him referring to me
Them referring to the industry
Hands down, Jay left, now give me the crown
Fuck later, I'm takin' it now
Fuck haters, I'm takin' 'em down
With the red beam, red beam, silencer, don't holler it muffle the sound
Bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound
Straight for the dollas, 745, older Impala, scrapin' the ground
I suggest you follow, or not be smarter
Seein' another broke tomorrow
You can tell the way I speak begins to stutter
First it was hard for y'all to even makin' it harder
Ain't about money, then please don't bother
Y'all niggas funny, talkin' bout that you run shit
When I'm lookin' at ya like ""Who are ya?""
Y'all niggas is gas
And what make that bad is y'all niggas is trash
Y'all don't wanna see me spaz
Out, pull the gats out and see me blast, ouch
You better off coppin' a pen and a pad
Than copyin' the last rhymes I had
And spit 'em to your homeboys 'till they all say ""You wrote that?""
Tell 'em lies or, give 'em the facts
It don't matter 'cause in a minute, I'ma be chargin' my raps
A G for a bar, that's 3 16's, plus a 8 bar hook nigga, add up that
I charge you a verse like Dre would charge you a track
Your whole budget, hoes love it
But you hate it, 'cause I'm your girls favorite
Nigga, face it, you can't walk in my shoes nor change the sides tryna replace it
As far as rap, I spit in the Matrix
Past reality, nigga actually, I wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity (Haha, oh my God)
That's a whole 'nother planet
For real holmes, I do damage
Blow up ya city, even ya school campus
Run in ya class while your doin' ya standards
Let it blast
One gun subtractin' ya life, now that's the basics of math
You might also like[Outro]
Oh my God man let me stop spazzin' out on these niggas, B
They have to call 911, I'm done

It's real ugly, ya know?
Yeah, bang, bang, let's goEmbed"

[Verse 1]
Now listen my friends, not to offend
But this is a story told over again
So many niggas tryin' to fuck with the Ken
But the only problem is they can't win
I gets down my younging
Please turn it up just to sound my youngin
I burned it up that's your town my youngin
Either the cake or the trait bound my youngin
This the brand new trunk
Rattling, beat tackling
Big truck paddling
Dime piece beauty peagant-ing
Pick em up then they (uh) saddling
They bus travelling

With my brim kind of tilted low
So fresh oh yes it's me suppose

So a nigga gotta move kinda low

Big truck fit five chicks at a time
Stones big enough you can go rock climb
Put that on somethin'
Nah man I was lying
But tell me what you know about it, know about it
Fat camp I can't go without it, go without it
This ain't hot, I truly doubt it
Mapped out the whole game so reroute it
‘Cause look here boo you fucking with a champion

Bring it on you busters, watch you niggas flee
He's making a killing off putting his life on Pro Tools
The new school, the rap version of Aaron Jones
The hair and bones
To rock Jane, to cocaine, to spit game
To get us, they get tucked
Nigga don't get gassed up, might get blast up
It ain't about being tough, but even in them interviews
Every time you see me got a semi in the tuck

Turn around and give the glove
So I learn to stay with you
Cause when your wheels look like Terminator 2
It'll turn your man into a hater, true
Hopefully the pain will stay past then

Uh
Who's sick as me?
Tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real
And as far as my eyes can see
I'm the only one fucking with me
Myself, so put your album right back on the shelf
And let real business get dealt
You ladies man like Leon Phelps
I pee on any man tryna discontinue my health
I don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt
Your small mercy won't help
When shots circle around your waist like designer belts
I design your face, the tray hitch lift ya up
Rock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy
What you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?
It's right here, and y'all catch up, I move fast like light years
Now it's back to the basics
K. Dot's nothing to play with
A nigga tried to test my gangsta
I pulled out a weapon and aced it
My grade point average at the top of the brackets
I'm sick like a cancer patient
Assist many players like personal agent
Y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance
I'm the best now
Plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows
Sit down, practice your verbs and nouns
'Cause I'm on the verge to progressin' my words
I'm the best you heard today, hands down
So hand down whatever you had
Like you been in a bag
Put it in garbage or trash, I'm the best you had
Ever since, oh yeah, intelligence

For my niggas that hate the fights
Get it with the Glocks

For my niggas that hustle nights
Bakin' with the pots
Bakin' with the pots
Bakin' with the pots
For my niggas that know right
K-Dot is hot

See my game still the same, never trick on a bitch (Ugh)
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm a nice dude (Okay), livin' my life dude (Ugh)
Trick on a dumb bitch is nothin' I might do (Nope)
Some try to play fools, the shots that they fake shoot
I'm mean like a Red Bull is mean when the eighth pull
I'm faithful to whatever I stand for
It means dough, gettin' my pesos
Gecko or Geico, whatever it stand for (Ha)
Red and blue flags, yours are like a rainbow, ha
Pants hang low
Born with the best flow since LL was rockin' a Kangol (Woo)
'87, one man, eighty weapons
I go hard without usin' protection
Hard out, learn your lesson
When I pull out, make like R. Kelly, get to steppin', haha
I'm the best at this profession
I can't help but bring it back to the essence mothafuckas

[Verse 2: Dave Free]
I'm a young dude, smoke the best weed
See the act right, see them dubs clean
A sexy bachelor, hit 'em in your strokes
Never bust a nigga, goin' down your throat
The Phantom, not rich enough to cop yet
But picture [?] for the niggas outta pocket
I can exercise you, you can get a [?]
When I lean back, don't dance, give me hizzead
Killer got that heat, we know killers in the street
With the heat that make you feel like a fat boy at the beach
So don't try to run up on [?] talkin' all that Simon and shit
I can rhyme and shit
If you niggas pay attention, you won't ask me shit
You should think about it, take a second, one
Matter of fact, you should take four b
Think before you fuck with real killers in the street

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm from a small city, no pity shown 'cept hammers thrown
Quickly push back your dome like a hot comb
So swiftly, come get me
If I had every bitch in the world, boy, you still ain't fuckin' with me
I'm 'bout my money strictly, as long as I stack my banks up
I'll have enough Young Bucks to fuck with 50
Now who fuckin' with me? Me and that gun was born siamese twins
So where I move, it's comin' with me
You down right, play with me, think I won't take your life
The scope'll have more dots on you than a website
I'm 'bout my head right and yours left
I swear in the vocal booth is where I'll take my last breath
That's K-Dot, oh you ain't heard? Shit, that boy hot
With dime bitches runnin' on beaches like baywatch
You sit and watch the young child with my money stacks
Add up faster than cell phones on speed dial
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
For my niggas that hate the fights
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
For my niggas that hustle nights
Bakin' with the pots

Uh
I see everybody wanna play gangsta now, huh?
Well you know what, niggas?
I'ma just play Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Feel this, uh
Let me shit on these niggas, man

[Verse 1]
Look, homie, I'm not your crip or your blood
Homie, I'm just Kendrick
See me other than him, might plead the fifth amendment
Hard headed nigga, shit, all it take is an instant
Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
Say you bust your guns, but never totin' it
You say your man is dope? I think he's smokin' it, homie
Why you provokin' it? Don't mean to boast a bit
But you can call me a fly 'cause your boy be on some shit
Plus I'm fly so all the girlies think I'm the shit
I got it to spend but still never buy 'em shit
You better guard your bitch
'Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on, holmes
Somethin' like a light switch
Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag' for the Porsche
'Cause it got a better steering grip
Young but been a man and you won't understand
Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceilin' fan
You might also like[Chorus]
When the beef start cookin'
And the shots start comin'
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start lookin'
And people start runnin'
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got a heat up in them Dickie pants
I got some plans to stack riches
Own 76′s like a Philadelphian
If you don't know by now I'm focused like camera lens
And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
'Cause I don't wanna hurt you, have 'em runnin' in Herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
Been a artist since Prince played in Color Purple
Weed smoke, hydro blow on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
I suspend you, they 'urk you, what you lyin' for?
You know you ain't eatin' like feed the children commercials
Man, my children'll circle around your block
Let out shots and be home thirty minutes before they curfew
[Chorus]
When the beef start cookin'
And the shots start comin'
Don't hesitate to pop that thing (Right)
People start lookin'
And people start runnin'
Don't hesitate to pop that thing (Yeah)
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned (Damn)
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me (Bitch)

[Outro]
Yeah, it's real
Kendrick
You see me in the streets man, come to me as a man, man
It's real, nigga
Kendrick, you gotta respect it, niggas respect me, man (K. Dot)
Stop being some yank, nigga, it's real
Lotta niggas tryna play gangsta, huh?
It's 2004, man, you wanna be in this shit, quit it
Be yourself, man
Still affiliated, huh?
Niggas respect me, bitch10Embed"
