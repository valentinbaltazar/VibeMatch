Swallow, girl, it's just nut, haha
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass
Yeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gaggin' in the back of the cab and
Camp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge
(Hodgy, pass me my inhaler, fuck!)
I'm sick of hackin' and coughin', I'm often this fuckin' awesome
I'm animals, Noah's Arking, all from this rapping' nonsense
Four stories in my home like ""What the fuck's an apartment?"" (Nigga?)
Get shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty
And take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience
Oh, you want a tip, bitch? Well, here's my dick for grati-tur-ity

I can smell the whore on a bitch when she flocks around my crew to flirt
It's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse! I'm ill, I used this earth to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to
Skip to my Lou, get hip to the pew

Knock-knock, mothafucks, it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga, fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out in Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called ""Pink Dolphin""
I roll here on a mean unicorn

Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about (RIP)
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ayy?
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay

And you was down for the weekend, I was down for the greetings
And you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first official date so I was stuck, like
It was past curfew, and we was at the Grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something
All I remember was your motherfucking face

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I’m holding your hand and
Making eye contact, I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
I'm insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
'Cause holding your fingertips is golden

Venues are like pussy with me, ""Should he come?""
I'ma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, um, that mac and cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics (""How's your dick?"") Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee (Damn)
I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touch a bag of weed (Word?)
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, ayy
Getting T.U., O.F., indeed
We was missing Sweatshirt, like ""Where's the hooded sleeve?""
Okay, never mind, we found him, yeah

Crack fucked up the world
And I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era
Who made a lot of money off that shit
And I wonder if it fucked with they conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from

[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
Forty-eight, forty-eight, forty-eight states I get it in (Nigga)
Forty-eight, forty-eight, forty-eight states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
Forty-eight, forty-eight, forty-eight states I get it in (Nigga)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Shit's getting warmer, on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother's a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you're accustomed what you're used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating, I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it's all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
You can, blame me, motherfucker
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tucked
Didn't realize this game fucked, up some lives
Oh, how's mine?
My conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that, I'm fine
I got a little money in my pocket

She could have been a doctor, nigga, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
Could have been an actor and won that Oscar, said I'm sorry
I sold that soap, and I killed black folk, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my mama all cool, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)

You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it

Even more than the money, it's just your job (I'm sorry)
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person (I'm sorry)
And to do this and do that
You become the go to guy, you know, forever
Next thing you know you're in too deep
Way too deep, it'll scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize, man, we gotta get out of that, man

Went to Six Flags, six fags came up
And said ""Ayo! Can we get a pic?"" I said no
And they said ""Oh! It's Wolf Gang, ""Yonkers"", Goblin is my shit though""
Now I'm like, ""fuck, I don't want to be an asshole""
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, ""Hey, Tyler, can I...?""
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
""But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard ""Radicals,"" the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song ""Bastard"" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, ""Fuck, is he speaking to me?""
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to ""In Search Of..."" and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like ""fuck""
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a ""hey"" (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play ""VCR""
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...""
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
""Yonkers"" and ""Yonkers"" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about ""Yonkers""
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
""Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say ""Sagan Lockhart"" and when you came out to ""Sandwitches""
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started""

All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it

I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled

Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'

Geek, fag, stupid loser, find a rope to hang
I'm not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names
I wanna tell my pops but, shit, he'll probably say the same
Fuck...
Hated by everyone, that's the way it seems
I don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self-esteem
I sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone
'Cause none of the cool kids would let me join a team
Depression's on the stalk again
My best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck
'Cause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see I know better than to show my face
Around them, but the day I do, it'll be everywhere
When I share these feelings finally, they gon' fucking care

Murder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you
Was when I... (""Uh"") with all them burners, you
Think that I'm some punk bullied bitch who ain't gon' trouble you
Well, I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you don't mind
Umm ""Who are you again?"" I'm Samuel and that's Tyler
We came to get wild and style in these trench coats!
Don't start asking what's packing in these trench coats!
Just know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats! (""Umm"")
My step-father called me a fag
I'll show him a fag, and I'll light a fire up in his ass
And recently, them assholes been fucking with me in class
So I'ma keep them muhfuckers there and make sure they pass, huh
My prom date, she dismissed my offer
So I'ma **** her and toss her in the principal's office (Tyler, I'll go with you)
Oh, now you wanna conversate with me, try to be my friend?

We are the Sams, and we're dead—it's just four of us
We come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious
We took their heads, but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours...

[Verse 3]
Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid, but I'm growing up, so they're missing
I didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army
I'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me
Mama, I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?
I don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home
And I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
And I... I hear helicopters, make 'em dip
I'm fucking reloaded, I told you all that I ain't taking shit
You better back up before this Mac start to lift up
I'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
The difference between us and our class is tan khakis
I got ninety-nine problems and all of them's being happy37Embed"

Tall ugly nigga with lips bigger than Tigger
Only blue print on these Vans like I don't listen to Jigger (Uhh)
Cotton-picking nigga, Golf Wang season sicker than the block
Colette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em (Uhh)
Workshop is awesome, ask Dill and let's pretend
Like I'm not making dollar Bill Withers on these fucking stickers (Uhm)
Pulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck
Bitch, cut the crap like dyke booty when they scissor (Uhh)
Pink haired Mrs., I'm her mister, sipping Slurpees, bag of chips
Now show your tits for mister Fuji, take a picture (Uhh)
OF is popping like a blister, need some Listerine
Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister (Uhh)
Sick of being black, sipping paint thinner out a tin flask
Plotting on the babysitter before dinner
And hopefully I get her, if I don't, fuck it then
See I never simp son, polar opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch

I'm like goals, those are something you have to stand to reach
My campaign speech elect me Commander in Chief
Respect to whoever's minor appearances cause mass hysteria
But I'm still incomparable, I'm like the face of America
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold
I'm a fucking centerfold, I'm something to behold
I can kill a hundred shows, take one for the road
I'm results of putting persistent pressure on coals, (Bitch)

""I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world-famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!""
[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, ""Fuck shit""
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, ""Hi,"" I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the ""Tron Cat"" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck

Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum

She thinks you're getting cash, no, bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait, turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nig​ger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned

Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing (Uh)
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a Bimmer, E46
Have you heard ""48""? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do, I go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease, bitch!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down, I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare
On the same damn bus like, ""You're going to jail now""
[Chorus: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty?
Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck? Bitch, suck dick
Motherfuck' you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I'm a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I'm badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos
[Chorus: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Why y'all so salty?
Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well, if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me
Tryna set mood, little RedTube, fuck lotion
I don't need lube, dry fist suits me (Yeah)
Up and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound
The shit's kind of disgusting, fap time
And before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, like—

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Christian Clancy]
Oh, shit, aw, fuck
What the fuck?
Aw, I'm sorry
Is that my shirt?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I just wanted some bangs

So, what's going on, Wolf?
Talk to me, man
People worry, we hearing stories about you getting into fights and all this unnecessary bullshit
It's—Wh—What's on your mind? Talk to me, I'm here

[Hook]
Domo, roll another one
I'm just fuckin' with you, I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun (Wolf Gang, nigga)
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds (This nigga paid)
Mama got the Rover with the Range (Yeah)
She don't ever, ever gotta struggle, not again (Wolf Gang, nigga)
And I put that on my dead grandmama's name (Rest in peace)
Too soon (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Uh, my nigga Slater, yeah, that's my little pony
Little homies is repping like I been fucking with Kony
Nigga, Phillip and Kobi, to my niggas that know me
Your boy seem happy as fuck, but truthfully, your boy lonely
Nigga's a target for marketing, he's an artist
Can't even walk into Target without bothering customers
Bothering, asking me for a picture, can I talk to they sister?
Nah, nigga, get lost, you're fucking smothering
God, I wanna quit, but I can't
'Cause mother and sister can't pay the rent
Four stories with storage, I'm twenty-one with a mortgage
And touring's paying the bills, life is paying for thrills
Life's a bitch, bruh, but from the third floor, man, she's gorgeous
A year ago, I was broke; now, how can I afford this?
I started off with disposables; now, I have an assortment
And I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait
Now, the frame is a pain in the ass
To get it in without a scratch or stain on the glass, but that's not important
Just as long as it's printed, and I hinted it is
But when I get it, I'll make sure you get a copy, you bitch
Shit, I'll even add a signature with the fuckin' pic-a-ture
I'll even tell you the film I used, and the aperture

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Uh, Grandmother died, didn't cry, not a tear
Not gonna lie, fucking weird, no water dripped out the eye
But when I got the news, yup, it left your boy stuck
'Cause when my mom dipped, she was the one that gave me a fuck
Mom calling and calling, I'm on my way to a show
I answered, she crying, saying, ""Sadie is dying""
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak
Before she deceased, 'cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
Fuck! Nah, this is really awkward for me, bruh
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back
And started to think, like, ""What the fuck just happened?""
I never had a death, and I just seen her a week ago
Meet them at the hospital, I should
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD
Lionel asked what happened, I said it's bad, bad, not good
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood
Getting there, family sitting center chair
Awkward in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there
There's her room, open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, ""Hello""
Our conversation's brief
Couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
Lookin' at her, you could tell all she had was weak
And I'm not talkin' days, bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strength
I sat there, twenty minutes tops
Hoping it was just a fucking plea that she could cop
She died that night
[Outro: Dr. TC & Tyler, the Creator]
Oh, that's heavy, man
I'm sorry for your loss
Yeah, whatever
Don't worry about it...
The last time I seen Sammy, he was lookin' for you
Fuck that nigga, Samuel!
Uhh, have you seen him?
Nah, but if I seen that nigga, I woulda killed him29Embed"

Listen to bands, groove and we dance
Disco in France, smell some perfume, head in the wind (In the wind)
We can switch off
I can show you how you can really exfoliate skin
If you got a man, you should cut it off
Get your passport 'cause we runnin' off (Run off)

A young lady just fed me French vanilla ice cream
We all got our toes out, too
Call me when you get lost

I'ma travel the globe, you keep the block hot
Driver, open the door for me, my hand hurt
Find us, we playin' hide-and-seek with the passports
Where the fuck we at? Oh, the pilot gotta remind us, yeah
The luggage is pilin', I needed clothes to wear (Woo)
So many stinkies sit in my wallet, look like a folding chair (Yeah)
The Cartier so light on my body, thought I floated here
We boated here, it's Tunechi and Tyler, but call me Baudelaire, yeah
Out in Switzerland, travel with my bitch again, we kissin', dawg
I love when she let me rub her like Michelin (Skrrt, skrrt, facts)
A hundred grand to sleep on the bird, the wings are whistlin' like—
Man, they ain't listenin'
We crossed the line like immigrants and benefit from it
Keep on stuntin' on these niggas, make 'em sick to they stomach, man (I can't stop it)

I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me
Thought all this lean would have me senile, I guess they see now
Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns
I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out
And speed up my flow, I'm so greedy, I'ma eat my own flow
And I'm in need of a flow, might eat me a rapper and I might as well eat me a ho (Oh)

Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near twenty and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes just wide
My passport is the most valuable—

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me—, ehm, I'ma just go

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, when I turned twenty-three, that's when pubеrty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit mе
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um
Thoughts changed so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they loved me
First time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime
Grew into my style, body, and feelings, and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at one-nine
Mom was in the shelter when ""Yonkers"" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid
A flower gets its petal, they pluck it, but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows

Seein' that we only get one life to live
How far do you really wanna take it?
Don't let 'em ever tell you nothin' you can't do

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'
My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love, but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-of-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle covered in grass, lackin' gravel (Yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet, ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard, nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me and run like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me it's not good from your lunch break

Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see, as a kid, I felt alienated by the niggas who looked just like me
Niggas treated my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance
So, so I was like, I was like, ""Fuck 'em""
Fuck 'em, I did my own shit, and now I'm up and now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is

Lil' white bitch gon' say
""You need to say something about that""
""You need to say somethin' 'bout black—""
Bitch, suck my—
Yeah
Go time

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
That ain't your religion, you just followin' your mammy
She followed your granny, she obeyed master
Did y'all even ask up questions?
It's holes in them stories
Is it holes in your blessings?
Yeah, I'm bold with the message
I know I ain't got the answer
But I ain't gon' cheerlead with y'all just to be a dancer
I'ma groove to my own drums, sunlight in my shadow, baby
Move 'til my soul cums, let them serpents rattle, baby

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis & DJ Drama]
Crackin' like broke porcelain, bitch
We ocean deep if you just pour us in a portion of shit
Them people try to twist my view on some contortionist shit
I had to reevaluate what was important and shit (O-F)
Finders, keepers, when you creep inside my mind it's madness (Yeah)
If I see peace, I'm like a fiend (Ooh), uh, gotta have it
Lord, cover me I'm goin' in, walls closin' in (Uh)
How I'm supposed to be protected (Huh?) when the laws want us in?
Y'all want us dead, just 'cause the skin is the black type (Ah)
Teach me everything and be amazed I don't act right
What the fuck?
I'm tapped in the matrix, I'm back and they hate it
I'm black and make 'em pay me capital statements, you dig? (Ching)
Word on my back, I'm tryna fashion a statement
I ain't no bastard, we the master of the path that we blazin', you dig? (What?)
(On God, now)

I came a long way from my past, nigga, it's obvious
V12 engine, I'm fishtailin' on some sloppy shit (Skrrt)
Internet bringin' old lyrics up, like I hide the shit
What's your address, I could probably send you a copy, bitch
I was canceled before canceled was with Twitter fingers (Haha)
Protestin' outside my shows, I gave them the middle finger (Fuck 'em)
I was a teener, tweetin' Selena crazy shit
Didn't wanna offend her, apologize when I seen her
Back when I was tryna fuck Bieber, Justin
I say with my chest out, you say with your chest in, nigga (Say it with your chest, nigga)
Black bodies hanging from trees, I cannot make sense of this (Uh)
Hit some protest up, retweeted positive messages (Uh)
Donated some funds then I went and copped me a necklace
I'm probably a coon to your standard's based on this evidence
Am I doin' enough or not doin' enough?
I'm tryna run with the baton, but see, my shoe's in the mud
I feel like anything I say, dawg, I'm screwin' shit up (Sorry)
So I just tell these black babies, they should do what they want
Freedom, need 'em, my niggas, seen 'em
Free 'em, don't fuck with the law like, damn, Gina
So calm the fuck down before we duck rounds
And fireballs that make your family have to duck the fuck down
We frontline, we got the molotov that we can chuck now (Woo)
'Cause anytime we movin' up, it's like a ""What the fuck now?""
They playin' games, we strappin' up, we cock and aim (Yeah)
We aim to shoot, we shoot to claim what we need
We done with pain and the grievin', niggas is done with the peace
Whether it's personal or for the whole of niggas, indeed (Yah)
I might not have dreadlocks, I might have these gold teeth
But I'm a nigga like you, and you's a nigga like me (Yeah)
So let's be niggas together, and let's be niggas with plans
But put this plastic on first, 'cause shit is hittin' the fan, Scott
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Shit like this make me wanna turn my baseball cap to the side
You know, with the T.I. lean
Y'all fake mad
Catch up, niggas
Gettin' y'all identity, huh?

Alright, it's warm (Call me when you get lost, lost)
The waterfall is crazy
I don't know, make somethin' up, tell him somethin'
Uh, come on
Still on the boat
Call me if you get lost

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You and I, we fell in love
I ain't read the signs, ain't know what it was
But God gotta know he might have peaked when he made you
The cosmos' only mistake is what they named you (What that mean?)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar, 'cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, sugar, oh, you're so sweet

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I wish that we never met, I wish that we ain't connect
Like Lego, connection good, but mixed signal
If you say so, like cardio
We stared up and down, but we didn't blink
Felt like dirty dishes 'cause we was in sync
I swear to God, if you and him never linked
I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well
Twin, I'll never tell
Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Fana Hues, Tyler, The Creator & Fana Hues]
Maybe, maybe (For you)
What's the chance, though?
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you
So don't forget about me, ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you (Only for you, only for you)

Hornet trapped in the hive of a motherfuckin' bumblebee
They just got the closest picture of the fuckin' sun surface, that was us
Got the LaFerrari, park that bitch just for one purpose, catchin' dust
My Secret Service carry mops, you call 'em street sweepers, back you up
Tat' you up then add you up, then give you a cover like Adwoa
If the shit's fake, I don't respect it, it's clickbait
And that's distaste like a shit shake
What a difference your wrist make when it's Richard-made
Hungry eyes tend to fixate like a empty stomach for a fish plate
Shit-faced, get this straight, this is truck wheels, deck, grip tape

Ahem, fuck, yeah

[Verse 1]
Met you on a Saturday, knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was comin' to city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb
If I denied long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy
I wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, ""Bros over hoes,"" I'm like, ""Mm, nah, hey""
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake
But whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance
I'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh
See Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $188You might also like[Interlude]
It's, it's like starting a race
And then when you take off, they like, ""No, no, it's not a end,"" ha
It was too late and shit

[Verse 2]
FaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage
It's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like, ""Duh, bitch""
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Cross the line, cross the line, cross the— nah, we never did that
Though I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
Right in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, ""Ha-ha-ha""
Whenever we ""Ha-ha-ha,"" we subtly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real
Surface

[Interlude]
I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
But you know, they be fuckin', haha
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Didn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me
Know y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me
I feel guilty, but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could
I been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you

[Interlude]
You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, ""No, I want that,"" ha

[Verse 4]
He left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, ""No, you pick a place""
We could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, ""Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that""
Seven days with me, your nigga like, ""Where the fuck you at?""
Dirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot
Chauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants
Parks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane
Shoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?
See, the price is not a option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him, you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'
You stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
You told me when you with me, it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and
Told me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?
Told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him, it started problems, and
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off
He picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off
My energy like, ""Get lost,"" your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong, though
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta
We trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata
We sat in the car and cried for a hour
My shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls
No, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagara
Vill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or
Do something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, I thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it
You in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it— aw, fuck
We talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit when you in relationship
And you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint
'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along
But shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun
You still got your nigga and still had your fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real
I told you I love you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah
[Outro]
On God, I love that girl, f— mhm
I'm a sh— I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt, bruh
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing
And those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control
That made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt two hundred percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in the book32Embed"

Destination: remote
We done been everywhere
Only thing we ain't traveled
Is time (Yo)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
The boy record smell like bleach
I can travel where I want
I'm accustomed clearin' customs
It ain't custom, I don't come
Flee the bird to the truck
I scream, ""Au revoir,"" to the stewardess
Border control asking stupid shit
Stayin' at home, I hate
Runaway love, but I'm no Ludacris
Sippin' on mint tea, take my shoes off
Then we take off, then I snooze off
Until I land where I'm foreign
Then I wake up, wipe the drool off
Got my passport in my weekend
I'ma cool off, get a sweet tan
Loafers filled with beach sand
Recline 'til it's time to peace sign
Fuck all the chains and the cars, get a passport
See the world, open your eyes 'til your back hurt
Niggas get bread and won't leave, shit is backwards
Start with your feet, then a car, then an airport
Get out your bubble gum
Blow up horizons, sun
Sled in the Alps or go tube in Missoula
Or tour in Japan or go scuba in Cuba
Or land in a borough, Jerrod got the brioche
Ciabatta in Como, it matches my peacoat
Oversee the sea, all the things that you could see
Like them languages I speak, out in Paris for a week
Take my nephews out to Nice, they like ""Who?"" I'm like, ""Oui,"" ha

(What a day at the park) The Estate Sale
(What a day at the park)
(Gangsta Grillz)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Yeah, I pulled up in that eighteenth letter repeat buggy
Had to switch the hue 'cause them LA boys smuggy
But more likely to get hurt by somebody who love me
My lady, she don't trust me, know I'm a sick puppy
Know that women throw themselves at me and men want me
Anything could happen for attention and rent money
I got so much on my plate, that's why I sit funny
So many hand-outs, so much back bending
So much entitlement my family be actin' in
So many white diamonds, yеah, I got jungle fever
But thеy didn't raise me, so shout out black women
So much commentin', show me what you good at
Tell me the highs of the valley that your boots stood at
You couldn't fit in my loafers if you took a steroid
And I wouldn't handle your baggage if I had a bellboy
I'm rarely replying to texts, barely enjoying the sex
I got a pain in my chest, that's from suppressin' the stress
Lionel, he know me the best
Told me I know the answer, but Clancy, he gave me the best advice that I heard in a sec'
I need to call me a jet, I need to pack me a bag
I need to get me a cabin, need some scrimmage in chess
I could've bought me some land, I went and flooded my neck
I say this shit with my chest, I am like one of the best (Greatest)
I am a workaholic and I need to get me some rest
I'd rather get these ideas off, I'd rather not steer off my path
I'm so scared of going back to my past
I work, I swear it's hard not shaking that fear off
White boy said I brag too much, the black kid said it's inspiring
Duality is tiring, my girl would kill me if she knew the things I was desiring
Suppressing it, get it out the way, I put the sirens in, yeah

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Look, I don't fuck with parties, I don't fuck with the paparazzi
Never have I drove a Hellcat or a Maserati
Never needed others for my personal validation
She ain't gettin' touched if she cannot hold a conversation
Never had a bulky Richard Mille as a wristwatch
I never seen Amiri, never posted on TikTok
I never had desire for promethazine in a soda
Never made eye contact with a woman in Fashion Nova
Never had to fit in no lane
Never wore Beats By Dre headphones to get a video made, uh
Bunnyhop validated, pedaling
Hittin' wheelies like Chris retaliated, just look around
Every opportunity allocated
I put so many niggas on, you thought DJ Khaled made it
From cold showers, I used to hate it
Now I'm spendin' fifteen for the new roof, it ain't renovated
I could see the ocean where I sleep and the house is gated
No Calabasas, I Brentwood it or Palisade it
The freckled girls articulating art got me salivating (I love it)
Wall is Henry Taylor with the trunks, I be playing Jenga
The last tour, dog, I cleaned house
They mad I made it, I'm so conceited
Feeling myself, ego masturbating, I graduated
After album five, I got syndicated, you want the old T?
Sorry G, that picture faded
Come get wit' me
[Break: DJ Drama]
(What a day at the park) I like to call that
(What a day at the park) Oh my God

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, I'm a dead poet (Poet), tabletop stumpin' (Stumpin')
I'm a free spirit, have the whole jail jumpin' (Jumpin')
Ever since a youngin', moved at my pace (At my own)
Scared of having youngins 'cause I like my space (Yeah)
Selfish ain't the word (Nope), regret ain't either (Nuh-uh)
Before you get the huffin' and the puffin', take a breather (Hah-hah-hah)
Put yourself first if you're livin' with a dream (Put yourself first)

Where we goin'? We should get lost
No more questions, let the wharf talk, uh
(So there's a lot goin' on, make you comfortable)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I want you to come get lost with me
Ask you one more time before I tread too deep (I want you)

Spend it all in one out, wanna split some
Some here with you right now
(Whatever you want)
If you got cold feet, it's warm by the water
You can turn your page around, let me be the author
Don't leave your destiny by the harbor

Except for some her time and all her love, that's my concern

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I shook your hand, I don't respect
Don't call me king, I'm not your twin
I'm not your brother, we just met
See, I won't purchase her no Birkin (Uh)
Got hobbies (Uh), got purpose (Woo)
Got thumpers, I'm perfect (Uh)
Yeah, Kelly green wagon look better when the gloom out
Canary shine brighter in the dark, I brought the moon out
The plane fly better when it's just me and the pilot
Tuition for the mileage, it's worth it for the silence

Ring, ring, ring, bitch, pick up the phone
I don't care if y'all together, I will tear down a home, shit
I shimmy through Paris in back of Phantom of the threads
The driver's seat of the Enzo could barely fit my legs
And Virgil my chaperone, he look out from overhead (Love you, V)
Not sure what you overheard, but it's probably what I said, bitch
I'm out here livin', y'all on the feed (Yuck)
My girl look like Zazie Beetz and Kelis (Yuck)
I pull up in the ""What the fuck is that, dog?"" (I said, ""Yuck"")
It's Mr. Peculiar, that's who I be, who I be
Niggas tellin' women how they bodies supposed to be, but
Never take advice from any nigga with a lean gut (Fuck these niggas)
Keep your chair rockin' and my two cents in your pocket

Chillin' with my suit on
Travel trunk is either Moynat leather or it's Vuitton
Sippin' mint tea like we know the tree the leaf fell from
We come from them tiki punch drinks
Had animosity for dinner, El Pollo Loco
That was in the past, now I parmesan my bolo'
Half a million driftin' and the tire readin' ""Toyo""
Prefer the alligator logo on my cotton polo (Yeah)

The big yard, quaint size with the immaculate view
My boat dock got a yacht with a slide on the side
My son and I got some bikes we could ride, I'll show him how to wheelie
And Wally hit my celly, we cleared another dealy
It's no contingency, the number's in the hundred milly's (Woo-hoo-hoo)

Soccer mom with the Vans in every color it seems
Kids push down the block, cuttin' Dickies into shorts when it's hot
Fuckin' Wendy's up, brainstormin' ways to get our pennies up
Me and Jasper spendin' last bucks on the city bus
Wayne tapes and Vice mags and Portishead drops
Peglegs, Ice Cream shoes, the Mr. Krabs watch
That was heaven for me 'round time seventeen
Eggin' niggas' houses, fuckin' girls from Pasadena
Bastard wasn't finished, I was formin' up a team

So you stalk, make up fibs, just to talk about my private life 'cause you're weird (Uh)
Met that girl this year (But), that's none ya biz
Give enough with my art, know your place
My personal space, y'all don't need to to be a part
I'm sorry I don't wanna link and small talk over dinner
I don't even drink, can't guilt trip me, I'm ice cold, roller rink
Nigga-nigga-nigga, read the room
Don't assume niggas is cool
Stay in your pocket, this is pool
Blah, blah, blah, blah 'bout trauma
You ain't special, everybody got problems, uh
Sorry I'm not empathetic (Nah, I'm fuckin')
Sorry you think I'm pathetic
Sorry I don't wanna bro down
Sorry I don't know your pronouns
I don't mean no disrespect
But, damn, we just met, calm the fuck down
Oh, I'm out of touch and I'm a jerk?
A bank account could never match my worth (That nigga gettin' money, he a dick now)
Sorry, Mother Earth
Polluted air with chemicals and dirt
These cars ain't gonna buy and drive themselves
What the hell you think I work for?
Not to not explore and stay the same (I'm)
Sorry to the fans who say I changed, 'cause I did
Sorry you don't know me on a personal level to pinpoint what it is
I'm sorry to my ancestors (I'm so sorry), I know I'm supposed to fight (I know)
But this ice shinin' brighter than a black man's plight, I'ma make it right
In the meantime, I'll give some advice while these blood diamonds gettin' cleaned off
Nigga, fuck the price, spend it then, then again, I can't save niggas
I'm not Superman, but I could try
I'm sorry I'm pretentious
Sorry that the talent, knowledge, passion isn't missin'
Sorry when I talk my shit and I could back it up with confidence, it get you niggas trippin', man
Fuck the numbers, fuck a hook
You put me on a stage and I'll show you the difference
Let me see y'all hit a stage (No, y'all can't do it)
Let me see y'all write a page (Y'all not gon' do it)
Let me see you make a decision I made
And claim that I don't know about minimum wage or Section 8
Water in the ketchup bottle to stretch when niggas ate
Gettin' pressed by niggas hoppin' gates
Thinkin' it's normal 'cause you ain't supposed to make it past eighteen or escape the Figure 8 cycle
And I promise this is like a diet, I'ma make a way and I did, did
Feel good, work paid off, now we gon' celebrate
But niggas claim you arrogant when they can't relate to moments of feelin' great
So they aim, duck-duck-duck 'em
Shot right back, buck-buck-buck 'em
Sorry, not sorry (Buck 'em, buck 'em)
I got two words, fuck 'em

We all got our toes out, too
Call me when you get lost

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
I'ma travel the globe, you keep the block hot
Driver, open the door for me, my hand hurt
Find us, we playin' hide-and-seek with the passports
Where the fuck we at? Oh, the pilot gotta remind us, yeah
The luggage is pilin', I needed clothes to wear (Woo)
So many stinkies sit in my wallet, look like a folding chair (Yeah)
The Cartier so light on my body, thought I floated here
We boated here, it's Tunechi and Tyler, but call me Baudelaire, yeah
Out in Switzerland, travel with my bitch again, we kissin', dawg
I love when she let me rub her like Michelin (Skrrt, skrrt, facts)
A hundred grand to sleep on the bird, the wings are whistlin' like—
Man, they ain't listenin'
We crossed the line like immigrants and benefit from it
Keep on stuntin' on these niggas, make 'em sick to they stomach, man (I can't stop it)
Y'all don't understand, fish so fresh that you could taste the sand
Yeah, we gettin' lost but we know who we am (True story)

Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard at me
Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beef
And I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat
Got my middle fingers to the cameras that's recording me
From y'all to me, brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering
I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me
Thought all this lean would have me senile, I guess they see now
Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns
I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out
And speed up my flow, I'm so greedy, I'ma eat my own flow
And I'm in need of a flow, might eat me a rapper and I might as well eat me a ho (Oh)
I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin', as cold as the devil and demon and ghost
I'ma get even and even, get even some more, it's too late to even get low, baow

Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near twenty and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes just wide
My passport is the most valuable—

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me—, ehm, I'ma just go

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, when I turned twenty-three, that's when pubеrty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit mе
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um
Thoughts changed so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they loved me
First time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime
Grew into my style, body, and feelings, and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at one-nine
Mom was in the shelter when ""Yonkers"" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid
A flower gets its petal, they pluck it, but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows

Eyes open if I pray 'cause I can't trust God either, uh

[Break: DJ Drama]
Seein' that we only get one life to live
How far do you really wanna take it?
Don't let 'em ever tell you nothin' you can't do

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'
My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love, but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-of-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle covered in grass, lackin' gravel (Yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet, ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard, nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me and run like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me it's not good from your lunch break

Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see, as a kid, I felt alienated by the niggas who looked just like me
Niggas treated my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance
So, so I was like, I was like, ""Fuck 'em""
Fuck 'em, I did my own shit, and now I'm up and now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
When they talk about, ""That nigga,"" I'm him, I'm him, I'm that nigga
(Run)
It's funny, right? (Run)
For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gon' be here (Run)

She followed your granny, she obeyed master
Did y'all even ask up questions?
It's holes in them stories
Is it holes in your blessings?
Yeah, I'm bold with the message
I know I ain't got the answer
But I ain't gon' cheerlead with y'all just to be a dancer
I'ma groove to my own drums, sunlight in my shadow, baby
Move 'til my soul cums, let them serpents rattle, baby

If I see peace, I'm like a fiend (Ooh), uh, gotta have it
Lord, cover me I'm goin' in, walls closin' in (Uh)
How I'm supposed to be protected (Huh?) when the laws want us in?
Y'all want us dead, just 'cause the skin is the black type (Ah)
Teach me everything and be amazed I don't act right

Black bodies hanging from trees, I cannot make sense of this (Uh)

Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck

Shit, his daddy fine
Nah, his daddy, his momma fine, bitch
What you mean? He got his looks from me
You better tell this ho, this my nigga, though
My ride or die, I’d kill a motherfucker over this one right here, nigga
I'd stand in front of a bullet, on God, over this one
My son used to record me beatin' bitches’ ass, facts
I didn't give a fuck
I, I bossed up on teachers, principals, mamas, kids
I didn't give a fu-am I lying?
You have no reason to
No
If you fuck with my kids, I'll beat up kids over my kid, okay?
This little boy used to run, he was scared
I said, ""Go get your bitch-ass mama""
I would beat your whole family and didn't give a fuck
They be like, ""Tyler, Tyler mama crazy, Tyler mama crazy""
Yup, don't fuck with my kids
Tyler would be like ""Get 'em, mom""
But she like ""No, don't do it""
Tyler would be like ""Get ’em, mom, get ’em""

Ahem, fuck, yeah

[Verse 1]
Met you on a Saturday, knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was comin' to city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb
If I denied long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy
I wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, ""Bros over hoes,"" I'm like, ""Mm, nah, hey""
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake
But whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance
I'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh

And then when you take off, they like, ""No, no, it's not a end,"" ha
It was too late and shit

[Verse 2]
FaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage
It's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like, ""Duh, bitch""
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Cross the line, cross the line, cross the— nah, we never did that
Though I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
Right in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, ""Ha-ha-ha""
Whenever we ""Ha-ha-ha,"" we subtly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real
Surface

[Interlude]
I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
But you know, they be fuckin', haha
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Didn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me
Know y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me
I feel guilty, but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could
I been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you

[Interlude]
You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, ""No, I want that,"" ha

[Verse 4]
He left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, ""No, you pick a place""
We could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, ""Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that""
Seven days with me, your nigga like, ""Where the fuck you at?""
Dirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot
Chauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants
Parks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane
Shoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?
See, the price is not a option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him, you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'
You stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
You told me when you with me, it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and
Told me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?
Told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him, it started problems, and
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off
He picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off
My energy like, ""Get lost,"" your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong, though
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta
We trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata
We sat in the car and cried for a hour
My shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls
No, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagara
Vill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or
Do something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, I thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it
You in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it— aw, fuck
We talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit when you in relationship
And you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint
'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along
But shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun
You still got your nigga and still had your fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real
I told you I love you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah
[Outro]
On God, I love that girl, f— mhm
I'm a sh— I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt, bruh
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing
And those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control
That made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt two hundred percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in the book32Embed"

Destination: remote
We done been everywhere
Only thing we ain't traveled
Is time (Yo)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
The boy record smell like bleach
I can travel where I want
I'm accustomed clearin' customs
It ain't custom, I don't come
Flee the bird to the truck
I scream, ""Au revoir,"" to the stewardess
Border control asking stupid shit
Stayin' at home, I hate
Runaway love, but I'm no Ludacris
Sippin' on mint tea, take my shoes off
Then we take off, then I snooze off
Until I land where I'm foreign
Then I wake up, wipe the drool off
Got my passport in my weekend
I'ma cool off, get a sweet tan
Loafers filled with beach sand
Recline 'til it's time to peace sign
Fuck all the chains and the cars, get a passport
See the world, open your eyes 'til your back hurt
Niggas get bread and won't leave, shit is backwards
Start with your feet, then a car, then an airport
Get out your bubble gum
Blow up horizons, sun
Sled in the Alps or go tube in Missoula
Or tour in Japan or go scuba in Cuba
Or land in a borough, Jerrod got the brioche
Ciabatta in Como, it matches my peacoat
Oversee the sea, all the things that you could see
Like them languages I speak, out in Paris for a week
Take my nephews out to Nice, they like ""Who?"" I'm like, ""Oui,"" ha

Every car retarded, the garage look like a loony bin
What coupe he in? Depends on the 'fit and the type of mood he in (Ugh)
I been switchin' gears since Tracee Ellis Ross was UPN
Clutch, then he stroke outta nowhere like a droopy grin (Ugh)
Huh, took that Grammy home, couldn't lose again
The suit was so sharp that it could get Medusa coochie trimmed (Ugh)
Hov talkin' 'bout a hundred million, nigga, loop me in
Like who that young, rich, handsome nigga with the gooey skin? (Ugh)
Mama named him Tyler and his brothers call him T
And the bank, they call him when that wire clear like season three or somethin' (Ugh)
Skateboard named him Bunnyhop, it's Baudelaire or Wolfie, though
The felines named him hour for how long he eat the— (Pussy) wait a minute (Ugh)
Pink loafers scuff quickly, Fiat cost a buck sixty
I'll keep it a buck fifty, y'all can't really fuck with me (Ugh)
Bitch, I got the fuzz and I'ma own it 'til they bury him
Only twenty-nine, but I've been focused since thirty M (Ugh)

Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near twenty and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes just wide
My passport is the most valuable—

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me—, ehm, I'ma just go

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, when I turned twenty-three, that's when pubеrty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit mе
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um
Thoughts changed so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they loved me
First time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime
Grew into my style, body, and feelings, and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at one-nine
Mom was in the shelter when ""Yonkers"" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid
A flower gets its petal, they pluck it, but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows

Yeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'
My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love, but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-of-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle covered in grass, lackin' gravel (Yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet, ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard, nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me and run like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me it's not good from your lunch break

So, so I was like, I was like, ""Fuck 'em""
Fuck 'em, I did my own shit, and now I'm up and now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go

Lil' white bitch gon' say
""You need to say something about that""
""You need to say somethin' 'bout black—""
Bitch, suck my—
Yeah
Go time

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
That ain't your religion, you just followin' your mammy
She followed your granny, she obeyed master
Did y'all even ask up questions?
It's holes in them stories
Is it holes in your blessings?
Yeah, I'm bold with the message
I know I ain't got the answer
But I ain't gon' cheerlead with y'all just to be a dancer
I'ma groove to my own drums, sunlight in my shadow, baby
Move 'til my soul cums, let them serpents rattle, baby

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis & DJ Drama]
Crackin' like broke porcelain, bitch
We ocean deep if you just pour us in a portion of shit
Them people try to twist my view on some contortionist shit
I had to reevaluate what was important and shit (O-F)
Finders, keepers, when you creep inside my mind it's madness (Yeah)
If I see peace, I'm like a fiend (Ooh), uh, gotta have it
Lord, cover me I'm goin' in, walls closin' in (Uh)
How I'm supposed to be protected (Huh?) when the laws want us in?
Y'all want us dead, just 'cause the skin is the black type (Ah)
Teach me everything and be amazed I don't act right
What the fuck?
I'm tapped in the matrix, I'm back and they hate it
I'm black and make 'em pay me capital statements, you dig? (Ching)
Word on my back, I'm tryna fashion a statement
I ain't no bastard, we the master of the path that we blazin', you dig? (What?)
(On God, now)

I came a long way from my past, nigga, it's obvious
V12 engine, I'm fishtailin' on some sloppy shit (Skrrt)
Internet bringin' old lyrics up, like I hide the shit
What's your address, I could probably send you a copy, bitch
I was canceled before canceled was with Twitter fingers (Haha)
Protestin' outside my shows, I gave them the middle finger (Fuck 'em)
I was a teener, tweetin' Selena crazy shit
Didn't wanna offend her, apologize when I seen her
Back when I was tryna fuck Bieber, Justin
I say with my chest out, you say with your chest in, nigga (Say it with your chest, nigga)
Black bodies hanging from trees, I cannot make sense of this (Uh)
Hit some protest up, retweeted positive messages (Uh)
Donated some funds then I went and copped me a necklace
I'm probably a coon to your standard's based on this evidence
Am I doin' enough or not doin' enough?
I'm tryna run with the baton, but see, my shoe's in the mud
I feel like anything I say, dawg, I'm screwin' shit up (Sorry)
So I just tell these black babies, they should do what they want
Freedom, need 'em, my niggas, seen 'em
Free 'em, don't fuck with the law like, damn, Gina
So calm the fuck down before we duck rounds
And fireballs that make your family have to duck the fuck down
We frontline, we got the molotov that we can chuck now (Woo)
'Cause anytime we movin' up, it's like a ""What the fuck now?""
They playin' games, we strappin' up, we cock and aim (Yeah)
We aim to shoot, we shoot to claim what we need
We done with pain and the grievin', niggas is done with the peace
Whether it's personal or for the whole of niggas, indeed (Yah)
I might not have dreadlocks, I might have these gold teeth
But I'm a nigga like you, and you's a nigga like me (Yeah)
So let's be niggas together, and let's be niggas with plans
But put this plastic on first, 'cause shit is hittin' the fan, Scott
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Shit like this make me wanna turn my baseball cap to the side

No, no, no, no, no, no, listen, listen (Call me when you get lost, lost)
The driver gon' drop you off
Alright, it's warm (Call me when you get lost, lost)
The waterfall is crazy
I don't know, make somethin' up, tell him somethin'
Uh, come on
Still on the boat
Call me if you get lost

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You and I, we fell in love
I ain't read the signs, ain't know what it was
But God gotta know he might have peaked when he made you
The cosmos' only mistake is what they named you (What that mean?)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar, 'cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, sugar, oh, you're so sweet
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I wish that we never met, I wish that we ain't connect
Like Lego, connection good, but mixed signal
If you say so, like cardio
We stared up and down, but we didn't blink
Felt like dirty dishes 'cause we was in sync
I swear to God, if you and him never linked
I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well
Twin, I'll never tell
Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Fana Hues, Tyler, The Creator & Fana Hues]
Maybe, maybe (For you)
What's the chance, though?
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you
So don't forget about me, ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you
I wish that we had better timing

Hey Miss Parker
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Somethin' like (Uh-oh)
I just cut some fresh lemons, where's the sugar?
Lemon in my 'ade, lemon in my ears, call 'em boogers
Rather six feet 'fore I'm ever seen with you niggas (Hold up)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
What it is? It's that nigga T, skin look colored in (Woo)
Ridin' in double-double R, that's that Cullinan (Yeah)
Pullin' in that four hundred grand, I just ordered this (Yeah)
Switzerland, Lake Geneva where I spend my summer in (True story)
GOLF le FLEUR*, that's Gianno shoe, what I'm runnin' in
Earlobe look like headlights on a minivan (Gangsta Grillz)
I'm so motherfuckin' dead-ass, I need some Timberlands (Woo)
I battle any man, Uzi Vert, don't think they understand (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert & Tyler, The Creator]
Uh (Skrrt, cool), double C on my feet
Double G on my freak (Ooh), Louis V by my briefs
She wan' kick it with me, she better eat it then leave (Leave, woah)
She try save all the plates but keep eatin' my meat
We can't see none of 'em grow, she keep eatin' my seeds (Woo)
Got a E and a B on the back of the seat
See I'm done with the 12, got a V16 (Uh)
Say the money comin' in, yeah, that's true
The more money I get, I don't wan' sex you
Can't think about the last time that I text you
It's probably when sidekicks had them belt loops
Sign my John Hancock on a bitch every time I check you
Just like a brand new Lamb', I wreck you, uh

It's the double P, I rock double C
Man, I run them beats like you run in cleats
Man, come to me, you want somethin' to see
This internally flawed, that's a double Vs
What troubles me is you couple me
With these subtle fleas tryna double league
Hornet trapped in the hive of a motherfuckin' bumblebee
They just got the closest picture of the fuckin' sun surface, that was us
Got the LaFerrari, park that bitch just for one purpose, catchin' dust
My Secret Service carry mops, you call 'em street sweepers, back you up
Tat' you up then add you up, then give you a cover like Adwoa
If the shit's fake, I don't respect it, it's clickbait
And that's distaste like a shit shake
What a difference your wrist make when it's Richard-made
Hungry eyes tend to fixate like a empty stomach for a fish plate

Ahem, fuck, yeah

[Verse 1]
Met you on a Saturday, knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was comin' to city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb
If I denied long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy
I wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, ""Bros over hoes,"" I'm like, ""Mm, nah, hey""
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake
But whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance
I'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh
See Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $188You might also like[Interlude]
It's, it's like starting a race
And then when you take off, they like, ""No, no, it's not a end,"" ha
It was too late and shit

[Verse 2]
FaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage
It's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like, ""Duh, bitch""
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Cross the line, cross the line, cross the— nah, we never did that
Though I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
Right in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, ""Ha-ha-ha""
Whenever we ""Ha-ha-ha,"" we subtly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real
Surface

[Interlude]
I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
But you know, they be fuckin', haha
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Didn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me
Know y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me
I feel guilty, but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could
I been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you

[Interlude]
You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, ""No, I want that,"" ha

[Verse 4]
He left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, ""No, you pick a place""
We could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, ""Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that""
Seven days with me, your nigga like, ""Where the fuck you at?""
Dirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot
Chauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants
Parks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane
Shoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?
See, the price is not a option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him, you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'
You stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
You told me when you with me, it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and
Told me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?
Told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him, it started problems, and
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off
He picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off
My energy like, ""Get lost,"" your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong, though
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta
We trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata
We sat in the car and cried for a hour
My shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls
No, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagara
Vill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or
Do something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, I thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it
You in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it— aw, fuck
We talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit when you in relationship
And you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint
'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along
But shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun
You still got your nigga and still had your fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real
I told you I love you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah
[Outro]
On God, I love that girl, f— mhm
I'm a sh— I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt, bruh
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing
And those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control
That made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt two hundred percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in the book32Embed"

Fishtailin', I'm fishtailin'

[Verse 1]
Hawthorne, California, years that I was formin' up
Before the world would know me and I would come and perform for ya
I was baby boy seein' things outside of my cornea
In the world with mama, where papa didn't show up for us
I ain't let it phase me, I just focused on my wishes
Execute ideas and accumulate multi-millions (Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow)
Gеt a bigger house with a kitchen to cook our mеals in
No niggas that can press me whenever I exit buildin'
A boy on handlebars that would listen to all my demos
That list was 'bout as long as a limo, but, here's the memo
Them niggas that look like me treat my nuance as a nuisance
So they would segregate me 'cause I didn't match they blueprint
What you think that's tied to? Shit, they don't know, but I do
So we don't match in eye view, nigga, you peaked in high school
So we can not compare, your perspective is stuck, goner
'Cause I was signin' eight-figure checks with my gloves on

So do not pay me no mind

[Verse 2]

""How it feel? How it feel?"" My nigga, it's so good
Smile on that baby face, schooling I was fuckin' up
Focused, I was comin' up, them kiddies had them tummies up
Was nineteen years of age when my pockets was 'bout a hundred up
How I get them checks off, nigga?
I ate and I paid my mama's debt off, nigga
Now the pay stubs is silly, it's millis from old banter
The ice near my shoulders colder than Homelander
No lackin', ma, the jimmy is strapped like some old sandals
I don't brag 'em, but she said my shit longer than old phantoms (Skrrt)
No alcohol or opium (Nope), he sober like some polar skin
He focused, 'cause he ain't think rap could take him to this podium (Yeah)
Livin' every day to the fullest, but move in silence
So romanticize your life, 'cause tomorrow ain't pinky promised

Bitch, I'm fishtailin', yeah
I ain't think rap could take me this far, for real

Can you turn the noise up? Can you turn the noise up? (Go, go, go, go)

Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near twenty and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes just wide
My passport is the most valuable—

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me—, ehm, I'ma just go

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, when I turned twenty-three, that's when pubеrty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit mе
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um
Thoughts changed so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they loved me
First time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime
Grew into my style, body, and feelings, and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at one-nine
Mom was in the shelter when ""Yonkers"" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid
A flower gets its petal, they pluck it, but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows

Yeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'
My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love, but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-of-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle covered in grass, lackin' gravel (Yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet, ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard, nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me and run like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me it's not good from your lunch break

Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see, as a kid, I felt alienated by the niggas who looked just like me
Niggas treated my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance
So, so I was like, I was like, ""Fuck 'em""
Fuck 'em, I did my own shit, and now I'm up and now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
When they talk about, ""That nigga,"" I'm him, I'm him, I'm that nigga

For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gon' be here (Run)

Lil' white bitch gon' say
""You need to say something about that""
""You need to say somethin' 'bout black—""
Bitch, suck my—
Yeah
Go time

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
That ain't your religion, you just followin' your mammy
She followed your granny, she obeyed master
Did y'all even ask up questions?
It's holes in them stories
Is it holes in your blessings?
Yeah, I'm bold with the message
I know I ain't got the answer
But I ain't gon' cheerlead with y'all just to be a dancer
I'ma groove to my own drums, sunlight in my shadow, baby
Move 'til my soul cums, let them serpents rattle, baby

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis & DJ Drama]
Crackin' like broke porcelain, bitch
We ocean deep if you just pour us in a portion of shit
Them people try to twist my view on some contortionist shit
I had to reevaluate what was important and shit (O-F)
Finders, keepers, when you creep inside my mind it's madness (Yeah)
If I see peace, I'm like a fiend (Ooh), uh, gotta have it
Lord, cover me I'm goin' in, walls closin' in (Uh)
How I'm supposed to be protected (Huh?) when the laws want us in?
Y'all want us dead, just 'cause the skin is the black type (Ah)
Teach me everything and be amazed I don't act right
What the fuck?
I'm tapped in the matrix, I'm back and they hate it
I'm black and make 'em pay me capital statements, you dig? (Ching)
Word on my back, I'm tryna fashion a statement
I ain't no bastard, we the master of the path that we blazin', you dig? (What?)

Internet bringin' old lyrics up, like I hide the shit
What's your address, I could probably send you a copy, bitch
I was canceled before canceled was with Twitter fingers (Haha)
Protestin' outside my shows, I gave them the middle finger (Fuck 'em)
I was a teener, tweetin' Selena crazy shit
Didn't wanna offend her, apologize when I seen her
Back when I was tryna fuck Bieber, Justin
I say with my chest out, you say with your chest in, nigga (Say it with your chest, nigga)
Black bodies hanging from trees, I cannot make sense of this (Uh)
Hit some protest up, retweeted positive messages (Uh)
Donated some funds then I went and copped me a necklace
I'm probably a coon to your standard's based on this evidence
Am I doin' enough or not doin' enough?
I'm tryna run with the baton, but see, my shoe's in the mud
I feel like anything I say, dawg, I'm screwin' shit up (Sorry)
So I just tell these black babies, they should do what they want
Freedom, need 'em, my niggas, seen 'em
Free 'em, don't fuck with the law like, damn, Gina
So calm the fuck down before we duck rounds
And fireballs that make your family have to duck the fuck down
We frontline, we got the molotov that we can chuck now (Woo)
'Cause anytime we movin' up, it's like a ""What the fuck now?""
They playin' games, we strappin' up, we cock and aim (Yeah)
We aim to shoot, we shoot to claim what we need
We done with pain and the grievin', niggas is done with the peace
Whether it's personal or for the whole of niggas, indeed (Yah)
I might not have dreadlocks, I might have these gold teeth
But I'm a nigga like you, and you's a nigga like me (Yeah)
So let's be niggas together, and let's be niggas with plans

No, no, no, no, no, no, listen, listen (Call me when you get lost, lost)
The driver gon' drop you off
Alright, it's warm (Call me when you get lost, lost)
The waterfall is crazy
I don't know, make somethin' up, tell him somethin'
Uh, come on
Still on the boat
Call me if you get lost

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You and I, we fell in love
I ain't read the signs, ain't know what it was
But God gotta know he might have peaked when he made you
The cosmos' only mistake is what they named you (What that mean?)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar, 'cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, sugar, oh, you're so sweet
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known

And I just wanted you to know (They should call you sugar)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I wish that we never met, I wish that we ain't connect
Like Lego, connection good, but mixed signal
If you say so, like cardio
We stared up and down, but we didn't blink
Felt like dirty dishes 'cause we was in sync
I swear to God, if you and him never linked
I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well
Twin, I'll never tell
Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I

What's the chance, though?
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you

The only flaw is my fuckin' hair won't grow
It's been like two years and this shit likе two inches
Come get lost with me, man, come, come, come see the world
When you, when you really get out there, call me, I'll be there

Pullin' in that four hundred grand, I just ordered this (Yeah)

Ahem, fuck, yeah

[Verse 1]
Met you on a Saturday, knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was comin' to city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb
If I denied long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy
I wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, ""Bros over hoes,"" I'm like, ""Mm, nah, hey""
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake
But whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance
I'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh

It's, it's like starting a race
And then when you take off, they like, ""No, no, it's not a end,"" ha
It was too late and shit

[Verse 2]
FaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage
It's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like, ""Duh, bitch""
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Cross the line, cross the line, cross the— nah, we never did that
Though I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
Right in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, ""Ha-ha-ha""
Whenever we ""Ha-ha-ha,"" we subtly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real
Surface

[Interlude]
I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
But you know, they be fuckin', haha
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Didn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me
Know y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me
I feel guilty, but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could
I been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you

[Interlude]
You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, ""No, I want that,"" ha

[Verse 4]
He left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, ""No, you pick a place""
We could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, ""Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that""
Seven days with me, your nigga like, ""Where the fuck you at?""
Dirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot
Chauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants
Parks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane
Shoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?
See, the price is not a option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him, you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'
You stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
You told me when you with me, it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and
Told me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?
Told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him, it started problems, and
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off
He picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off
My energy like, ""Get lost,"" your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong, though
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta
We trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata
We sat in the car and cried for a hour
My shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls
No, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagara
Vill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or
Do something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, I thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it
You in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it— aw, fuck
We talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit when you in relationship
And you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint
'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along
But shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun
You still got your nigga and still had your fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real
I told you I love you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah
[Outro]
On God, I love that girl, f— mhm
I'm a sh— I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt, bruh
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing
And those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control
That made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt two hundred percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in the book32Embed"

Destination: remote
We done been everywhere
Only thing we ain't traveled
Is time (Yo)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
The boy record smell like bleach
I can travel where I want
I'm accustomed clearin' customs
It ain't custom, I don't come
Flee the bird to the truck
I scream, ""Au revoir,"" to the stewardess
Border control asking stupid shit
Stayin' at home, I hate
Runaway love, but I'm no Ludacris
Sippin' on mint tea, take my shoes off
Then we take off, then I snooze off
Until I land where I'm foreign
Then I wake up, wipe the drool off
Got my passport in my weekend
I'ma cool off, get a sweet tan
Loafers filled with beach sand
Recline 'til it's time to peace sign
Fuck all the chains and the cars, get a passport
See the world, open your eyes 'til your back hurt
Niggas get bread and won't leave, shit is backwards
Start with your feet, then a car, then an airport
Get out your bubble gum
Blow up horizons, sun
Sled in the Alps or go tube in Missoula
Or tour in Japan or go scuba in Cuba
Or land in a borough, Jerrod got the brioche
Ciabatta in Como, it matches my peacoat
Oversee the sea, all the things that you could see
Like them languages I speak, out in Paris for a week
Take my nephews out to Nice, they like ""Who?"" I'm like, ""Oui,"" ha

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon’ leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it’s rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love’s gone, my love’s gone
My love's gone, gone

I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can’t compete with me

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love’s gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going, and now I'm scarred for life

[Interlude: CeeLo Green]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
It was my fault, I reached
That contract got breached
Now I'm back roaming the streets
So peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)
[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

[Part II: THANK YOU]

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
(Got my eye)
I said go, go

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, but the walkin' depends
If you can’t understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't—
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high

I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
What do you need? Do you need bread?
Do you need this? Do you need a hug?
Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list
See, I am Santa, where is Rudolph?
You're parasitic, I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder, is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

[Verse 1]
Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cops ask my name, bitch, I'm Igor

[Chorus]
Yeah, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic

Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone

Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door

Knock, knock, knock, knock (Who is it?)
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, but the walkin' depends
If you can’t understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't—
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
What do you need? Do you need bread?
Do you need this? Do you need a hug?
Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list
See, I am Santa, where is Rudolph?
You're parasitic, I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder, is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open, now I see the

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from

You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You keep me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going away, and now I'm scarred for life

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
(My love is gone)
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
(My love is gone)
Knock, knock, knock, knock (Who is it?)
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)
[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul
[Part II: THANK YOU]

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, excuse me mister, but can you please turn down the lights?
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga
I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special, the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego there so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime, brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school)
And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search Of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man, I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder
Than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada but let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named my album ""Cherry Bomb"" because ""Greatest Hits"" sounded boring
I don't like to follow the rules
She said that I must, I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk; ""Who's in charge of this Golf shit?""
I said ""Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick.""
It's young T

And that's just who I am
I hope you understand
And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand
Better pose for that camera
You better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action
Now your face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life

[Outro]
Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips high-five my tongue
And my fingers moonwalk through your hair
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp

You should be mine in a way tonight

God, goodness gracious
I can't wait to see the look on y'all niggas faces
That boy T nuts, surprised his thoughts isn't chafing
And fuck them crackers up at Mountain Dew, them niggas is racist
Cabbage was made, critic faggots was shook
So I told 'em that I'll exchange the word ""faggot"" with ""book""
And all them ""books"" is pissed off and had they page in a bunch
Fucking attitude switched just like a ""book"" when it struts
But I'm a fraud, I pray to God when the six triple ""book"" bashing
While me and my favorite author's lips tickle
Peter Parker pick a pack of peppers when the plot thickens
Tyler, The Creator fucking kill you with a popsicle
Cold blooded, so we rock mittens so they won't find him
Not kidding, keep the Tommy on me; bitch, I'm Ms. Pickles
Said I seemed off, last time that team talked
Sick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'Preme off
Should've bought some stock in it (Yo, it's fucked up, I get it, put a sock in it)
Not Golf when the little homies don't—wait, let's weigh my options
I bought me a mansion, and bought some attention
Ain't give none to Hopsin, and dear Boyce Watkins
Why you mad? It's the slave in me
It's facts, boy, I'm back like Rosa Parks's least favorite seat
Videos, stage dives, popups, they watching T
While y'all niggas watching the throne, the throne be watching me

Now fasten your seat belt, and turn everything off
I got your attention, motherfucker, I'm bout to take off
I'm the new pilot in this bitch
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip
But I do bring a terror like I hate America
A brand new camera and a parachute
Nigga, you and I are not the same, we not parallel
Don't talk to me 'fore I fucking embarrass you
Now sit your ass down, you doing three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up
Or you'll get fucked up

I'm a pervert with a purpose, like priest who just got saved
Kissing, kissing, I'm on a mission of licking
The holy grail of your body, when you be pissin'
This is a kid from Africa, you, you are a kitchen
I come quicker than pitches from Sammy Sosa, you hoping I'm joking, but first

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
I'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming ""Stop it,"" don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face
But that won't happen 'til I blow my load
I'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming ""Stop it,"" don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face
But that won't happen 'til I blow my load

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Your pussy tighter than door hinges, I munch you like sandwiches
But not any more 'cause I'm on tour, so
Look: FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick
I go hard, shit, I might need ice pack on my wrist
We fucking, I'm pumping, you know it's coming, bust in a couple of seconds
I'm sweating, I leave you slumped in the back of my truck, butt naked
Suck it out of me, I leave you with nuttin', get it?
This is what you wanted, this is what you came for

There's something 'bout the way you pick your cherries  (You blow me away)

[Chorus]
We can speed in my two-seater
Girl, I got a two-seater
Speed in my two-seater
In my two-seater

[Verse 1]
About a hundred on Fax and it's easy to stop (Yeah)
You see, my shit isn't stock
I used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls
But since I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped
But I can pay for them all
And by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball
E92, but '91 the year that Tyler was spawned
And if I crash, I'm owing wheels like I'm a Vaughn or a Vince, Tiptronic is stick
Or automatic, you pick, shit is static as shit (Yeah)
Sure my shit is AM, might get that X6 end
Don't follow exit him, might take a back street hidden
House got all sports cars like his garage is gym
Two sapphires on him neck next his precious gems
Not AMG, it's M, boy, I will eat him Benz
New engine, you got that old shit, your rims depends
Him got a warranty, don't care if him scratch him rims again

Sit in my passenger seat
You tell me I got too much speed
And I should slow, I should slow down
But I can't, 'cause you driving me wild
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes, it's too much
And you can feel the beat in my heart
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes, it's too much

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I know some dudes that would find you that carry rugers and shottas
And fucking shoot at your Honda, then fucking zoom out in Mazdas
Them GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonald's
Boy, I'm a king and I ain't lyin', boy, hakuna matata
Better watch for them hyenas, if you flex, then they swarm
They cashing so many checks, they're calling him Tyler O-Comma
I'm tryna ball like I was Domo O'Connor in '09
Or probably September...
Boy, I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals
Album cover looking like the mascot of the timberwolves, skate park at Pemberton
Hoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again
'Cause I killed the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman
Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland
By pounds, I mean in (*beep*)
Give it 'til he cop brick like a wall with pig in it
And money coming out the blue, like cops are changing fits or shit, I'm killin' it
Fuck!
[Verse 3]
Back when Left Brain had the hightop fade (Fade)
And we would go skate on them concrete waves (Waves)
And now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump
The beat thump, don't get it twisted, boy, my board's in the trunk (Skate!)

[Segue]
Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for, man?
Can you roll my window up?
Why? Damn!
'Cause it's windy
But I love it when your hair...

You can say you don't want to take that drive
But your hair, it blows

Oh, you the motherfucking man, huh?
Oh, you be fucking bitches, counting all the bands, huh?
Oh, you be trapping out the bando, selling grams, huh?
Oh, you be smoking, drinking lean, and popping Xans, huh?
You see, that's the bullshit that I don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas, y'all ain't fucking with me
See, I looked in the mirror and he said, ""You are the man""
And I said, ""Hey man, I agree""
Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects your personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the block, like I hate Legos
They know, they got thirty seconds; Jared Leto
Before they see some halos, and I reload the ammo
Boy, it's Golf Wang-o, and that's the squad I bang-o
Until my fucking brain go, now let's reload the aim-o

That boy not that bad, eh, it's no Biggie
It's the G-O, and the L-F, we go-go, no homo
We blackout, and go hard like JoJo and fuckin' Diggy
No ship in this series, since I pissed off Iggy, man (What?)
Been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Catch me in some Vans like one of them soccer mamas
And them bitches blue like that family went to a Dodger
Solve 'em (Oh no!) You can't bitch, I'm a problem (A problem)
And you'll get fucked up like the thoughts inside of my noggin (Yeah)
Going harder than the quidditch in Harry Potter
All my shows got one black in it like Larry David
And I'm that nigga, meaning I'm two niggas, I'm schizo (Yeah, uh)

Day that I met you, girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck, I can't sing, whatever, look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion began
'Cause I was at nirvana, but I had to pretend that I wasn't
[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, ""I don't know""? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Tyler, The Creator]
'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (For me, uh)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (No)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
A six-year Difference, uh
Is a ten year Sentence
And with the pigment on my skin

When you're thirty-five, I'll be forty-one (But you're too young)
And when I'm twenty-seven, you'll be twenty-one, yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run (But I know that you're young)
'Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo, this is dumb, you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself (I know that you're too young)
And mentally, you're older than me, and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help (But I know that you're young)
So when you mention ""hang"", I'm thinking 'bout a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation (I know that you're too young)
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention- (But I know that you're young)
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off (I know that you're too young)
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught (But I know that you're young)
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds, um
But I found my wings, fuck (I know)

But you're too fucking young

And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up

Don't be too material to see

They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me (Two, three, four)
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em (Two, three, four)
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me ""Are you still down?"" (Two, three, four)
Yeah, my nigga, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on (Two, three, four)
I know they told they white daughters, ""Don't bring home Jerome""
I am the free nigga archetype (Woo)
I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon (Ask the deacon)
It's funny, when you get extra money (Two, three, four)
Every joke you tell just be extra funny (Yeah, yeah)
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny (Two, three, four)
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me (Woo) (Two, three, four)
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up (Skrrt!)
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level (Two, three, four)
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God (Two, three, four)
He said, ""I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"", uh (Woo)
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks, got a trampoline in my room
Damn (Two, three, four)

[Part II]
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne, both]
Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it
Like I bet it at a auction
Been exhausted, I been workin'
While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers
Hold your fuckin' ponies, my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely, I eat pussy like Shoney's, yeah
It's Tunechi, homie, Master of Ceremonies
I knock 'em down, Domino effect, no pepperoni, I swear
It's them Golf boys, like them Hot Boys (Yeah)
For the nine-nine and two-thousand, but it's the two-thou' and (Yeah)
The one-four and the one-five, yo, what up, Wayne?
What up, Slime? Nigga, go hard
Yeah, I'ma go hard like before came
Got too much drive, need like ten lanes
Life is a broad, and she give brain
That's that road head (Yeah), that's a dream car
Got a full tank of that same year I was born
That's that one-nine-nine-one, 'nother nigga like I, you won't find one
'Cause, nigga, I'm a god, a divine one; Tune! (Two, three, four)
My trigger finger wise, but my .9 dumb (Yeah)
Middle finger blind, so it's fuck A-N-Y-one (Um)
Fuck, skate, and die son, a hundred ways to die, son
I'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut; eat up
I stick my Rollie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda, oh my goodness
Wayne, them bitches ugly, these niggas colder than Tommy buddy
Ye, we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel (Black ass nigga)
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling (Two, three, four)
Boy, let's get a scrimmage and cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German, you bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow and get bodies burnin'
'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon was
Fuck us, maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot, ugh! Son, you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset to go on tour with Yeezus (That's too harsh)
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchini
I know, it ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange, nah, faggot, it's Golf Wang386Embed"

Go reverse it, no rehearsin', gold is perfect
Open curtain, flow inversion, golden person
Yeah I'm nerdy, yeah I'm swerving

Your garden is full from raking these hoes
A handful of green and a couple of stones
Your lawn mower's foreign, you rent you a home
But nigga, how much of that shit do you own? (Uh)
See me, I don't compromise, I know my accomplishments
Fuck all yo compliments, bitch, I got confidence
I don't need your approval, my nigga, you suck
I do not have to adjust to stunt
Don't talk, don't jump, don't cheer bitch shut the fuck up
You're speedin' and gleamin' and stuntin', so Evel Knievel
You beaming and circle in Bimmers, you hoping them niggas’ll see it
Results may vary, my chain, it's not too heavy
I'll rather pedal smooth on my bike than to crash in that Bugatti
But back to the garden, niggas gon' do you dirty
Already started killing your flowers
It seems impossible, it's the new slave apocalypse
So sad and obvious
All y'all stupid niggas got the whips and no drive

You want the girls with the big butts
You want the diamonds, you want the stones
You gotta stunt on these niggas
Stunt on these niggas one time
Find your wings

Let's just run away from here ('Cause it's not, 'cause it's not)
Working out on Earth, my dear ('Cause It's not, 'cause it's not)
What you really want, girl (ooh)
My heart stops pumping blood when I see you (I see you, when I see you)
But I try to play it cool because (I like you, I really like you)

Girl, you're so special

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Let's move to California, right now (Pack your bags, go pack your bags)
I have wings on my back, so we don't (Take the plane, have to take the plane)
Girl, I know you ready, I can see it in your eyes
Boy, I know you're not, I can tell you're terrified
Oh, nobody has to know and if they did, they wouldn't care
When you rub my hands switching fifth gear (Wait)
Forget about it baby, let's not waste our afternoon (Forget about it baby)
'Cause we're gonna go fly to the moon (We're gonna go flyin' to the moon)
Yeah, but anyway (Pack your bags, did you pack your bags)

Suckin' on my ears, fingers rubbing through your hair
Fast wind, slow wind, fuck yeah, we behaving bad, uh
Probably couldn't tell but I be blushing when you with me
When you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my Jimmy
Oh, laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars
From my fake space fog machine
Laying on my arm, it's dead
From the pressure of your head
I said I loved you, said it back
Like it was scripted, but you meant it
Like the flavor of that lemonade
That we was sipping on our sushi-ridden dinner date
Oh, you think you special now?
Other bitches trippin' now
'Cause we're fleeing to the moon
Fuck Earth, man we sick of y'all

Bitch, fuck! (Uh, uh, fuck)
You have a question?

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
How many cars can I buy 'til I run outta drive?
How much drive can I have until I run outta road?
How much road can they pave until I run outta land?
How much land can it be until I run in the ocean?
Niggas go with the motions and all the plans
See, I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows, and posies
Fallin' outta my pocket, but y'all want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until they turn on the AC?
If the AC blow up, well then I'm TNT, I'm gone

[Bridge: Rex Orange County]
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out, out

Shout out to the girls that I led on
For occasional head and always keepin' my bed warm
And tryin' their hardest to keep my head on straight
And keepin' me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arise?
How many riots can it be until them Black lives matter?
Niggas click-clack splatter, (Pew) pew that nigga
Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull (Yeah)
'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool (Skrt)
'Cause I know what I'm drivin' is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one (Nah)
Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
Them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views (Yup)
Them views get some stares and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'Cause if them ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in

[Outro: Rex Orange County]
And if I drown and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I crash and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I fall and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
I'm wondering if I don't come back
Maybe then I'll know
Don't come back
Don't come back

Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Skrrt!)
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler the Creator]
I ride to California (Yeah)
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me (ayy, yeah)
Slick circles float roll
Out this world
Yeah, yeah

Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow (I glow)

But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)

Water your garden, my nigga (Stunt on these niggas!)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too (What the fuck?)
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning (I'm winnin', nigga)
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car

Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves

The boy drips swag like a broken faucet

With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him

To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way güey, boy, that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone

Shit

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues like how I ain't notice that? (Hey, how I ain't see that?)
Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuck in the cul-de-sac
I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help
But what you want for some, some niggas
Really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (Skrt)
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awkward
And I heard through some words that you're off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared
'Cause y'all throw so much shade (So much)
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump
Just let me know, my nigga

I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Snakes in the grass, but I walk
I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF
So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself
Than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, ""Fuck no,"" the next day, ""Okay""
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
Now keep it pushin', nigga
[Chorus: Jaden Smith & Tyler, the Creator]
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole

For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the garçons
Them feelings that I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase; ""poof,"" gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the beige tan
Polka dot nose, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float
But I was always like, ""Eh""
Barely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, ""Bruh""
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder, tryna
Grab the rings of Saturn, I'ma

I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?

Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time

Boy, I need a Kleenex
How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it
That I got this car, so I take the scenic
Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix
First, happy birthday!

Next line will have 'em like ""whoa""
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One me, two feet, three M's
Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized
'Cause Vans fucked up

Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada

And I just handle all my business like a chessboard

And at them Golf boys? That's my motherfucking set, boy

Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from a broad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And the bread orthodox like I eat kosher

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (That's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely (Woo)
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony (Woo)
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
My heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh (Hahaha)
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (Skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void (Void)
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (Ohh, woo)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes (Nah)
Like a vasectomy, what have I done? (Ohh)
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (Who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (Who)
The loneliest of them all (Me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit (-Posit)
Check in on me sometime (Okay)
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

Say some more, never want to talk about it
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, November...

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Take me back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November

Naw, take me back to November, wassup

Ayo, What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if ""Who Dat Boy"" is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes, fillin' his pockets?
And IRS show up asking me questions I couldn't answer
'Cause I was too busy tryna make classics
Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day-ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck?
What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck-fifty
What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across from Bank of America?
Damn, I would be hurtin'
Writing all of these songs 'cause Wi-Fi wasn't working (Nah)
Last year, in total, I put out two verses
But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh, is it really? Oh, is it really? Bitch, you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy, how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars, so what's their ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer, '06, I remember the... (horn)
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last? Let me pull over, quick

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin, Taco, Kilo Kish, Christian Clancy, Syd, Lionel, Vince Staples, Julian Conesugra]
My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November, and I was performing and Lil Wayne rapped with me, I think I cried that night
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was... my brother took me to my first concert ever, which was to Kanye West's ""Glow in the Dark...""
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance
The lyrics are—
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback

I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him

Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely (Woo)

Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony (Woo)
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago

You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh (Hahaha)
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (Skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void (Void)
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (Ohh, woo)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes (Nah)
Like a vasectomy, what have I done? (Ohh)
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (Who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (Who)
The loneliest of them all (Me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit (-Posit)
Check in on me sometime (Okay)
Ask me how I'm really doin'

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, excuse me mister, but can you please turn down the lights?
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga
I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special, the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego there so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime, brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school)
And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search Of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man, I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder
Than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada but let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named my album ""Cherry Bomb"" because ""Greatest Hits"" sounded boring
I don't like to follow the rules
She said that I must, I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk; ""Who's in charge of this Golf shit?""
I said ""Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick.""

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
God, goodness gracious
I can't wait to see the look on y'all niggas faces
That boy T nuts, surprised his thoughts isn't chafing
And fuck them crackers up at Mountain Dew, them niggas is racist
Cabbage was made, critic faggots was shook
So I told 'em that I'll exchange the word ""faggot"" with ""book""
And all them ""books"" is pissed off and had they page in a bunch
Fucking attitude switched just like a ""book"" when it struts
But I'm a fraud, I pray to God when the six triple ""book"" bashing
While me and my favorite author's lips tickle
Peter Parker pick a pack of peppers when the plot thickens
Tyler, The Creator fucking kill you with a popsicle
Cold blooded, so we rock mittens so they won't find him
Not kidding, keep the Tommy on me; bitch, I'm Ms. Pickles
Said I seemed off, last time that team talked
Sick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'Preme off
Should've bought some stock in it (Yo, it's fucked up, I get it, put a sock in it)
Not Golf when the little homies don't—wait, let's weigh my options
I bought me a mansion, and bought some attention
Ain't give none to Hopsin, and dear Boyce Watkins
Why you mad? It's the slave in me
It's facts, boy, I'm back like Rosa Parks's least favorite seat
Videos, stage dives, popups, they watching T
While y'all niggas watching the throne, the throne be watching me

You taking L's baby, hold my hand and feel like the wind, uh
Now fasten your seat belt, and turn everything off
I got your attention, motherfucker, I'm bout to take off
I'm the new pilot in this bitch
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip
But I do bring a terror like I hate America
A brand new camera and a parachute
Nigga, you and I are not the same, we not parallel
Don't talk to me 'fore I fucking embarrass you
Now sit your ass down, you doing three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up
Or you'll get fucked up

Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland
By pounds, I mean in (*beep*)
Give it 'til he cop brick like a wall with pig in it
And money coming out the blue, like cops are changing fits or shit, I'm killin' it
Fuck!
[Verse 3]
Back when Left Brain had the hightop fade (Fade)
And we would go skate on them concrete waves (Waves)
And now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump
The beat thump, don't get it twisted, boy, my board's in the trunk (Skate!)

[Segue]
Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for, man?
Can you roll my window up?
Why? Damn!
'Cause it's windy
But I love it when your hair...
[Part II: ""HAIR BLOWS""]

[Chorus]
Blows, when it blows
When your hair blows (When it blows)
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows, when it blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows (When it blows)
When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof

Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrrting on these niggas
Skrrting on these bitches
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo

[Bridge]
You can say you don't want to take that drive
But your hair, it blows

I know we'll have a good time
You just gotta stop being scared

Just come and roll with me

Oh, you the motherfucking man, huh?
Oh, you be fucking bitches, counting all the bands, huh?
Oh, you be trapping out the bando, selling grams, huh?
Oh, you be smoking, drinking lean, and popping Xans, huh?
You see, that's the bullshit that I don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas, y'all ain't fucking with me
See, I looked in the mirror and he said, ""You are the man""
And I said, ""Hey man, I agree""
Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects your personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the block, like I hate Legos
They know, they got thirty seconds; Jared Leto
Before they see some halos, and I reload the ammo
Boy, it's Golf Wang-o, and that's the squad I bang-o
Until my fucking brain go, now let's reload the aim-o
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Can't a nigga get some fucking chaos in hurr?
I'm the truth and the dare
And you can get your ass beat just like the kick and the snare (Ayo)
ScHoolyboy is my niggy, you know I'm good in the 50s
That boy not that bad, eh, it's no Biggie
It's the G-O, and the L-F, we go-go, no homo
We blackout, and go hard like JoJo and fuckin' Diggy
No ship in this series, since I pissed off Iggy, man (What?)
Been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Catch me in some Vans like one of them soccer mamas
And them bitches blue like that family went to a Dodger
Solve 'em (Oh no!) You can't bitch, I'm a problem (A problem)
And you'll get fucked up like the thoughts inside of my noggin (Yeah)
Going harder than the quidditch in Harry Potter
All my shows got one black in it like Larry David
And I'm that nigga, meaning I'm two niggas, I'm schizo (Yeah, uh)
Brim low, mind motherfucking been gone
Pink and yellow on my neck remind you of my dickhole
And I don't really fuck with you niggas, shout out to Jim Crow (Nigga)

See, that's that Cherry Bomb, get my burr on
That's McLaren, '91 out the Chevron

Pack a de la pistol, we splitting nachos, then for that cheese
Boy, he was using some shells just like a taco, so grab your goggles

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Day that I met you, girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck, I can't sing, whatever, look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion began
'Cause I was at nirvana, but I had to pretend that I wasn't
[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, ""I don't know""? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Tyler, The Creator]
'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (For me, uh)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (No)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
A six-year Difference, uh
Is a ten year Sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another Statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love

And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God, yo)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Toro Y Moi]
When you're thirty-five, I'll be forty-one (But you're too young)
And when I'm twenty-seven, you'll be twenty-one, yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run (But I know that you're young)
'Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo, this is dumb, you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself (I know that you're too young)
And mentally, you're older than me, and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help (But I know that you're young)
So when you mention ""hang"", I'm thinking 'bout a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation (I know that you're too young)
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention- (But I know that you're young)
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off (I know that you're too young)
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught (But I know that you're young)
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds, um
But I found my wings, fuck (I know)
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Charlie Wilson]
But you're too fucking young
I really like you
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
I don't know what to do
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
Funny thing about this is, by the time you hear this
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)
It won't even matter, I'll be in the clear, haha
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young, ha

Boy, I know that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy, I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

[Verse: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I'll exit and wait a while
Just say the word, girl
Can't you see the answers are all there?
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you, girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all, baby, it's just you and me
[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin’ hurts
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young

Your garden is full from raking these hoes
A handful of green and a couple of stones
Your lawn mower's foreign, you rent you a home
But nigga, how much of that shit do you own? (Uh)
See me, I don't compromise, I know my accomplishments
Fuck all yo compliments, bitch, I got confidence
I don't need your approval, my nigga, you suck
I do not have to adjust to stunt
Don't talk, don't jump, don't cheer bitch shut the fuck up
You're speedin' and gleamin' and stuntin', so Evel Knievel
You beaming and circle in Bimmers, you hoping them niggas’ll see it
Results may vary, my chain, it's not too heavy
I'll rather pedal smooth on my bike than to crash in that Bugatti
But back to the garden, niggas gon' do you dirty
Already started killing your flowers
It seems impossible, it's the new slave apocalypse
So sad and obvious
All y'all stupid niggas got the whips and no drive

Stunt on these niggas one time
Find your wings

What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga, fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out in Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called ""Pink Dolphin""

Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush

But it was my first official date so I was stuck, like
It was past curfew, and we was at the Grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something
All I remember was your motherfucking face

Making eye contact, I feel like the damn man

I'm insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance

Sick to my motherfucking tummy (To the left)
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy (To the left)
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me halfway, bitch I'm going all-in
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco

So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet (No homo, too soon)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be

Wait a Goddamn second
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham
Would fall 'cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a Goddamn speaker
Any time you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the goddamn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure

Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting
""Dad"" isn't your name, see ""Faggot""'s a little more fitting
Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare
You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs
So you not being near fuckin' fire-started my damn career
But fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see (fuck you)
A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you
But sucks you ain't give a fuck and consider a sperm donor now
Fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
And I just ain't being passive, nigga

Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic
Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it
Supposed to be gone 'til November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgia
I'll call her number
But she won't answer

You claim to hate my fuckin' guts
But say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding
And, if I got stranded, had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off saltwater and fuckin' coconuts
Phone ain't got no service, this 3G is fucking worthless

You'll be fuckin' nervous like me inside of a church is
But, I'ma get in contact regardless, and

Ton of drums, with foul flow, dirty mouth, like kissing bums
Mama done made her one, um, a witty son
With no respect for women, so show me your titties, hun (What?)
You eighteen? Me? I'm twenty-somethin'
Okay, I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit, it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, ""Should he come?""
I'ma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, um, that mac and cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics (""How's your dick?"") Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee (Damn)

Crack fucked up the world
And I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era
Who made a lot of money off that shit
And I wonder if it fucked with they conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from

[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
Forty-eight, forty-eight, forty-eight states I get it in (Nigga)
Forty-eight, forty-eight, forty-eight states I get it in (Nigga)

Shit's getting warmer, on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother's a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you're accustomed what you're used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating, I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it's all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
You can, blame me, motherfucker
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tucked
Didn't realize this game fucked, up some lives
Oh, how's mine?
My conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that, I'm fine
I got a little money in my pocket

You become the go to guy, you know, forever
Next thing you know you're in too deep
Way too deep, it'll scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death

Went to Six Flags, six fags came up
And said ""Ayo! Can we get a pic?"" I said no
And they said ""Oh! It's Wolf Gang, ""Yonkers"", Goblin is my shit though""
Now I'm like, ""fuck, I don't want to be an asshole""
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, ""Hey, Tyler, can I...?""
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
""But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard ""Radicals,"" the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song ""Bastard"" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, ""Fuck, is he speaking to me?""
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to ""In Search Of..."" and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like ""fuck""
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a ""hey"" (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play ""VCR""
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...""
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
""Yonkers"" and ""Yonkers"" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about ""Yonkers""
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
""Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say ""Sagan Lockhart"" and when you came out to ""Sandwitches""
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started""

Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking

And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your headlights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Mmmm it’ll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)
Where the street lights trail (My baby, ride for me)
You ain’t gotta lie to kick it darling
It’s cool we’re moving slow

Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?

I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled

Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you

Geek, fag, stupid loser, find a rope to hang
I'm not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names
I wanna tell my pops but, shit, he'll probably say the same
Fuck...
Hated by everyone, that's the way it seems
I don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self-esteem
I sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone
'Cause none of the cool kids would let me join a team
Depression's on the stalk again
My best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck
'Cause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see I know better than to show my face
Around them, but the day I do, it'll be everywhere
When I share these feelings finally, they gon' fucking care
[Hook]
Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple (Planes, planes, planes)

So I'ma **** her and toss her in the principal's office (Tyler, I'll go with you)

Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid, but I'm growing up, so they're missing
I didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army
I'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me
Mama, I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?
I don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home
And I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
And I... I hear helicopters, make 'em dip
I'm fucking reloaded, I told you all that I ain't taking shit
You better back up before this Mac start to lift up
I'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up

Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister (Uhh)

In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, ""Fuck shit""
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese

Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, ""Hi,"" I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the ""Tron Cat"" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Um
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
She thinks you're getting cash, no, bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait, turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nig​ger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned
(I'm just fucking around)

[Chorus: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!

Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing (Uh)
Then he has to deal with me and my minions

Have you heard ""48""? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do, I go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease, bitch!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down, I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare
On the same damn bus like, ""You're going to jail now""

How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well, if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me
Tryna set mood, little RedTube, fuck lotion
I don't need lube, dry fist suits me (Yeah)
Up and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound

And before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me

Mama got the Rover with the Range (Yeah)
She don't ever, ever gotta struggle, not again (Wolf Gang, nigga)
And I put that on my dead grandmama's name (Rest in peace)

Uh, my nigga Slater, yeah, that's my little pony
Little homies is repping like I been fucking with Kony
Nigga, Phillip and Kobi, to my niggas that know me
Your boy seem happy as fuck, but truthfully, your boy lonely
Nigga's a target for marketing, he's an artist
Can't even walk into Target without bothering customers
Bothering, asking me for a picture, can I talk to they sister?
Nah, nigga, get lost, you're fucking smothering
God, I wanna quit, but I can't
'Cause mother and sister can't pay the rent
Four stories with storage, I'm twenty-one with a mortgage
And touring's paying the bills, life is paying for thrills
Life's a bitch, bruh, but from the third floor, man, she's gorgeous
A year ago, I was broke; now, how can I afford this?
I started off with disposables; now, I have an assortment
And I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait
Now, the frame is a pain in the ass
To get it in without a scratch or stain on the glass, but that's not important
Just as long as it's printed, and I hinted it is
But when I get it, I'll make sure you get a copy, you bitch
Shit, I'll even add a signature with the fuckin' pic-a-ture
I'll even tell you the film I used, and the aperture

Uh, Grandmother died, didn't cry, not a tear
Not gonna lie, fucking weird, no water dripped out the eye
But when I got the news, yup, it left your boy stuck
'Cause when my mom dipped, she was the one that gave me a fuck
Mom calling and calling, I'm on my way to a show
I answered, she crying, saying, ""Sadie is dying""
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak
Before she deceased, 'cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
Fuck! Nah, this is really awkward for me, bruh
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back
And started to think, like, ""What the fuck just happened?""
I never had a death, and I just seen her a week ago
Meet them at the hospital, I should
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD
Lionel asked what happened, I said it's bad, bad, not good
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood
Getting there, family sitting center chair
Awkward in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there
There's her room, open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, ""Hello""
Our conversation's brief
Couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
Lookin' at her, you could tell all she had was weak
And I'm not talkin' days, bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strength
I sat there, twenty minutes tops
Hoping it was just a fucking plea that she could cop
She died that night
[Outro: Dr. TC & Tyler, the Creator]
Oh, that's heavy, man
I'm sorry for your loss
Yeah, whatever
Don't worry about it...

You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone. You don't, you don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on

[Verse 1]
I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted tellin' people he's bumpin' all of my shit
These motherfuckers think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jackin' off and proceedin' my life careless
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
Philly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy
A couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?

[Interlude: Tyler The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
""Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual""
""Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied""
""You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine""
""I try too hard, huh?""
""No, you don't""

Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set
Nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group (Yeah)
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make ""Parade"" or ""Inglorious""
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
""Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?""
""I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that.""
""I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now.""
""Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at  home?""
""What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?""
""I have, I mean you're a great person.""
""I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?""
[Verse 3]
People excited, thinking shit is so tight (For what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)
Fuck that, (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (I love that shit) of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it, (They don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
""It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that ""faggot"" word, that's very, that's a bad...
""I'm not homophobic.""
""I mean, I don't think you are but...""
""Faggot.""
""Alright, well, since the last time we...""
""The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can.""
""I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just.. I mean, they're really random and it's ADD.""
""Who doesn't have ADD..? Well, I don't.""
""I mean, sometimes, you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?""
""I wish Thebe was here.""
[Verse 4]
Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion
You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47
At 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned
(I don't think anyone's going to men—I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)
College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit (I mean, you...)
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I...)
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
(So, what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (No, you don't)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gon' take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
(I believe you) All you fucking lames don't have to like me (Yeah)
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee

This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn

They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again, another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit

Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (Denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (Black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (On the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (Brown cock)
Last night, I slept over hers (Over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now, she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude
[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler, The Creator]

See you in the dark when you're sleepin' (Ooh)

And you touch yourself after hours (Ah, ah)

I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See, when I'm with my friends, I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time

Goddamn, I love women
Daydream about penis being in 'em
Meet them with a big grin with a MAC-10
Rope, katana, and then I skin 'em
All beige suit made out of white women
With the red lipstick, dancing to John Lennon
With the red splattered jeans made out of blue denim
They can catch me in the spot where the sun don't shine
Bitch, don't mind me, shake your hiney!
The only motherfucking Wolf here that spit venom
You're a bad bitch with a real good kitten
And I got the appetite of them fat black women
Wolf Gang in this bitch with a bunch of rats with 'em
Lookin' like the holocaust with Supreme hats with 'em
I am tryna get Miss Piggy by the motherfucking hairs of her chinny-chin-chin
Umm, what's that? The cock of a black dude
Mad 'cause his daughter got the swag of a vacuum (Aw, fuck it!)
I'll take her to the back room dungeon, fightin' and punchin'
And now the slut is under the fucking assumption
That I will be fucking and munchin' her muffin
Cunt will be bleeding, but that's not from the

And make me and the Wolf Gang sandwiches

Keep yellin' and workin' them vocal chords
And that'll be more of a reason that you get slapped up for
Is that Ford trunk's comfy? (Fuck you!)
Fuck me? No, fuck Buffy!

Jumping over gates, what the fuck she want from me?
She keeps sendin' me garlic
How many times I gotta tell her I'm allergic?!

Bitch, I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood Target
Fangs are sharp, and I hope you know
That all I really want from you is that throat
I can't eat pussy 'cause I might leave cuts
Then there's blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus

So, you tell me that everything just isn't going well
Well, first off...

[Verse 1]
My only problem is death
Fuck Heaven, I ain't showin' no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missin' a neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead
[Chorus]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare (Nightmare)
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair (Fight fair)
My spirit floats around in the night air (Night air)
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems (Death)
I told her I'm her worst nightmare (Nightmare)
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair (Fight fair)
My spirit floats around in the night air (Night air)
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems (Death)

[Verse 2]
When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm gettin' older, gettin' bolder, but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk drivin', lap's full of Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me—
I'd have a better chance of gettin' Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker, get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a lil' darker

[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Tyler, here's some water, man. You, you seem a little tense. How's, uh, how's Thebe?

[Verse 3]
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up
That's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my lil' brother growin' up
Feel like my lil' brother missed his brother growin' up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growin' up
I got a lil' taller since the last time you seen me, bruh
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pourin' up
But I never had a drink— (Sydney, Tyler's throwin' up!)
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feelings I be feelin' when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm
As emotionally straight as Travis when he—(Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5"", about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming, ""O.F. is the best""
The other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to tellin' my mom shit (Why?)
'Cause I don't know how to (Whoa)
All I want is her support, but no (But no), it's the fights at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed (Now she's really fucking pissed), so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack
For the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like his house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watchin' Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends that
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
""Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat""
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back
[Chorus]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare (Nightmare)
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair (Fight fair)
My spirit floats around in the night air (Night air)
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems (Death)

[Verse 4]
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm goin' in flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
'Cause I'm 'shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me 'cause y'all know that
We at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)
Nigga, get off me (Calm down, man)

[Outro]
Fuck off me, man, fuck (What's, what's gotten into you?)
I don't, I don't know, it's, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (Yeah, you)
It's like I got a fucking voice in my head
Tellin' me to do all this fucked up shit, man, fuck (Yeah, what's, what's this?)

He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do (What's his name?)

La-la-la, la
La-la-la
Ah

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator & Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Satan's gettin' jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferrin' us
Books on not givin' a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us (Bitch)
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead, I rap about fucking bitches and gettin' heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby (Ah)
I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhymin' pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours (Umbrella)
I hate this, screamin', ""Fuck patience""
Got a nigga shakin' like the calmest, fucking Haitian (Ha-ha)
After chronic masturbation, askin' where Mary Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick (Hate dick)
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She runnin' 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose (On God)
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one (La, la)
Honey on that toppin' when I stuff you in my system (La, la)
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome (La, la)
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressin' pourin' out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler, The Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands (Bitch)
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's tryin' to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleadin' squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex Mix, she bleedin' from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirrin' ruckus, throwin' sets up, yeah (Wolf Gang)
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin (I hate you)
Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossin' the border (Arriba)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
'Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus daughter (Fuck Mary)
I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starvin' Nigerian kids barfing (Blegh)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playin' leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, ""Yeah, Bob, this nigga's sick""
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead (Skinhead) since India Arie (India Arie)
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said ""Fuck coke"" and now I'm snortin' Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket (Casket)
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out, ""Fuck faggots""
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

[Verse 1]
She lives next door
To the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text I get pissed when I get no reply

[Chorus]
(It's this girl)

[Verse 2]
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beatin' Richard up
To mental images—her face look
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on Facebook (This girl)
Video chats are so exciting
'Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy (Yeah)
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate (Arg, it's this girl)
I see her in class
Not really, two doors down, but anytime that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, ah, my shit's getting hard

But all the bitches they fuck are known as bitches and sluts
But she's special
I know, to y'all, I come off as rough; but I'm the nicest to her
And I just want to concur, a relation
I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharing straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holding hands, walking home
I look past that, the fact she's fucking guys that I hate, but

[Verse 4]
Things are looking great; cut, copy
Last time we talked, she said that her relationship was rocky (Action)
Now that Mr. Faggot's gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy (Girl)
Next day, metro's taking me home
I see her in the cut at Wendy's, she's not alone (Fuck)
Who's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her? (Shit)
Come to find out, she got back with her nigga (Damn)

She's so pretty
Fuck self-pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
But if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile, I know
What do I do with myself?
Sit in my room for some days?
Play Xbox with piles full of wet socks? Fuck that (Girl)

[Verse 6]
My nigga ask, ""Ace, what happened to such-and-such?""
I could slander her name, and then tell him I probably fucked (""Yeah, I fucked"")
Or I could tell him the truth, and just say she ain't like me much
But instead, I lie, and say she moved to Nebraska

Fuck you think I made Odd Future for?
To wear fucking suits and make good decisions?

[Verse 1: Tyler]
Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck
Who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that john
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 401ks, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen DeGeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming ""fuck you""
I got ten of these Kennedy's
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery
'Preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks
Surprised she hasn't taken gymnastic dick inside her alley-oop
The Golf Wang hooligans is fucking up the school again
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again

You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle

[Verse 1]
Slip it in her drink, and in the blink of an eye
I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin' and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go

Bitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill

Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)

While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool

Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming

Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean

Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can’t get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you

So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause

This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she’s a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'

[Verse 2]
This little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

[Interlude]
Now, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch, y'all? (That bitch she boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')

Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic

Tyler, we, uh, I, I know it's short notice, but I, I, I brought all your friends here
For some reason, I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends here to talk to you
Because they're, they're really worried 'bout you
And I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme, I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the skyline
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind, I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get the picture now
Thirty-thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus, another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out

[Chorus: Domo Genesis]
Where we at? Where we at?
Where we at? Where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?

And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back (Wolf)
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs (Ah)
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Bimmer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several, but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says ""Fuck 'em"" on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter, that's where I'm at (Where we at?)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Now, where we at? Where we at?
Ah, Wolf Gang, where we at? (Wolf Gang)

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell, yeah, I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates, niggas let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might give you nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix
Me, your bitch is comin' along, yeah, she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream until it has an abortion
[Chorus: Hodgy]
Where we at? Where we at? Where we–
We on top of the world, on top of the world
Nigga, top of the world

[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seein'
Now, I bet they see that we ballin' like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane?
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stay in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world sayin' every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know

[Chorus: Mike G, Tyler, The Creator]
Where we at, nigga? Where we at, nigga?
Uh, we on top of the world, on top of the world
Where we at, where we at, niggas? Where we at?

Where we at?
[Verse 5: Tyler, The Creator]
Down to fucking Earth, huh? Down to fucking Earth, huh?
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth, Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying, ""Fuck everybody,"" I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book, and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home, but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do, Clancy and David are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully, I make a lot of porridge from tourin' in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully, I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but they're complaining, making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
""Can we get backstage, man?"" — No, faggot, it's sold out
""Come on, why you holding out? I thought we was boys
Without me, you wouldn't be Tyler, The Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change its spots""
But I'm a fucking unicorn — ""Whatever, man""

[Verse 6: Tyler, The Creator]
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full Monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach, ""Fuck age, live dreams and have fun""
""Here's some 'Give a Fuck' cake"" — Oh, maybe I should have some
""Asshole, have none""
How can I wake up on the wrong side of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
(""Shit, I don't know"")
And when I'm on that stage, I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
In school, I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero, and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah, rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building

Tyler, you obviously have some fucking problems
And, this is, this—, this is the end of this session. Let's—, anything else you've gotta say?

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & Dr. TC]
Mom is getting jealous, I see my manager more than I see her
Before I go on tour, and it hurts (Yeah)
I miss the days when this was fun, but now, it turned into work
And getting legal, so I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out (As you should, that shit's outrageous)
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids who copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling 'til my mo'fuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets dis-gur-sting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck (I'm here to talk to you)
I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant (Who, Travis?)
Niggas saying ""Free Earl"" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing a new album; I'm missing my only friend

[Interlude 1: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
You have everyone around you
You have thirty meetings a day
I don't see what it is
I mean, you— you act like you don't have anyone to talk to
I'm here for you. I'm your friend
When I say, ""Odd,"" y'all say ""Future""
Odd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit's corny as fuck

You're doin' good, you have a cult following
You're— ""Yonkers""...

Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nauseous with the Nazi, but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen, with a La-ti'
So while my wallets piling with symbolic-colored paper
I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
Twenty, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably 'cause that motherfucking embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy-winning, schizophrenic fucking orphan
Oops, I mean ""Bastard"" (Yeah), skinny-ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her master's
Son lies about taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard (Yeah?)
Start a fucking cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fucking shitty article in Thrasher

[Interlude 2: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
All right, just calm down
That ain't shit, man
Now, don't— don't— don't make yourself feel guilty
That— That article was great
No, fuck that, nigga
You're beating yourself up, and you're living the fucking life right now, kid
When I was your age, I would have loved to be fucking doing the things that you're doing right now
Fuck that, fuck all this shit
You—, you—, you act like I'm not here
You're not
I'm exactly who you're supposed to be talking to

Fuck you, fuck, you
Who wouldn't—, who wouldn't shoot their friend?

That's fine, it's not your fault
I killed my fucking friends, fuck (We're gonna need security in here, and, uh)
Fuck, I didn't fucking sign up for this shit (Gonna need something to calm him down)
I'm— I'm not fucking crazy— I'm a fucking table
I'm a fucking table (Yes, come quick, he's losing it)
No, fuck this shit
Tyler, calm down
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Dr. TC]
I'ma grab the Nina (No) and find a nice arena
'Cause I can't even choose between Ortega or Sabrina (Get security in here)
And I'm not even human, I'm a body-shaped demon
With some semen in my sack, and some problems in the back (Calm the fuck down)
And a life that's fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that's filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one (No), like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse
And the parents of the one that's getting married has a curse
And it's made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse, but wait, it gets worse
All the guests that's in the church all decided to disperse (Tyler)
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse (You don't want to do this)
So they tied the knot; now it's too late to reverse this arrangement (Yes, it is)
And the nurse is amazed at the hurt that he was pained and (Calm the fuck down)
But it was obvious in all the photos he was painting
Now, a bunch of whispering immerse

[Interlude 3: Dr. TC, Tyler, The Creator, Security Guard & Nurse]
Yeah, he's right there, security's right there
Shit, no, get away from me
Get him (And then, the nurse blurts)
Come here
What the fuck is his problem?
Here, we have two doses to give him, here (Why didn't anybody ask him first?)
Get on the ground
Hold him down
I've been asking you this whole time, Tyler
Get the fuck away from me, get away from me
Come here, motherfucker ('Cause nobody gave a fuck)
Get the fuck off of me, ugh
[Outro: Dr. TC]
Someone gave a fuck, Tyler, and, uh
The person that gave a fuck was me
See, you're not going crazy
It's me, I'm your best friend, Tyler
I know everything
I know everything about you
You've been helping yourself this whole time

Deep thought I'm often lost in (Fuck it), put me next to awesome
Still can't tell the difference, just like Asians with their eyes shut
Butt fuck a couple Rots in the Wendy's parking lot
Barking at the sight of light from my bright sparkling
Cock-a-doodle, eatin' toaster strudel
At a nude beach in Rome, in a black Bape spaghetti strap made of Ramen noodles
My bitch is bad, mixed with a thicky ass
Get my dicky rocky, this will end up in a sticky blast
Chrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass
Life's a bitch, fuck college, mommy, I am ditching class
I rather be happy than fucking forty
So fuck that teacher's lecture, I'm having Sydney record me

Rollin' in a golden Tacoma, the shit's stolen
If that bitch tell on me, I'ma do a fuckin' drive-by in her colon
With my meat, gotta keep it obsolete
Like Chris Brown when Rihanna got her fuckin' ass beat
Fuck Jeeves, ask me for advice, if I'm not reading a Vice
I'm squatting down, picking cracker bitches' scalp for some lice
Everything that I write is dope, because the pipe, and nope
You can't have a hit unless you give me the light
We be burnin' Dutty Rocks with a light switch
Bitch-nigga, you're about as hard as a dike's clit
I'm going as hard as Bishop Eddie Long's John
After I bought a Sidekick and sent that fag' some nice pics
They say I try too goddamn hard
No shit, I want a Grammy you damn retard
You can't be great when you settle for a flea bargain
Unless you're a thrift hipster bitch in a leotard
Painless, Hodgy lost his motherfucking mind because the brain left
Wolf Gang got the ink on me now it's banged out
Box Logo hoodie, still haven't got the stains out
Congress, I guess I'm fuckin' with the best blondes
Um yes, I am now beating off to mom sex
Raquel is wrestling a prom dress
While me and Ray Charles have a fucking staring contest

[Chorus]
To all the stepdads in here
Trip-six kids got you motherfucks scared
It could be worse, nigga, that's absurd
Nigga, I am at Pharrell's tryna butt fuck nerds

This just in, Tyler the Creator and Justin Bieber
Was just in the room flippin' Selena Gomez
Go 'head, give some, pucker up
I'll fuck her up until the kids come in, um
After Tron Cat, I got the rat shook
And I ain't even have a hook
For the white kids to sing along
I don't wanna sing a song, fuck that
Now cyberbully sissies on my lil' sister's Macbook
I got you niggas nervous like a Pop
Tryna ask his virgin, hot, vegan daughter where the cock goes
Wake up, wash ass, go and eat some Roscoe's
Head back to the studio to munch up on some tacos
When I was younger I was bitchin' and
Now I'm coming quicker than
The shit that's swimmin' in my sock hole
When them teeny boppers ain't around
So Johnson and Johnson baby lotion
Beat on my Johnson 'til my cock swole
Stop saying you're sick, shit is kinda old
I'm a fucking Herpe in a coma, you're a common cold
Have you heard my brother' verse on Llama?
When that nigga's home
Me, him, and Hodgy gonna take the game and
Get a stainless steel AK and aim it
To the fucking referees head and put his lifeless body in a chokehold
Uh-oh, these niggas is loco
Best thing smokin' minus all of the tobacco
Still hard to be black, well
Malcolm X would be proud, this white bitch getting black-maled
Blue-eyed cracker named Jenny, and skinny
And Obama wanted change, I threw a couple fuckin' pennies at him
[Verse 3]
Just a chip off the old block
Chipped tooth Ruth got some dick off my swole cock
'Cause I bag bitches, she's a zip off the old lock
And that's just a logo on the center of that old Glock
Oh stop, tryna be me, kids will go cop anything
That I put on, from the gold watch to the boxers that I put on
Probably 'cause I'm going harder than erect cock dick filled with Botox
Oh shit, you're as hard as senior citizens dick
Oh fuck, don't slip, break hips and pop backs
Show some respect to old chaps with my left fist
'Cause I'm the next best spitting wreck that's left here
That's my ex bitch, her? She's my next bitch
Have you met her mouth? No? Oh, that's my bestest
Bestie, and she gets beastie
And she's my favorite babysitter 'cause the children never exit

[Outro]
I was taught to act my shoe size, I'm eleven and a half
Cock the umbrella 'cause when I spit Seven on your ass
It's gonna be mid-stage Coachella
Shake faggot ass keep hatin'
But I work hard for the shit that I got
So it's still fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Planet Earth

Yo, yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-Slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album
[Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower, so-

[Verse 1]
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat
My father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son

[Verse 2]
My mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important, I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple, but probably not, fuck em
See Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $188You might also like[Verse 3]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

[Verse 4]
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

[Verse 5]
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made ""Sarah"" to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep
[Verse 6]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

[Verse 7: Tyler, The Creator, Dr. TC]
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

[Verse 8]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it
[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

[Verse 9]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

[Outro: Dr. TC]
Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?105Embed"

I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders
I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent
At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxing at Happy Camper
It's the fucking (financial aid) at Hamptons wasn't relaxing, I'm taxing
""Fuck 'em all!""'s what I'm chanting, don't complain, I'm just ranting
Fuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot
I'm a liar like Carrey in Liar Liar
I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott, cable guy like Larry
Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies (Fucking fairies)
I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitch teeth paste
Fuck it, Odd Future some Nazis (Nazis), black Nazis don't copy (Copy)
We perfect, you sloppy (Sloppy), hotter than Saki Takei (Takei)
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett (Bitch)
Hang with thrashers and jackers, drug dealers and crackers
AP students and slackers, I'm backwards
Like Jermaine Dupri in '93, escaping from concentration camps
With a fucking girl board and a ramp
That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress (Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress, bitch)
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker friendly
White red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie
She dino like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me (Yup)
Fuck You Bunch is here, never disrespect my family
That’s for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie (Auntie)
Wasted fucking youth? All you old niggas antiques
We go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from Randy
Bitches like Tia Landry watching Billy and Mandy (Watching Billy and Mandy)
Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be (Can't be, heh)
Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot (Faggot, ayy)
I guess I got to be a fucking hand-me-down rapper
From Los Ange' area anytime I'm fucking landing
Fuck (Fuck) 2DopeBoyz and NahRight
Shoutout (Shoutout) to Hype Trak, them motherfuckers could never get rid of me
Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy
Get these fucking hip-hop bloggers to start feeling me
Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fucking skinny jeans
And follow in your footsteps like a motherfucking millipede
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and ciga-weed
Jerk with my freshmen like it's some motherfucking little league
No, I'm not no fucking hipster, mister
No, I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies (Fuck buddies, O-F)
Yo, yo
I'm driving in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fucking drunk
Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk (Uh!)
My nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked
(Shut the fuck up!) Who the fuck told me not to spoke? (Me)
Fuck everybody here, everybody vanished

Hello, the hype is so mellow
Bitch, I'm dope, but my pipe is so yellow
The blue polka dots, pink stripes, and it's pink on the title
Nigga, fuck your role model, bitch, I'm my own idol, and
If you can't face it, my nigga, you can ass it
My accessorized accessories bring out my assets
Nigga, this sound on acid tablets
Stussy’s G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses
I suffer from ADHD
I should win a fucking award for being me
Beat banging, the tom-toms
My produce selection is fresh, nigga, fuck Vons
Ace the underdog, throw them on the back bender
'Cause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender
Eating Belgian waffles with Italian biscotts
I sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off
And to you emo kids who walk around pissed off
Step One: Pull your panties down and start to piss off
Step Two: Run to your radio, turn this shit off

So when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me with Gucci belts

I'm opening a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin
And fuck Mary in her ass— Haha, yo
I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest
In the three-bear house, eating they motherfucking porridge
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour in my basement
And keep that bitch locked up in my storage

If this was a game
I already know that I would come out winning
And I'm not bragging, I'ma be in her
But this bitch really think that I'm 'bout to buy her dinner
My steak good, I got a good cut like splinter
Juicy and hot, such a Black-bitch temper
Now she wanna talk and chop it up like a blender
But I don't give a fuck or even list-en like Schindler
She's cute, but her forehead's big
Got stretch marks like she got four kids
Her legs can't close like the four-doorhinge Bronco
That O.J. killed the white whores with
A wealthy white girl without the facelift
Lure her with expensive dinners and a nice bracelet
Leave the bitch breathless
What the bitch don't know is that I'm a mothafuckin' sellout and a rapist

[Chorus]
Baby, you're an angel
How about we turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know you're dead
Ironic 'cause your lipstick's red, of course
I stuff you in the trunk, drunk
'Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow
And snort

If this was a game
I would be considered a motherfucking legend
And I ain't trying to gas you like Chevron
But I'm high as fuck, bitch, you really need to get on my leverage
Now, we're in the cabin, in the middle of (""Uh..."")
Tryna find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet
Dreamy little bastard, I done ran out of luck
So now, it's time for a bloody foot, you little rabbit
You're very attractive
And notice that my hat is always the color of cactus
(And I hang with wolves) 'Cause I'm an evil bastard
Pictures of you on my wall
No glue, no tape, but just cum, plastered
Met you at my school, departed at my house
Ended at your panties, started at your blouse
Pushed you downstairs, I took a nap up on the couch
(*Snoring*)
If you wanted a date, don't come
Now, you gotta make it easy for you, don't run
You call this shit ""kids?"" Well, I call these kids ""cum""
And you call this shit ""rape,"" but I think that rape's fun
Wait, now it's about eight-something
It's late, and you stuck down in my base-one
Come downstairs with nothing but a shoe-string
Yeah, bitch, this date's done
[Chorus]
Baby, you're an angel
How about we turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know you're dead
Ironic 'cause your lipstick's red, of course

Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
I was taught to act my shoe size, never my age
I always judge a book by the cover, never the page
I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage
That he felt when he dealt with the physiological phase
They say that I never cease to amaze
While half my mental belongs in a cage
The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch
If you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit
Selling my assets
I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest
But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of possession
She showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
The pigs fly away in the morning
But I ain't get to see you today
And if I want to go outside
I got to make sure that I can play here
I bet you've never seen a pig fly (Nope)

I bet you've never seen a pig fly, nope
Right next to the fat lady hitting high notes
Went to sleep at seven never woke up from the dream
Wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme
So I guess that's where I hide my things
Caged, and the wonder is seen
Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck
I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck
So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities
Hoping that maturity won't be too mad at me
But if so, I'll take the scorn, indeed happily
Long as I can feel my heart tap like Happy Feet
Fatherless kids, orphans like me and Domo is
A fuck that we will never give is like our pops
But what we did was found our niche and made a stitch
Just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit, that's from

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow
The therapist said hello but my mom would wonder
I was dealing with iller shit like professional plumbers
Like food for thought was my father but I ain't have the hunger
My self esteem was like me, tall and full of flaws
My pride is gone, I'm that guy like Aaron Hall
Shit, I know some niggas wear their hearts on they sleeves
But I wear mine on my head, Supreme

Make their feets get wet and funky up in they under arms

With the exclusive on the channel, bitch I know it's on

Suck a dick, eat salaam getting they nails done in salons

If you talk shit, I'll make you cry and tell your big moms
I got nice hands, niggas eat out my big palms
Haters must be starving nowadays, I make California Vietnam
And I'm going to embalm my creativity
Into a CD-ROM, so you can feel this shit I'm on

Bitch, reach for the door, get your access denied
I'm not an asshole, I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming ""Tyler, stop!""
The big bad wolf; to me, you're just a minor fox
Red Riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock
We the niggas you scared of like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit
Your whole gang'll be diminished, bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenant's daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it

I can’t read!
Yo, I'm gonna throw up, I got 5 on it
I got 5 on it too, my nigga
You smoking, my nigga?
Nah, I ain't smoking
Come on, nigga, just hit the fucking—
Nah, you know I don't smoke
This nigga never want to smoke, my nigga
I'm high off life, nigga
Straight edge ass nigga
I'm good man
If you ain't gonna fuckin' smoke nigga, then just rap for us, nigga
Aight nigga, I got this
Yo, yo, look

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat
Pro-abortion, anti-clean rap
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found
Where the black girls get their weaves back
Awesome I achieve that mini, blasting ""You're a jerk""
In some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot
Bouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead
I like my girls smart, skinny
Kinda pop tart, when I bite into them red
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots
My hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem
With the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant
I'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent
A lot of fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed
That I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring
I'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever
So don't ask for no mothafuckin' ride when you see us
Swim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew
'Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
The shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you
Kill the jungle, let the cats loose
You didn't see me here if someone ask you

That nigga got off
Hodgy Beats, haha
Ayy, ayy, tell them niggas too

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I want to feel her in every way
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day
Bong, vaporizer, in the sack now
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
She ain't got time to try and relieve ya
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa
[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
I'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables
I'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals, woah
Let's take them high like the decibels
So we get them high, get them high like cholesterol
In a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber
That's fat, who needs another producer?
Chica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo
'Cause I ain't really care what the rest say
Type of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape
Best stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes
Best believe I'm leaving with more of those
And I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying til the verse end, FIN
[Interlude: brandUn DeShay]
BrandUn DeShay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator
Odd Future, O.F. until, until... from now until forever, Peace
[Verse 4: Mike G]
We grind, these niggas asking for some promo
We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos
Square circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit
Preaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet
No less profit, fiened when we drop shit
Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split
It's that crack, give you something to sell
Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail
Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell
And she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel
Light skinned women, all sex everything
Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything
Everything that we call flight, living life
This is everything that they call hype
I'm everything that they call nice
She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right
Intimidated by niggas you can't be
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see
Top ranked, number one my son
And she looking for them trees, baby we got some
And stay focused on the women and you get less done
It's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one
Them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high
How high? Nigga, higher than the kites they fly31Embed"

[Verse 1]
I like my girls skinny with brains
I like my hoodies fucked with Lame
I like my friends imaginary with no names
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce (Damn)
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello (Hi)
I want to eat you out like jello
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom with–? (Nigga, hell no!)
Fuck (Shit!) and another one, there goes another one
(Fuck... O.F.)

[Chorus]
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Well maybe Cupid won't miss (Blaow!)
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Well maybe Cupid won't miss (Blaow!)

Maybe? (No)
Maybe? (I'm sorry)
Maybe? (I got a date)
Maybe? (Where's your dad?)
[Verse 2]
I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went

[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator & Sarah]
Tyler, what are you doing?
Shut the fuck up!
Uh-umm…
Shut the fuck-, you gon', you gon' fuckin' love me, bitch
Uhh…
Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head
Mmph!

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator & Sarah]
But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake I would eat and your toes
'Cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me
I'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch (Someone help me!)
Now this shit is turning to a habit
I'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way
And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
L-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'
And I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role
Climbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath, I would never get over you (Help me! Help me!), ever, Sarah
[Chorus]
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Well maybe Cupid won't miss (Blaow!)
(Maybe) Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Well maybe Cupid won't miss (Blaow!)

[Interlude]
You're my lady, you taste so good (Oh no!)
You're my lady, be my lady (Oh no!)
You'll be with me forever (Oh no, blaow!)
I love you, Sarah (Oh no, yes!)

[Part II]
[Verse]
Half your body laying on my chest
The rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast
And I'ma just take another guess
Now you probably wishing that you would have said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe
But fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck
Your family looking for you, wish 'em good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody
And I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy
Looking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?
[Refrain]
What did you want from me?
What did you want from me?
[Outro]
(Police!)
I gave you everything
(Police!)
But, I guess I wasn't the one
(This is the police! Open the door!)
I don't know, I don't know
(Open the goddamn door! We have you surrounded, motherfucker!)

Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking sergeant
Nigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive
'Cause I get it, no charge
And BBC for the low price, no barging, nigga that's a bargain
Cow-print t-shirt like motherfucking dog
On the motherfucking farm with cockadoodle doodles
I'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle
And my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles
Felines on the free time, I'm tossing bitches' salads
And I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan
We was flying to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok
Until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock
To Soho, Baby Milo so dope
The cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane
Niggas get the picture, I see, why?
They don't paint pictures, they just trace me

My hat is in tact with the Fubu pull over
Nigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range
And I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange
And I'm the only fucking rapper without a chain
With a four-finger ring like I can't spell my fucking name
And I go to Obama rallies screaming out ""McCain""
Them ignorant, thrashing motherfuckers is my gang
And the dirty Ladera, I can't forget where I came from

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
My father died the day I came out of my mother's hole
And left a burden on my soul, until I was old enough
To understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much
He loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he... (Shake Junt)
Bring Your Pops to School Day, for twelve years, I cheated
Told the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meeting and
Bring That Dude to Life day, he wasn't at the meeting
Made a U-turn on the way there like, ""The fuck am I thinking?"" (What?)
Birthdays, Christmas, my only fucking wishlist
Was CDs (And a father) and a new fit
Instead, I got some CDs, inhaler, some Ritalin, some white socks
I was hyper 'cause I ain't get attention from my real pops
Cops say I'm supposed to be in jail, but they don't know it's me
Statistics say that niggas with no father ain't gon' be shit (Nigga!)
Well I guess I had one, 'cause, nigga, I'm it
You smell that? (Yeah!) That's the odor of success, bitch

'Cause she's playin' both roles, like her occupation was dyke, fucking right

I look up to the Hugos and Dixons (Yup)
The niggas in the vision, rap about the shit they cooking in the kitchen
Pushing keys, like them niggas that were banging on them keys
My father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie
He bought me a hoodie, a couple albums
Like that's gonna make up for the years and the tears
And the money that my mama spent on rent and clothes
You fucking dipped out, I swear to God, if I see you I'ma get out

'Cause in 16 years, you let your kid doubt the existence, none

I'm not the only fuck without them
How to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed
Up, take it to the shop, then, what?
Fuck it, momma's proud of her asthmatic, thin fuck
Luck on my brim, Sup-preme keeps me warm
When the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer
The bummer is the fact that I'm black
And I hang with white Neos whose marrow stays frío

Ugh, yeah, how you doing today?
Ugh
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah
Ace, The Creator, man, look
Casey Veggies, uh-huh
Odd Future, look
Look

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Hello, the hype is so mellow
Bitch, I'm dope, but my pipe is so yellow
The blue polka dots, pink stripes, and it's pink on the title
Nigga, fuck your role model, bitch, I'm my own idol, and
If you can't face it, my nigga, you can ass it
My accessorized accessories bring out my assets
Nigga, this sound on acid tablets
Stussy’s G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses
I suffer from ADHD
I should win a fucking award for being me
Beat banging, the tom-toms
My produce selection is fresh, nigga, fuck Vons
Ace the underdog, throw them on the back bender
'Cause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender
Eating Belgian waffles with Italian biscotts
I sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off
And to you emo kids who walk around pissed off
Step One: Pull your panties down and start to piss off
Step Two: Run to your radio, turn this shit off
Nigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help
So when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me with Gucci belts
Gucci imprint from leather welts

Uh-huh, Odd Future, nigga
Get used to, ugh
Let me—Aye, I'ma slow it down right quick for you
Look

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm so dapper, man, funky-fresh, Dapper Dan
I'm your favorite rapper, fan, it's an honor to shake my hand
On award tour, on excursions
I'm a virgin of swap meets, I'm so pure, so sick, it's no cure
I'm dope, where the fiends at? Aight, where the jeans at?
The hat, the crew, the T-shirt is Supreme
Ugh!

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
And they see me, they play ""Pictionary""
I got a good way with words like a dictionary
And in that dictionary, my name is by ""Fresh""
They at the same spot, they making no progress
Becoming a good rapper ain't that easy of a process
Ear-gasms, they have them
The hotels we staying in twelve-star
Tyler said, ""Yo, Casey, just write a twelve-bar""
If I'm with twelve people, I'm with twelve stars
You haters put up your guards
They against us? Oh, no
Red and white diamonds, Supreme, box logo

Her-Herpes On Her-Herpes On Her-Herpes On Hеr Lip

90 percent of you niggas want this beat, 90 pеrcent of niggas want this beat
But I won't give em' meat, Because when I see them they look like
My mothers feet, and that's a bunch of corn, I'm a horndog
You should meet my dad he always feed me a corndog, No homo tho'
I have a Louie Vuitton dildo, with Bathin' Ape Camo

[Verse 2]

Most niggas think I'm redundant
'Cause I like to take my shopping sprees out in London
I go to the can, I go shop in Japan
A diamond black card, I get as much I can, man
My seven chains seem so real
Imagination changed all the way that this feels
'Cause it's soft
Ice creams and dunks
My girl rock Louis Vuitton pumps, you ask how much it cost
My nigga, I go hard
I rock Goyard, Supreme, oh god
Thought I had to wear black just to kick Bush
Until a mechanic button pushed me just to kick push
Niggas know I'm a teenage millionaire
Got polos to match every color Care Bear
I get fit with Ralph Lauren, white tees is boring
That's why I rock the best, my nigga, get fresh

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm color-coordinated
Get fresh
They're not color-coordinated
They need to get fresh
We is color-coordinated
It's fresh
(Ooh, yeah)

Yeah, all white polo, self-titled jeans
Philiano Burtono, dog, own everything
Your boy Philiano is OTC
And at it's worst, I shop out this country
Your boy Philiano got his own clothing
What's the name of it? It's named after me
You ain't gotta stay tuned, this ain't a cartoon
Somewhere far, Mr. Burtono is coming soon
Red, white, blue, that's so fresh
Black on black, you look like a mess
The sunny part about it, I'm so funny
Yeah, I'm so fresh to death, I sweat money
I love it, chillin' in the public
Three hundred bucks for the Rockin' Republics
I don't know, but I'm not the best
I stay, I dress to impress, but just get fresh

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm color-coordinated
Get fresh
They're not color-coordinated
They need to get fresh
We is color-coordinated
It's fresh
(Ooh, yeah)
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I go to Beverly Hills for perfection
Just so I can scope out the new Polo Hansen
My own clothing gives me an erection
I like to jack off to my own clothing
Nigga, check my wallet and see how much I'm holding
A new Bathing Ape t-shirt I'm unfolding
Cuffed pants, blockhead main attraction
With my jeans, now I have a creative reaction
All my jeans get ripped up from my crew
Probably 'cause my new purple label look blue
Orange, yellow, green, pink, I got fits
My closet is thicker than silicone and Lil Kim tits
And as you can tell I'm on a mission
'Cause I got more True Religion than a Christian
I'm rockin' in public, Banana Republic
You rockin' Akadema jeans, I'm rockin' Rock & Republic (Yup)
Paper with O's on the check
T-shirts with V's on the neck
My flow is sicker than AIDS patients havin' sex
And you know what's next, I'm one of the best, yes
I'm not even gonna tell you the rest, my nigga, get-- fresh
(Ooh, yeah)2Embed"

'Sup, you bitch-ass niggas?
Niggas-ass bitches?
You ugly motherfuckers hanging out this summer?
It's your boy, Tyler. But I'm going under a new name:
Stankdaddy. (DJ Stankdaddy!)
I'm just here to fix this shit I listened to in the summer
Hopefully you mothafuckas like it
If you don't, too bad
We gonna start this mothafucka out slow
Got some heat and some bangers, some classics
Some shit you probably never heard before
Hopefully y'all like it
Skate to it, smoke to it
Eat some stolen barbecue to it!
Y'all mothafuckas be safe, let's ride this mothafucka out
Summer Camp Mix

Knock-knock, mothafucks, it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga, fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out in Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called ""Pink Dolphin""
I roll here on a mean unicorn
Green hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform
Downing that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up
Something like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause

I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Verse 2]
When you're alone thoughts start coming in
Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about (RIP)
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ayy?
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy
[Verse 3]
Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
So I don't feel bad when they not eating
(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)
Wolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman
I'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca
If you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then

[Skit: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC, Sam, and Wolf]
""Hey...""
""Bitch.""
""I'm right here.""
""Yo, who's that..?""
""That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?""

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Outro]
This was the original.. I just didn't.. feel like putting it on the album, but... I hope you like it..
I am the cowboy on my own trip

Geek, fag, stupid loser, find a rope to hang
I'm not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names
I wanna tell my pops but, shit, he'll probably say the same
Fuck...
Hated by everyone, that's the way it seems
I don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self-esteem
I sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone
'Cause none of the cool kids would let me join a team
Depression's on the stalk again
My best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck
'Cause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see I know better than to show my face
Around them, but the day I do, it'll be everywhere
When I share these feelings finally, they gon' fucking care
[Hook]
Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple (Planes, planes, planes)
Then, gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga
I said it's us, nigga

Murder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you
Was when I... (""Uh"") with all them burners, you
Think that I'm some punk bullied bitch who ain't gon' trouble you
Well, I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you don't mind
Umm ""Who are you again?"" I'm Samuel and that's Tyler
We came to get wild and style in these trench coats!
Don't start asking what's packing in these trench coats!
Just know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats! (""Umm"")
My step-father called me a fag
I'll show him a fag, and I'll light a fire up in his ass
And recently, them assholes been fucking with me in class
So I'ma keep them muhfuckers there and make sure they pass, huh
My prom date, she dismissed my offer
So I'ma **** her and toss her in the principal's office (Tyler, I'll go with you)
Oh, now you wanna conversate with me, try to be my friend?
(Where are my parents at?—) Don't worry, you'll probably never see them again

Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum, hehe
We are the Sams, and we're dead—it's just four of us
We come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious
We took their heads, but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours...

[Verse 3]
Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid, but I'm growing up, so they're missing
I didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army
I'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me
Mama, I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?
I don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home
And I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
And I... I hear helicopters, make 'em dip
I'm fucking reloaded, I told you all that I ain't taking shit
You better back up before this Mac start to lift up
I'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
The difference between us and our class is tan khakis
I got ninety-nine problems and all of them's being happy37Embed"

Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D. (Star Trak)
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit (What?), now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Me? I'm from the slums, niggas who push a ton
Ton of drums, with foul flow, dirty mouth, like kissing bums
Mama done made her one, um, a witty son
With no respect for women, so show me your titties, hun (What?)
You eighteen? Me? I'm twenty-somethin'
Okay, I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit, it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, ""Should he come?""
I'ma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, um, that mac and cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics (""How's your dick?"") Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee (Damn)
I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touch a bag of weed (Word?)
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, ayy
Getting T.U., O.F., indeed
We was missing Sweatshirt, like ""Where's the hooded sleeve?""

Pipe

[Verse]
How could you not see the germs?
Don’t fuck with brownies from the trap, they make my tummy burn
I burned a eighth of sherm, stopped at 76
Came back with a bag of chips and some gummy worms
Fuck, left my lemonade on the countertop
This shit is fight, pound of whop that I’m hitting up
Dude I found a pipe, fuck a blunt, stop the twisting up
Fuck, I need a light, where’s the matches? Hurry, listen up
Growing up, they said we wasn’t missing much
But a Philly blunt in a bag and not give a fuck
When it comes to green shit, I don’t lack at all
Known for keepin’ swish but I really hate basketball
Some might say the boy’s amazing
Eyes low, red, looking like a sad Asian
This new shit hits like Jet Lee in a awkward situation
On a mofo, nig​ga I’m faded
Long story short this hits hard
Hi mom, thanks for the Wingstop gift card
See I’ma call you later, well, if my shit’s charged
I’m playing iPhone DJ in my bitch car
Bong rips iced when the glass out
Pack the gas masks full of hash until I pass out
Cigarillo, or Mr. Twist ostimo
Looking like a smoke shop, twinter than the window
I don’t even know, but I’m just spittin’ and I’m faded in the gated
Looking like the fucking gated community
And *gibberish*

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Hey Dad, it's me, um...
Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son
Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting
""Dad"" isn't your name, see ""Faggot""'s a little morе fitting
Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to sparе
You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs
So you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career
But fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see
A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you
But sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now
Fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
And I just ain't being passive, nigga
You a fuckin' faggot, nigga
Got a show on Monday, guess who ain't gettin' no passes, nigga?
But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga
And call him
I hope he answer

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts
Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic
Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it
Supposed to be gone 'til November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgia
I'll call her number
But she won't answer

'Cause when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
You claim to hate my fucking guts
But say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding
And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts
Phone ain't got no service, this 3G is fucking worthless
Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a Church's
But, I'ma get in contact regardless, and
I hope you answer

Nigga close that door, I'm that goddamn boy
You a telescope, nigga I’m a goddamn star
You could watch me all you want, bitch I'm goddamn far
These goddamn bars the reason why I got that car
My life sweet like a Kit Kat bar
You ever seen a four-sided triangle? Nigga I'm that hard
Pause, oh, y’all
Fuck that shit, Golf Le Fleur, Globetrotters I'm the goddamn sarge
Nigga, who the fuck got me? Franklin Ocean, Rocky, Taco
Ghandi prayers couldn't stop me
I ain't really into y'all energy, into goods, into cars
Still don't believe that I'm into boys
Flow like menopause, did that hit over here, over there
My thoughts are darker than Senegal niggas
Pissin' off all of y’all, fuck ’em then
Everything I spit was heat, bitch I'm lickin’ char
Jerking off, is he cute? Pick a charge
Amex, pick a card, big garage, pick a date, pick a car
Catch me in a fucking droptop with the heater on
In the seat beside me occupied with a Nia Long
We be countin' stars, baking cookies and singing songs
I put on some Kelis, I guarantee she gonna sing along

Yeah, something I don't understand (Woo)
I know some guys from the roots of this shit
Who ain't congratulate me on Grammy
Nigga, I thought we was family
That small cut hurt me deep
Like paper cuts on my hand from counting this cheese
But I'm still human that cheddar don't really mean nothing to me
I got feelings, I don't be in 'em
I don't feel blue, this ain't like denim
But I like shorts, that's how I tell them
I address it, and then I move on
Like a mailman, on my two wheel
With the pegs in and the basket, for my baggage
And the gold frame when they tryna paint me as the bad man

[Verse 2]
They'll call you trash 'cause you tried
Same ones they never tried shit in they lives
Niggas will watch you and watch you take shots
And tell you, ""you missed"" from the side
But that's 'cause they pay attention
And they mouth is gettin' for the mention
Words don't hold no gravity to me
I ain't flyin' in they solar system, listen
Why you shoot your arrow? (Arrow)
And aim it at my head? (Aim it at my head)
All because you scarecrow (Scarecrow)
And you ain't move your legs (You ain't move your legs)
I won't get complacent (Complacent)
And say ""it is what it is"" (Say that ""it is what it is"")

And I'm feeling bigger, man, these niggas on wars
Got my ears to the street, white noise too loud
Got it in the pillow if it's going down
Heater under pillow, knife in the drawer
Niggas like, ""what for?"", motherfucker, paranoid
I don't trust nobody, not even my mommy
Abracadabra, go ghost on you niggas
And I know that I got it, I don't boast on you niggas
I don't respect y'all, no, I don't toast to you niggas
We don't get the same bread, no, yeah, ho
They gon' get you if I said so, so, there, ho

[Verse 4]
Bitch I got the fuzz like kiwi
Lime Van belt, nigga, I don't do DB
House on the motherfucking hill like a key
You need a hike boot just to see me
Little silk scarf, crazy with the tie
New le FLEUR* dots with the daisy on the side
You can't get 'em, we don't want you in 'em
Better go and get the little swag off Hidden
Y'all be one oakin'
I be French chokin'
Crock on the cardigan, crock on the Cartier
Strap look pink like strawberry marmalade

I hate the word urban the Grammy's would say (Yeah)
They unplugged that controller like, bitch, I'm not playing (Woo, woo, woo)
I brought all my brothers, I felt like the Wayans
I keep who I fuck on that low like I'm Zayn (Yeah, yeah)
Hit Henry Taylor, might ask him to paint 'em (Yeah)
Slow on that BMX, ride like the phantom (Woo)
Y'all trip they follow, I feel like the mayor
Come back with a warrant, I want all the paper (Paper, nigga)
Been growing my hair out, I don't want it faded
Growing too slow, I've been patiently waiting
Been thinking about transplant like boys feeling daisy
Don't ask 'bout my niggas
Don't ask 'bout my lady
Ask 'bout my status, I don't want it stated
I'm private like prisons
I don't see no ceilings
I get on that stage and the building start flaming
I look in the mirror like ""Nigga, we made it""

Fuck with me, fuck with me cause' I'm so advanced

Fuck a trap house, need a summer crib (Aye)
Couple deer and a chandelier, where my mama live (Huh?)

I be up early at these meetings, on my comma shit (Took a bag, nigga)
Y'all be ridin' waves, I'm in a scuba suit
Globe-trotter waterproof, I know what time it is (Uh)

Let 'em know that you gon' pay that back (Pay that back, nigga)
And let 'em know that yo' bill fucked up
And let 'em know that you get fucked up
Because you scared, you gon' go right back
To that place that you just came from
Because the numbers that you see, man, they don't add up
And all them niggas that's around are some loser ass yes-men
Waste of space niggas and they know it so they just act tough
To justify that you need them around
But them hotel rooms and plane tickets, man they all add up
And who gon' pay It? Yo' dumbass, bruh
You feedin' grown ass men, you need some whole ass friends
This brand new one that got your best interest, that you trust (But)
Homie, when you grow up, they panic then say you switched up
Because they scared and do not wanna find a mirror (Look at theyself)
And deal with the fact that you gon' see a little clearer
Which means they could potentially get left out of the picture (Uh)
But I'ma leave it there, cause' that's for you to figure

I'm in your room now your screaming for help
Anxiety attack so you piss on yourself
And you pray to god that one of your neighbors can help you
But that won't happen I'm helter skelter
In my lobby, they can't find me
I'm not a maniac, i'm a zombie
I'mma rap about some neo nazi
Bitch you better call on God or Gandhi
Better hope Jesus come baptize you
Because I'm about to come rape or sodomize you
Keep doing that until I realize you
Dead from the sound boom when I pound you
I'm a night stalker, catching bitches walking after dark in parks
Hit that corner, then they're gone
They can't call for help because I took their phone
Using up minutes, use them to call my homies just to tell them that I'm in it
Bitch I dare you to scream
Haven't you heard of Sarah? That's me
I made that bitch my milk tits
I was dressed up like Lisa Simpson
Put her to sleep, quick in my hilton
Now I'm bout to change your name to Ruth Wilson
Voices in my head like kill them
Amityville insanity pill
I can't swallow my cavities
They're strictly from these casualties, that's really good with ham and cheese

Into me talking about sun rays with you

I'm in your room now your screaming for help
Anxiety attack so you piss on yourself
And you pray to god that one of your neighbors can help you
But that won't happen I'm helter skelter
In my lobby, they can't find me
I'm not a maniac, i'm a zombie
I'mma rap about some neo nazi
Bitch you better call on God or Gandhi
Better hope Jesus come baptize you
Because I'm about to come rape or sodomize you
Keep doing that until I realize you
Dead from the sound boom when I pound you
I'm a night stalker, catching bitches walking after dark in parks
Hit that corner, then they're gonе
They can't call for help becausе I took their phone
Using up minutes, use them to call my homies just to tell them that I'm in it
Bitch I dare you to scream
Haven't you heard of Sarah? That's me
I made that bitch my milk tits
I was dressed up like Lisa Simpson
Put her to sleep, quick in my hilton
Now I'm bout to change your name to Ruth Wilson
Voices in my head like kill them
Amityville insanity pill
I can't swallow my cavities
They're strictly from these casualties, that's really good with ham and cheese
Load them up on Craigslist

And if you on your paper chasing, I’ma roll with ya
About an onion, it odors a bag of Funyuns
Bitches packaging dozens, fuck ‘em until they malfunction
I laugh my ass off, taking shots like a gunman
I don't hunt game, motherfucker, I hunt men
Take ‘em to the back of my pick-up truck to rot them
Kill a fuckin' superhero, I watch the Watchmen
I’m a super-negro, my watch the rocks in
My Glock that's cocked, loaded, and ready to lock in
Who's sending niggas to the dirt? Ostriches
Captain holding them captive fucking hostages
Create carnage from cartridges, eating the heart of pigs
To murder, homicide's a part to live with that
Grab your Teflon, ammunition, and your gat
Unless you wanna get shitted on like porn scat, oh!

Yeah, my niggas skate, but we don't roll around the rinks
Bitches be going down like the bowl inside the sink
The pride disappears like a cola diet drink
They want me in they system at the same time, jinx
I give one the website, she punches in the link
Last name longevity, my riddles don't shrink
I'd rather poke you than stroke you and choke you
But you're a singer, bitch, it will fuck up your vocals
You’re great at interviews that may higher promote you
On worldwide postal to what ocean flows you

I'm on a fucking unicorn with a horn that's blaring
Dare me to start a bar-fight with Cyclops that's staring
I'm fuckin' high off Flying Guy, must I brag about my high
Hi Mom, I'm fine, I'm doin' normal, I'm chillin hormel
Formal, way I play the keys, colors comin' out the speaker
And every time I speak, I get weaker
The beat high off Spaceships and Bliss, acid trips, bring a friend
I'm the Captain Crunch, rapping punchlines, slappin' sluts
Orgy with the mermaids, laid out in a studio
Upload this shit to MySpace and watch all the weirdos go
""I been to that place that he talkin' bout, in that song""
The Leprachaun is mixin' up, to fix it up, I'm fucked up
Off the reverb, we heard that shit from a mile away
I cannot even see my feet, I'm floating on a fucking cloud
Wow, now they carry me, angel wings with my name on it
I don't get it, I'm a demon, fuck it, give it here, I'll pawn it
And prolly some more, I'll overdose on chlor', into the floor
Or I could go buy some bliss, but that's priceless nowadays

Good morning, America, good morning to Erika
Good morning to Ashley, who always harass me
To all of my exes that sendin' me texts-es
When I'm in the bed with my other next bitch
My lovely, she's so tan, you love me, I know, man
Hey, you wanna hold hands like this was a slow jam?
Good morning to blank, I won't mention ya' name
You gave me ya' brain, so good morning to frame
And good morning to me, I'm on top of the world
And good morning to haters, I'm on top of ya' girl
Good morning to luck, 'cause I'm rolling the dice
I'm Domo Genes', so wave goodnight to ya wife
Good morning to models, good morning to bottles
We all drunk, and we turnin' this shit full throttle
And I'm takin' off, so we flyin' tonight
No more livin' low, goodbye to that life, uh!

Bitch that broke my heart that I could really care less about
Good morning, Milan, good morning, Raquel
Good morning to the devil in the deep depths of hell
And good morning to the A.P. class I failed
And all the drug tutors that tutored my brain so well
The feeling's amazing, and no words can explain
The feelings that I feel, like Phil Collins stuck in the 80s
Good morning to the bitch father I never had
In vocab', excluding the word ""Dad"" in my pads
Good morning to the kids that wanna shoot up they school
The next morning, it’s okay, I encourage, it’s cool
The dream state I’m in is like digging your nose
But I’m not digging for gold, I’m digging for some shit

Live for the moment, here, you can hold it
And if you're broke, here's your atonement
Good morning to limelight, cameras, they shine bright
Picture after picture, what you do for this Klondike?
I mean, for this kind' life, this feeling is so tight

The exes and tantrums, the bitches and stressing

With a couple extra dollars in my pocket to play

Good morning to the love, make a toast to the breakfast
Good morning to the bitches that just wouldn't accept it
What up to the twins, I ain't seen y'all in months
When I finish this song, we gon' roll up a spliff
But I don't smoke, so I guess I'll watch y'all pass up the pref'
And I could listen to this shit and just get high off the piff

Stretch marks on her nipple and welfare
With a different color weave in her hair
Pussy smell like, uh... a Cook Out

I just wanna hope everybody had a good holiday
Got- we got Christmas coming up, hope everybody spending well with their fucking family motherfuckers
You know, I don’t got no motherfuckin’ family, I was adopted twice
So, my uncle molested me when I was six

The only girl I ever loved
Fucked some nigga that I really hate
And the funny part about it that we didn't even date
But at the end she could still say she got her pussy ate
Yummy her in her tummy, pour out cause
Cummy in her bummy means that a little me being coming
So I let her blow my flute and start humming, bitch's brewin'
But that wasn't bubble gum that she was chewin'
Our relationship was like my music, chopped up, screwed up
Made her sick threw up, I gave her everything that wasn't enough
So I put two up, I'm hot, she cool, I call it a blue crush
We fucked, no kiss, that's it, fuck love
Snort drugs, make songs, go skate, daily life
Sarah or Dorothy, which one to make my wife
Or maybe I'll just marry both of them bitches, maybe twice

[Hook]
I was in love, but fuck it

[Outro]
Dorothy, my everything
She was my everything
Sarah, I love you

She ain’t got the fattest ass, but she got the baddest assets
And she give good brain to pass them AP classes
And through these glasses, she the baddest (Bad bitch)
And now I’m the gladdest, when I get her at night like Gladys
And I for a fact know, that I love her more than a tad bit
I’m lyin’, Sarah still made me the saddest, bitch
My heart engine was the fastest, and that bitch crashed it
Robin Williams could not patch it (Nope!)
Played me like a lottery, the one with the scratches
A love locked down with the latches
Could never brace a nigga down, I broke them brackets
Was on the runway like fashion, we fucked with passion
Fuck you, bitch, I got my car fixed, and now I’m smashin’
But really, my engine works, zoom, keep flashin’

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay, Syd]
Uh
Wow, I must've lucked up
'Cause my life was a mess, just clusterfucked up
You know in furniture stores, the hoes spill with the fabric samples?
I wish that I could show you how I feel, but
I told you how I feel, I think I'm in love
From a nigga so small like a sink in my tub
She busted out laughing, ""How you think this shit up?""
I said ""Well, the key is really not to think much""
And then we linked up, now a couple months passed, and
Time's going to waste like crumpled up trash
I just get nothing but flack
""I swear you should’ve been a Ford car, how I maintenance yo’ ass""
High maintenance, my ass! I wish
You would've put your turn signal on before you turned into a bitch
Thought we was good to go, but you was running them red lights
They said love was blind, I got caught in yo' headlights, dead

I like my girls skinny with brains
I like my hoodies fucked with Lame
I like my friends imaginary with no names
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce (Damn)
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hеllo (Hi)
I want to eat you out like jello
And mеss with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom with–? (Nigga, hell no!)
Fuck (Shit!) and another one, there goes another one

But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake I would eat and your toes
Cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me

Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch (Someone help me!)
Now this shit is turning to a habit

And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way

Yeah, I fucked up, no blue and no red
Can’t look up in the sky because the blue is dead
I met her with white, dated her with yellow
All started when I said “Hello”, said that I was a fine fellow
I’m hype, she was mellow, like taking Prozac in the dark

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
Cause I’m a piece of shit, it ain’t that hard to fuckin’ tell
Blogs say I’m the shit, but I can’t detect the smell
Haven’t tried to be successful, cause I’m afraid to fail
Wearing all yellow, now I'm praying to the Devil
And I dig my own ditch and I brought my own shovel
Carvings on my arms, fuck lame on my wrists
And nobody gave a fuck, I thought Sarah would give a hint
Fuck Commercial, my show would never be a hit
But I have dreams of being able to fuck every bitch
That could breathe, that got knees, with a twat, I myself
Fuck a chain, fuck swag, fuck a prop, period
Make my own rules, fuck a cop
You niggas with these one-sighted visions, cyclops over my blocks bridging
Stitching up Sarah name like it was my cling to fame
In retrospect, O.F. is a fucking game
We terrorizing old folks, smoke, skates, rape sluts that chew dick
Run around, grab a new inhaler like I’m not sick
But I’m not bitch, counselors tell me all my issues like I’m not it
Demented, in my own dimension
Couple “Fuck you”’s and donuts is my division
Chopping up my wrist with incisions, no second decisions
Creator of shit with no inventions, look
Tryna get the heavens to listen, but I can’t
Because I’m my own fuckin’ religion
And they think I’m tryna be different
But I don’t give a shit like sitting down pissing
I’m a black panther in white skin, like a lesbian who like men
Fuck friends, I don’t even know how to begin
Well this is the beginning of new ends

Fucking Opposite Day, yeah, my heart beat slower
When we would hold hands in the back of lawn's mower
The blood pressure going to my penis got lower
Like the scores of some nigga kids testing for diplomas
Dreams about you spitting like a llama in a fucking Odd Futurama where your last name would be Okonma
And where you deepthroating different pieces, I'm sorry
But my fantasy is sicker than a herpe in a coma
This is what I'm known for
Ready? (Uh) We can get it hot and sweaty like a musty toaster, and the posters of you on my wall with the mouth cut out
So I have paper cuts on my balls by the fucking time I pull out
Life is what you should doubt, 'cause if I can't have you in the right way
I'm going left, and I doubt that that's a good route
Pleasure's either or, so if you're not a whore, it's no worries, I can kill you and masturbate with your blouse (Scream)
Go ahead, scream, shout
'Twas was the night before we made love, not a creature was breathing, not even a damn mouse
'Twas was the night before we made love, not even a damn mouse

[Interlude]
(Scream)
Alright

[Verse 2]
Hello, I'm Wolf, not even on any raping shit, 'cause there's a million fucking ways that I can make you take this dick
Make you sick, and force you in a long term relationship
And with that said, let's begin with head, you brainy bitch
Three sixes like Gacy Dick diary, I got a bunch of kids aspiring to be an atheist
I'm hiring a bunch of fucking demons to do crazy shit
It's tiring when all these fucking Christians are just hating shit (The irony)
Um, what's to live for? Ten whores?
Canon cameras to film hardcore porn in the back of Supreme Stores?
Skateboard with four more niggas in the same shit?
Cult lead this earth, with the same niggas I came with
Bang with the Wolf Gang, fuck trust, because in the end you'll find out you've all been fucking the same bitch
And that's life, motherfucking thrust her shit
Life's a bitch, I'm just trying to find a trunk to lock her in

Hey! What's your name? Oh, that's nice
Me? I'm Wolf, you can call me Tyler though
I'm eighteen, you from around here?
Oh, you look like my next victim
I said you look like my ex-girlfriend, sister

[Verse 1]
While James is jamming on the mixer
We can play Twister naked
Don't be afraid, it's just a kiss
I'm open to everything if you're inviting your sister
That's another topic, we should start a project
You could be the lab rat, I could be the doctor
Let me drug you up and put different things in you
But I'm not gonna do that until you begin to pass out
Now I can draw your face up pretty
Or do it jackass and leave your breath all shitty
Or I can get the hand held and hold held titty
And stick my dick in you but that just might offend you
Teenage parties, I recommend you
Never get drunk with a nigga like us
But I kinda like your company
And you rubbin' on my dick, yeah, it comforts me
Fuck, condom pocket, luckily, I brought one
Herpes virus, yeah bitch, I fought one
I don't want you to have my permit yet
That I just haven't came up with a name yet
I got some new shit, well technically, I got a new dick
The other one fell off in a pulpit
A gay coaches' white grease and Chris Stokes
Blew the fuck up in gray clouds of thick smoke
Funny, right? Ha-ha, this shit's jokes

Well, I have a gram cupcake mix
Mix a little syrup, it ain't no way to cure him
But I don't do the syrup, I just do the sniffles
Take a couple bits, bitch kibbles, bitch I gotta riddle
What can you tickle that can make a dinosaur giggle?
I'm tryna get your puss, your pimple is a push
Away from the tush, I don't smoke kush
I don't do drugs, I don't even club
I don't drink beer, why the fuck am I here?
The girls are really cute, but they're on X
And that's a better reason to for me to take advantage with sex
And you might be next, you pass out on me
Your mouth drool, throw you in my van, now it's carpool
Let you rest your ass on my dick like a barstool
Going deep like a scuba with the snorkel
You never gonna forgive me, but you're so damn pretty
I'mma drop you off home quickly
You passed out, bitch you ain't even listenin'
And leave your house empty, your neighbors didn't see me
You're never gonna get me, your self respect were skimpy
You was up thirty, now you're down fifty
Abracadabra your memory I'm tricky
You are what I rob so I guess your pussy empty

Kissin' every little bitch, coming home with fever blister
Seventh grade, mom payed la tierra
I was amazed, I was bullied by faggots, they bang
Eighth grade I was jackin' off chronically
Dick swollen honestly, to this day astonishly
Richard Henry Dana, I was bangin' from the alamo
Ended that shit, I won my Eighth grade talent show

Ninth grade, I went to fuckin’ fag academy
For math and science, yeah, they hated me
Straight F’s, failed tests, future, man I failed that
Fuck that, fourteen, hormones in full effect
Tenth grade was a wreck, Hawthorne was a breeze
Popcorn, all D’s, show no fuck respect
The only sophomore that was stuck in chem
I failed him quicker than head from little quim
And I remember Brenda, a kiss in that September
Wanted to rape her and bend her
But I guess that shit offends her
Changed school mid-year, then I went to media arts
I didn’t know my heart wasn’t in the art to tell then
Ben 10 couldn’t picture
I felt like I got Jack for my fucking Ripper, skipper
Junior made the best shit ever
Grades good, I was clever, information I endeavor
I was the only nigga that took the essay, T
Well, it was two Asians, an ese
Three other blacks with a mixed, don’t count
Guessed on that math shit, I couldn’t move, roll ‘bout
Don’t smoke, I was sober, but my niggas had an ounce
Hotbox, had to move a school to escape, no doubt

Aye, okay, next part

[Verse 4]
Twelfth grade, going mental on the pencil
Instrumental black and motherfucking forth to Sacramento
Elve grade for two weeks, didn’t speak really
But I met the coolest people, if you hear me, y’all was illy
Amtrak, back and forth from the Sac’, I learned my lessons
Start cutting at my wrist, then I went to a depression
Suspended every week, hats taken, broke as fuck
Sarah dating other niggas, I was heated
I was treated like a stranger, all the gang bangers
Flang her, emo life was a hanger
My knowledge with college, well, a eighth grade polish
I was Nazi, I was nigga, I was angered, I was pilin’
But I fucked that for freshmen, fuck, I found it in time
When it now was in the chaw with a guy
Won a llama, soma nama with the niggas in the wooler
Fawligen and towel with a mother bodily holder
