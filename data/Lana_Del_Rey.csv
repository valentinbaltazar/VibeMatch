Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

[Chorus]
Country roads, take mе home
To the place I bеlong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

[Bridge]
I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
Radio reminds me of a home far away
Driving down the road, I get a feeling that I
Should have been home yesterday, yesterday

It's because she's in a world, preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors, running down the corridor

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, man

[Verse 3]
Harry Nilsson has a song, his voice breaks at 2:05
Something about the way he says ""Don't forget me"" makes me feel like
I just wish I had a friend like him, someone to give me five
Lennon in my back, whisperin' in my ear
""Come on, baby, you can thrive""
But I can't

[Pre-Chorus]
When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?

Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard

Stars in my eyes, hiking up Griffith
Thinking about who was sad and what didn't
Get said in the Midwest, wish I could tell you now
I wrote you a note, but I didn't send it
'Cause that's the best method the women here taught me about
What you don't really understand
I've got magic in my hand, stars in my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm a different kind of woman
If you want some basic bitch, go to the Beverly Center and find her
I'm sweet, bare feet
If you wanna go where nobody goes
That's where you'll find me
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, comе to my house on Genesee

[Bridge]
What you doin' with your lifе? Do you think about it?
Do you contemplate where we came from?
Lately, we've been makin' out a lot
Not talkin' 'bout the stuff that's at the very heart of things
Do you want children? Do you wanna marry me?
Do you wanna run marathons in Long Beach by the sea?
I've got things to do, like nothing at all
I wanna do them with you
Do you wanna do them with me?

[Verse 1]
I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?

[Pre-Chorus]
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, ""Come into my bedroom""
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymorе
This is the experiеnce of bein' an American whore

[Verse 2]
Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl

Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think

I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this (Mm), so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three?
Got a cop who turned on the backbeat
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now

Don't you understand what that means?
It means quit lusting after your neighbor
That's a heck of a life
You get to love your children in front of you
You get to love
You ever talk to somebody
""I want a new life""
""I don't love my wife anymore""
""I don't love my kids anymore""
""I'm missing out on life""
They're usually my age
Does that sound like love?
It's a life dominated with lust
And for too long, they've been holding it off
And finally, they just get weak and they say
""It doesn't matter anymore""
And the Spirit of God says
""I'll infuse you with dеsires for what you have
And what's in front of you"" (Yeah, yеah, yeah)
(Desires for what you have)
So, as He works deep in your heart
As you call out to Him and say
""I'm here, do it in me, Man""
""Help me want what I got""
""Help me love what's in front of me""
""Help me want more of my wife and more of my friends""
""And help me serve the city I live in and not wish it away and hope I can move""
""Help me, God""
""I wanna be a man of love, not a man of lust""
But you've gotta do that
So I bring you to this verse and I'm done, I'm done
Psalms, chapter eight
And you know where I got this verse?
This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth
It's gonna make me sound so spiritual, so I'm looking forward to it
I woke up this morning and God said, ""Check the Bible app""
I don't know if it was God, but it felt like God
And I had the thought in my head, “Check the Bible app”
I'm gonna speak to you from the verse of the day
That means I don't have to do anything
I don't have to look anywhere, I just get the verse of the day
So I get to the verse of the day
And here's the verse of the day, today, in the Bible app
Look at this (That's cool)
""Look at the splendor of the skies
Your creative genius glowing in the heavens
When I gaze, when I gaze at Your moon and Your stars
Mounted like jewels in their settings
I know You are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all""
When I look up and I see such wonder and workmanship above
""I have to ask this question""
""I've gotta ask this question""
Compared to all this cosmic glory
""Why would you ever bother with puny, mortal man?"" or be
Ooh, don't get me started on it
I could preach for another hour on infatuated
Or be infatuated with Adam's son
""Why are you so infatuated with me?""
You're the star creator, You're the ocean maker (Yeah, yeah)
You're the whale creator, you're the rhino designer
Who, who are you? (Rhino designer)
And then it goes on in verse five
And it says
""Yet, what honor You have given to me
Created only a little lower than Elohim""
Which is the name of Creator God, Artist God
You wanna call God ""Artist""?
At some point tonight, before you go to bed, go, ""Yo, Elohim""
And He'll hear, ""You're the best Artist ever""
""The little Elohim, crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence
You have delighted, You have delegated to them
Mastery over all You have made""
You have made me a partner with You
I used to think my preaching was mostly about You
And you're not gonna like this, but I'm gonna tell you the truth
I've discovered my preaching is mostly about meSee Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like3Embed"

There's a certain point the body can't come back from
In one year, we've learned the turn of the mouth
The depth that the chest cavity takes
Chucky was there for three out of three
I was there for the third 'cause I couldn't be
There for the one who was closest to me
But I can't say I run when things get hard
It's just that I don't trust myself with my heart
But I've had to let it break a little more
'Cause they say that's what it's for

That's how the light shines in

So everyone was there, they were standin', laughin'
And I'm on the side with my tears streamin' down
There's somethin' about the clutch of the wrist
He thought mine was his to cough into his mouth
We've only got hours
And I just can't stop cryin' 'cause all of the ways
When you see someone dyin'
The sea of your days flash in front of you
And you think about who would be with you

Think by the third of March, I was cracked open
Finally, the ground was cold, they wouldn't open
Brought by the sunlight of the spirit to pour into me
There's a name for it in Japanese, it's ""Kintsugi""
They sang folk songs from the '40s

How do my blood relatives know all of these songs?
I don't know anyone left who knows songs that I sing

I'm at the Roadrunner Café
Probably runnin' away from the feelings today
In the snow-capped mountains of the desert

That there's nothing to do except know that this is

When I look back, tracing fingertips over plastic bags
Thinking, ""I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two""

[Verse 2]
Will I die? Or will I get to that ten-year mark?
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?

[Verse 3]
Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?
Will I have one of mine?
Can I handle it even if I do?
It's said that my mind
Is not fit, or so they said, to carry a child
I guess I'll be fine

[Verse 4]
It wasn't my idea, the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy, I
See nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa, and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you, if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my arms
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket
Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side
'Cause, baby, I
Ran through a time when I felt you were doing it

I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco
I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
I had to sing for the prince in two hours
Sat in the shower
Gave myself two seconds to cry
It's a shame that we die

[Verse 6]
When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time
[Verse 7]
Caroline, what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by
The lake, twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen in the town I was born in, and die

[Verse 8]
Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away, never to come back?
Exotic places and people don't take the place of being your child
I give myself two seconds to cry
[Verse 9]
Let it crash over me
Like the waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite, as they bow down to me

[Verse 10]
Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me16Embed"

I know they think that it took somebody else
To make me beautiful, beautiful

But they're wrong

To put me together again like an experiment
Some big men behind the scenes
Sewing Frankenstein black dreams into my songs
But they're wrong

Or an owl to know you're listening, sitting while I'm drinking

'Cause I'm good in spirit, warm-bodied
A fallible deity wrapped up in white
I'm folk, I'm jazz, I'm blue, I'm green
Regrettably, also a white woman
But I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
If you don't believe me, my poetry, or my melodies
Feel it in your bones

This is a simple song, gonna write it for a friend
My shirt is inside out, I'm messy with the pen

And he was like, ""I might be in trouble""
He had flashes of the good life, he was like
""Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double?""

[Verse 1]
Met my boyfriend down at the taco truck
Pass me my vape, I'm feelin' sick, I need to take a puff
Imagine if we actually gave a fuck
Wouldn't that be somethin' to talk about for us?
Caribbean Blue in sweater weather, I'm falling into you
Although it seems I've gotten better, I can be violent too

[Chorus]
Oh, that's why they call me Lanita
When I get down, I'm bonita
Don't come find me in Reseda
I'll go crazy
Read my gold chain, says ""Lanita""
When I'm violent, it's Carlito's Way
Blood on my feet, on the street
I'm dancin' crazy

[Post-Chorus]
Spin it 'til you whip it into white cream, baby
Print it into black and white pages, don't faze me
Before you talk, let me stop what you're saying
I know, I know, I know that you hate me

Honey, I got up so early
And then, I got into the shower
I was just able to go back to sleep for a hour and a half
So that rocked, um, anyway (Ah, ah)
I had this dream where, um, aha, I don't know

[Part II: VB]

You heard my baby's back in town now (Oh no)
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over
Back, back to the garden
We're gettin' high now because we're older
Me, myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover

[Chorus]
Oh God, I miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice Bitch
On the stoop with your neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang, bang, kiss, kiss

I guess you could call it textbook
I was lookin' for the father I wanted back
And I thought I found it in Brentwood
It seemed only appropriate you'd easily have my back

[Pre-Chorus]
And then there was the issue of her
I didn't even like myself, or love the life I had
And there you were with shining stars
Standin' blue with open arms
You touched the detriment most of the friends I knew already had

[Chorus]
You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
And there we were, screamin' ""Black Lives Matter"" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah

Could we do this dance again?
Do you think if I go blonde, we could get our old love back?
I guess this is really the end
I never felt jealous before this year, but I'm jealous now

[Pre-Chorus]
People say we're too much alike
But maybe, finally, that'll make it right
At the end of all these sleepless nights
Other men I met felt right
Would smile at you and stick a knife
In your back
Finally, I met you so I'm not wonderin' why

[Chorus]
You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you

There's a picture on the wall
Of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer
Said, ""How the hell did you get there?""
Oh, Oklahoma
Mm-mm, mm

[Verse 2]
There were flowers that were dry
Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, ""A place I don't remember""
Oh, Oklahoma (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Jenny jumped into the pool
She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, ""Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's our bane""
She said ""You can't be a muse and be happy too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy""
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who

Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue
Blue banisters, ooh
Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue
My banisters blue

[Verse 3]
There's a hole that's in my heart
All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real
It's heat lightning, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 4]
'Cause there's a man that's in my past
There's a man that's still right here
He's real enough to touch
And in my darkest nights, he's shinin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Jenny was smokin' by the pool
We were writin' with Nikki Lane
I said I'm scared of the Santa Clarita Fires
I wish that it would rain
I said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause
[Chorus]
Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters gray
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin' bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and gray, ah-ah

Spring, I skip, God knows
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I sleep, Heaven knows
Every time it turns to May

My body is a map of LA
I stand straight like an angel with a halo
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', ""Hey, you, baby, let's go""
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

[Chorus]
In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
America, America
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

[Verse 2]
My body is a map of LA
And my heart is like paper, I hate you
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here
I'm not native, but
My curves, San Gabriel all day
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over

They built me up three-hundred feet tall just to tear me down
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter and this town

Plus the hate that they gave

And if this is the end, I want a boyfriend

Or walk home from the mall with
'Cause what I really meant is when I'm being honest
I'm tired of this shit

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my body is my temple, my heart is one too
The only thing that still fits me is this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
My time is run over, so the only time you'll ever see me
Is in your dreams, in my black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better

Swisher Sweet, magazines, promise you it's not
'Cause of you that I'm mean, it's my afterthoughts
And what I never said, why there's a price on my head
It's nothing to do with them, it's my karmic lineage
So I'm not friends with my mother, but I still love my dad

There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy
Larchmont Village smells like lilies of the valley
And the bookstore doors are opening
And it's finally happening

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with me
And, boy, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with the city
Like thе Paramount sign sparkling
Sparkling just for me

[Chorus]
You made me tradе my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryna make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses

[Verse 2]
There's something in the air
I hope it doesn't change, that it's for real
The beginning of something big happening
And by the mayor, the rallies
In the streets have ceased
And still, the shadows haunt the avenue
The silence is deafening

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with the streets
And, God, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I breakdance to the backbeat
And, God, does it sound sweet
Like it's playing just for me

[Chorus]
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryin' to make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

Trade her violets for roses

Like a bed of wildflowers
And I'll always make the sheets
Smell like gardenias wild at your feet
And I nourish you hazily

Baby, I, I, I, I've been runnin' on stardust
Alone for so long
I wouldn't know what hot fire was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee
I'm better with you
It's strange, but it's true, darling

[Chorus]
Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that burns
Baby, I’ll be like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I’ll do my best never to turn into something
That burns, burns, burns

So I ended up awkward but sweet
Later then hospitals, stand still on my feet
Comfortably numb, but with lithium came poetry

And baby, I, I’ve been running on star drip
IV's for so long
I wouldn't know how cruel the world was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee, I'm better
So I turn, but I learn (It from you, babe)

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that hurts
Baby, I run like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I promise that nothing will burn you
Nothing will burn, burn, burn

Listеning to White Stripes when thеy were white-hot
Listening to rock all day long

[Chorus]
When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress handling the heat
I wasn't famous, just listening to Kings of Leon to the beat
Like look at how I got this, look how I got this
Just singing the street
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I felt free 'cause I was only nineteen
Such a scene

Summer, summer's almost gone
We were talking about life, we were sitting outside 'til dawn
But I would still go back
If I could do it all again, I thought
Because it made me feel, made me feel like a god
'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god
Somehow it made me feel, made me feel like a god

[Chorus]
When I was a waitress wearing a white dress
Look how I do this, look how I got this
When I was a waitress working the night shift
You were my man, felt like I got this
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do it, look how I got this
I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do this, look how I got this

It made me feel, made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off

Under the chemtrails over the country club
Wearin' our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club

Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools
Baby, what's your sign?
My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun
You won't play, you're no fun
Well, I don't care what they think
Drag racing my little red sports car
I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild

You're in the wind, I'm in the water
Nobody's son, nobody's daughter
Watching the chemtrails over the country club

Washing my hair, doing the laundry
Late night TV, I want you on me
Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up

And if I had to do it all again
I would because, babe, in the end
It brought me here to you

I left Calabasas, escaped all the ashes, ran into the dark
And it made me wild, wild, wild at heart

""It's dark, but just a game""
That's what he would say to me
The faces aren't the same, but their stories all end tragically
(Sweet or whatever, baby)
And that's the price of fame
A tale as old as time you'd be (Sweet or whatever, baby)
A pretty little fool to think exceptions to the rule
Just walk around like you and me, this way
But life is sweet or whatever, baby
You gotta take them for what they got
And while the whole world is crazy
We're getting high in the parking lot

Wе keep changing all the time
The bеst ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game

It's dark, but just a game
So play it like a symphony
You know our love's the same, they'll both go down in infamy
I was a pretty little thing and God, I loved to sing
But nothing came from either one but pain (But fuck it)

I love you only, but it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing

[Verse 1: Nikki Lane]
Are these my good years or do I have none?
Are there really good years for everyone?
I don't wanna live with a life of regret
I don't wanna end up like Tammy Wynette

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Nikki Lane]
'Cause breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to bе lonely, but it's the right thing to do

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Georgе got arrested out on the lawn
We might be breakin' up after this song
Will he still love me long after I'm gone?
Or did he see it comin' all along?

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Nikki Lane]
'Cause breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely (Baby, breakin' up is hard to do)
Breakin' up slowly (Baby, breakin' up is hard to do)
Breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's makin' me blue

I'm coverin' Joni and I'm dancin' with Joan
Stevie is callin' on the telephone
Court almost burned down my home
But God, it feels good not to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes, this ranch feels like my only friend
And life doesn't always work out like we planned
We keep it movin', babe

[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

[Verse 2]
Troubled by my circumstancе
Burdened by the wеight of fame
Clementine's not just a fruit
It's my daughter's chosen name

[Pre-Chorus]
And when all the bars close down tonight
There's one that stays open just for us, alright

I went down to Woodside
I left Berkeley, out of city, out of mind
Killin' it, talkin' shit, Joan said she was gonna quit
Tearin' it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step
I left San Francisco
I've been coverin' Joni and I'm dancin' with Joan
It's kinda hard to find love
When you're used to rollin' like a rollin' stone

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shoppin' today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from their school
I was standin' on a noisy corner
Waitin' for the walkin' green
Across the street, he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Now me, I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen
Who escort me through these halls
And I'll play if you've got the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one-man band by thе quick lunch stand
He's been playin' real good for free

[Verse 3: Weyes Blood]
Nobody stopped to hеar him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on the TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signal changed

LyricsI left my city for San Francisco
Took a free ride off a billionaire's jet
LA, I'm from nowhere, who am I to love you?
LA, I've got nothing, who am I to love you when I'm feeling this way and I've got nothing to offer?
LA, not quite the city that never sleeps
Not quite the city that wakes, but the city that dreams, for sure
If by dreams, you mean in nightmares

LA, I'm a dreamer, but I'm from nowhere, who am I to dream?
LA, I'm upset, I have complaints, listen to me
They say I came from money and I didn't
And I didn't even have love, and it's unfair
LA, I sold my life rights for a big check and I'm upset
And now I can't sleep at night and I don't know why
Plus, I love Zach, so why did I do that when I know it won't last?

LA, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there
LA, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now?
Daughter to no one, table for one
Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my ex-husband works
I'm sick of this, but can I come home now?
Mother to no one, private jet for one
Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots
Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly, I'm resentful
The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted
The reason for Garcetti's extra security
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $49LA, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go, can I come home now?
I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son?
I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains?
I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters
Teach them about fire, warn them about water
I'm lonely, LA, can I come home now?

I left my city for San Francisco
And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge
But it's not going as I planned
I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter
And promised myself that I would stay, but
It's just not going the way that I thought
It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot
It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me
The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep
The city that's still deciding how good it can be

And also
I can't sleep without you
No one's ever really held me like you
Not quite tightly, but certainly, I feel your body next to me
Smoking next to me
Vaping lightly next to me
And I love that you love the neon lights like me
Orange in the distance
We both love that
And I love that we have that in common
Also, neither one of us can go back to New York
For you are unmoving
As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead
Fuck the New York Post
LA, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much?
And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet
I may never know that either until I'm dead
For now, though, what I do know
Is although I don't deserve you
Not you at your best and your splendor
With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion
Not you at your worst
Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you
You see, I have no mother
And you do
A continental shelf
A larger piece of land from where you came
And I?
I'm an orphan
A little seashell that rests upon your native shores
One of many, for sure
But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone

For that reason, let me love you
Don't mind my desperation
Let me hold you, not just for vacation
But for real and for forever
Make it real life
Let me be a real wife to you
Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend
I adore you
Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure
I promise you'll barely even notice me
Unless you want to notice me
Unless you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can turn it on too
I'm quite good on the stage as you may know
You might have heard of me
So either way, I'll fit in just fine
So just love me by doing nothing
And perhaps, by not shaking the county line
I'm yours if you'll have me
But regardless, you're mine8Embed"

The ying to my yang
the toughness to my unending softness

sure in your confrontation against all elements
and duality

The earth to the wildflower that doesn't care where it grows

there's no escaping it
the air is fried and on fire

like someone I've stood next to before
but never while I was standing next to you

Through the year I've called you in and out of my orbit
You, in your madness
the satellite that constellates my world
mimicking the inner chaos that I've disowned
a mirror to my past life retributions
and a reflection of my sadness
If I'm going to keep on living the way that I'm living
I can't do it without you
My feet aren't on the ground
I need your body to stand on
your name to define me
on top of being a woman
I am scared
and
ethereal

There are seven worlds in my eyes

[Stanza 5]
I'm accessing of all them once

[Stanza 6]
One to draw my words from and my muses
Another one I try and harness late at night that lies somewhere
off of the right of Jupiter
And then of course there's this one I live in
The land of a thousand fires
That's where you come in

You
Vernon
Dylan
Two blue steel trains running through the tunnels of your cool blue steel eyes

[Stanza 8]
To guide me far from the world of my early days
That I can't quite make out clearly
That beckon me towards high sea cliffs
On long car rides

[Stanza 9]
Towards a future place
A world unknown to me
Made up of something surreal and dripping
Flowers in solar systems oversized

You Vernon Dylan

[Stanza 11]
No words needed to sponge up the dark nights
No explanations for the globes in my eyes
Shoulder to shoulder in the factory light
Letting me be who I would have been if everything had turned out alright
[Stanza 12]
Three alternative endings
Now course through my blood on ice
But I thrive because I say I do
And because it's what I write

[Stanza 13]
But honestly, if you weren't here with me
I don't know what things would look like

[Stanza 14]
That's my why no matter what world I'm in

I can’t seem to blow off enough steam to get you out of my head
Soul cycle you to death, run you out of my blood to San Pedro
And yet, everywhere I go, it seems there you are,
And there I am

I don’t want to sell my stories anymore, stop pushing me
Some stories aren’t meant to be sold
Some words aren’t meant to be told

I want to leave them underneath the nightstand to be forgotten
or remembered should my thoughts come upon them in the middle of the night after a long beach day
Or by you, some afternoon, to thumb through with your worn warm after-work hands
I love you, but you don’t understand me, I’m a real poet!
My life is my poetry, my love making is my legacy!
My thoughts are about nothing, and beautiful, and for free

You see, the things that can’t be bought can’t be evaluated, and that makes them beyond human reach
Untouchable, safe, otherworldy
Unable to be deciphered or metabolized

Something metaphysical,

may they never gaze as high as heaven, to ask why
May I never go where angels fear to tread
so as to have to ask for answers in the sky
The whys in this lifetime i've found are inconsequential
compared to the magic of the nowness - the solution to most
questions
there are no reasons

And if there are - i'm wrong
but at least i won't have spent my life waiting
looking for God in the clouds of the dawn

I'll be up early to rise though of course -
but only to make you a pot of coffee

That's what i was thinking this morning Joe
that it's times like this as the marine layer lifts
off the sea from the view of our favorite restaurant
that i pray that i may
always keep my eyes level to your eyeline
never downcast at the table cloth
You see, Joe
it's times like this that the marine layer lifts
off the sea on the dock with out candle lit
that i think to myself
there are things you still don't know about me
like sometimes i'm afraid my sadness is too big
and that one day you might have to help me handle it
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $49But until then
may my eyes always stay level to the skyline
assessing Long Beach's glittering new development
never higher than the tallest building
never to heaven or revenant
'Cause i have faith in man as strange as that seems
in times like these
and it's not just because of the warmth i've found in your
brown eyes
It's because i believe in the goodness in me
that it's firm enough to plant a flag in
or a
rosebud
or to build a new life.2Embed"

Or parking on the block where our old place used to be

Genesee, genesee, genesee

Pathetic, I know - but sometimes I still like to park on that street,
And have lunch in the car just to feel close to you

I was once in love with my life here,
In that studio apartment with you
Little yellow flowers on the tops of trees as our only view,
Out of the only window,
Big enough for me to see our future through
But it turned out I was the only one who could see it
Stupid apartment complex
Terrible you
You, who I wait for
You, you, you
Like a broken record stuck on loop

So that day, on my birthday, I thought
""Something has to change""
You can’t always be about waiting for you

Don’t tell anyone, but part of my reasoning for taking the flight class, was this idea that if I could become my own navigator
The captain of the sky,
That perhaps I could stop looking for direction
from you
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $49Well, what started off as an idea on a whim,
Has turned into something more
Too shy to explain to the owners that my first lesson was just a one-time thing
I’ve continued to go to classes each week
At the precious little strip off Santa Monica and Bundy

And everything was going fine
We were starting with dips and loops
and then something terrible happened

During my fourth lesson in the sky
My instructor, younger than I, but as tough as you
Instructed me to do a simple maneuverer
It’s not that I didn’t do it,
But I was slow to lean the sports cruiser into a right hand upward turn
Scared, scared that I would lose control of the plane

Not tactfully and not gently
The instructor shook his head, and without looking at me said
“You don’t trust yourself”

I was horrified
Feeling as though I’d somehow been found out
Like he knew me
How weak I was
Of course, he was only talking about my ability as a pilot in the sky
But I knew it was meant for me to hear those words
For me, they held a deeper meaning
I didn’t trust myself

Not just 25,000 feet above the coast of Malibu
But with anything
And I didn’t trust you

I could’ve said something but I was quiet
Because pilots aren’t like poets
They don’t make metaphors between life and the sky

In the midst of this mid-life, meltdown, navigational exercise in self-examination,
I also decided to do something else I always wanted to do
Take sailing lessons in the vibrant bay of Marina del Rey
I signed up for the class as ""Elizabeth Grant"",
And nobody blinked an eye

So, why was I so sure that when I walked into the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone would say
“You’re not a captain of a ship, or a master of the sky!”
No, the fisherman didn’t care, and so neither did I

And for a brief moment, I felt more myself than ever before

Letting the self proclaimed drunkard captain’s lessons wash over me like the foamy tops of the sea

Midway through my forehead burned,
and my hands raw from driving
The captain told me the most important thing I’d need to know on the sea
“Never run the ship into irons”
That’s nautical terms for not sailing the boat directly into the wind

In order to do that though, you have to know where the wind is coming from

And you might not have time to look up to the mast,
Or up further to the weathervane
So you have to feel where the wind is coming from
On your cheeks, and by the tips of the white waves from which direction they’re rolling

To do this, he gave me an exercise
He told me to close my eyes, and asked me to feel on my neck which way the wind was blowing
I already knew I was going to get it wrong
“The wind is coming from everywhere, I feel it all over” I told him
“No”, he said “the wind is coming from the left. The portside”
I sat waiting for him to tell me “You don’t trust yourself”

But he didn’t, so I said it for him
“I don’t trust myself”

He laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper level

“It’s not that you don’t trust yourself” he said. “it’s simply that you’re not a captain. It isn’t what you do”

Then he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better

“Which grocery store do you go to?” he asked
“To the Ralphs in the Palisades” I replied

“Okay. When you’re in the Ralphs in the Palisades,
I want you, as you're walking from your car to the store,
To close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing
Now, I don’t want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot,
but everywhere you go,
I want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from
And then, determine if it’s from the port or starboard side,
So when you’re back on the boat you have a better sense of it”

I thought his advice was adorable
I could already picture myself in the parking lot,
Squinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on

I could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing
And as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself
I thought of mentioning it,
but I didn’t
Because captain’s aren’t like poets
They don’t make metaphors between sea and sky

And as I thought that to myself,
I realized
that’s why I write
All of this circumnavigating the earth,
Was to get back to my life
Six trips to the moon for my poetry to arise
I’m not a captain,
I’m not a pilot
I write!
I write5Embed"

Except for a healer on 6th street in Ridgely
Tessa DiPietro,
recommended casually by a medium I no longer know

She said my number one problem was that my field was untrusting
When asked what to do, she paused and said “Nothing”
Which sent me right into uncontrollable sobbing

Because there’s never anything you can do about the important things

She said “Okay, one thing you can do is picture the floor rising up to support you,
And sink into the back of the bed that’s behind you
Too much of your energy is in front and above you”

Which, for some reason, made me think of a live show I’d seen
Jim Morrison at the Hollywood Bowl, 1968, check date

The blue trellis lights gave him an unusual aura
Like a halo or something
Made him 8 feet or taller

I remember just thinking he looked out of his body
but definitely like a god on stage

So I told her “Maybe an artist has to function a little bit above themselves,
If they really want to transmit some heaven”
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $49And she told me
""A singleness of focus is the key to transmission,
For an emphasis on developing inner intuition,
Close your eyes and feel where you hold your attention

If it’s in the back of your eyes
Walk it down to your heart’s centre
and make that the new place from which your thoughts enter

Clairvoyance comes mostly from this simple function
Oh - and Jim died at 27
So find another frame of reference
When you’re referencing heaven

And have you ever read the lyrics to ‘People are Strange’?
He made no sense!""2Embed"

And I think about the last time you visited me

And it felt like the ocean was the sky
And that I was flying because you were two feet taller than me
Until you took me in your arms
And I could touch the stars
And they all fell down around my head
And I became an angel
And you put me to bed

And on the back it says: happy,  joyous, and free

I acknowledged who you really were for the first time

I didn’t call you by any other name
I let you know that I knew the true nature of your heart
That it was evil, and that it convinced me that darkness was real
that the devil is a real devil
and that monsters don’t always know that they’re monsters

But projection is an amazing thing
after you left and burnt the house down
you tried to convince me that it was I who was holding the matches
You told me that I didn’t know who I was, but I do
I love rose gardens
I plant violets every time someone leaves me
I love the great sequoias of Yosemite
And if you asked my sister to describe the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of me
she would say ""camp fire smoke""

I’m gentle
I’m funny when I’m drunk
But I haven’t been drunk for 14 years
I go on trips with my friends to the beach who don’t know that I’m crazy
I can do that
I can do anything

And the longer I stay here

We were fighting the fires in Agora
But I’m tired of fighting you

Paradise is very fragile,
and it's only getting worse

And every time I think of that,
I think about the curse bestowed upon Eve, that fateful eve,
She took that bite of fruit from that fruitful tree
And this summer night, you in front of me,
Makes me contemplate the origins of good and evil

Because you take and you take and you take and you take,
But you taste like the beach and a kiss
Candy from my eyes
In my veins you run citrus

Watercolor images of serpents on orange trees
Arise in my midst
Kundalini, you breathe me
I could do this forever
But my heart is very fragile,
and I have nothing left to give1Embed"

Stay on your path Sylvia Plath
don't fall away like all the others

[Stanza 2]
Don't take all your secrets alone to your watery grave about
lovers and -

[Stanza 3]
The secrets you keep will keep you in deep like Amy and -
And brother
And all of the people you meet on the street will reiterate lies
that they uttered

[Stanza 4]
Leave me in peace, I cry
In the middle of the night
On a slow boat bound for Catalina for no reason

[Stanza 5]
Tiny drops of perspiration dot my forehead
could be mistaken for dew drops if this were photo season

[Stanza 6]
But alas this is a real life - and it's been a real fight just to
stop my mind from committing treason
Why you ask?
Because she told the townspeople I was crazy, and the lies, they
started to believe them
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $49[Stanza 7]
But anyways - that's all over now

[Stanza 8]
I've moved on, gone scorched earth
And now I'm left wondering where to go from here
To Sonoma where the fires have just left?
South Dakota?

[Stanza 9]
Would standing in front of Mount Rushmore feel like the Great
American homecoming I never had?

[Stanza 10]
Would the magnitude of the scale of the sculptures take the place
of the warm embrace I've never got?

[Stanza 11]
Or should I just be here now
Bare feet on linoleum
Slicing vegetables onto water that I will later turn
into stew

[Stanza 12]
People love my stories
People love visions2Embed"

You fucked me so good that I almost said ""I love you""

But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah

You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two

At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind

Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?

I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
""Maybe  I'll do it differently""

[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you

Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

John met me down on the boulevard
Cry on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

[Chorus]
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

[Verse 2]
Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

[Chorus]
This is how to disappear

But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine

I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Verse 2]
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ""Hi, Dad""

Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

[Bridge]
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in lo-ove
To be young and in lo-ove

[Verse 2]
Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it

[Pre-Chorus]
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

[Verse 1]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera-ready
Almost all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still get lonely and, baby, only then
Do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'

I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
On my treadmill, but I'm comin' up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm cryin' while I'm cummin'
Makin' love while I'm makin' good money
Sobbin' in my cup of coffee 'cause I fell for another loser

[Pre-Chorus]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
With the things that you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings (Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again (I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin' (Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughin' as I'm taking no prisoners and taking down names
I'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'
In the smoke, they can hear me comin'
If you were me and I was you, I'd get out of my way

I was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it 'cause, baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin', they put out the warnin'
Tensions were risin' over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes
Wrapped up like garland roses
Around their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time

[Chorus]
I'd trade it all for a stairway to Heaven (A stairway, stairway to Heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (Stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

I was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breakin' 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got goin'
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

[Pre-Chorus]
What about all these children
And all their children's children?
And why am I even wonderin' that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds
And birds would send my thoughts your way

I'd trade it all for a stairway to Heaven (A stairway, stairway to Heaven)

Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumblin' from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can, sometimes, make it hard to dream

Life rocked me like Mötley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

[Chorus]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
How it gave you everythin' and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again and tell me everything's okay
Ayy, babe, yeah

Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone, 'cause they still feel him here
I wanna leave, I'll probably stay another year

There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in hotly and it's coming in strong

[Refrain]
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But

[Pre-Chorus]
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because

[Chorus]
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

Finally, I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly, that will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

[Pre-Chorus]
This is my commitment, my modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us who never got the chance
For and for (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I wanna get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do, I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)

[Verse 2]
Finally, gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of bein'
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was, I was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

Their arches are illusions, solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)

And put you in a trance (Ah, yeah)

Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

[Verse 2]
Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things that have yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights

That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time

Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened

I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, our love

Down on the West Coast, they got a saying:
If you're not drinking, then you're not playing
But you got the music, you got the music in you
Don't you?
Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy blue, yeah you

You're falling hard, I push away
I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quite
I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my lovе

Down on the West Coast, they got thеir icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you got the music, you got the music in you
Don't you?
Down on the West Coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and Rock and Roll groupies
And you got the music, you got the music in you

Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
And there are never toys that's scattered everywhere

He finds her waitin' like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side

And as the years go by, the other woman will spend her life alone

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean, they're special, just for you
White lines, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that, you already know
(Fuck!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime

The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
And there are never toys that's scattered everywhere

He finds her waitin' like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side

Put your hands on my waist, do it softly

Trying to tell me to wait, but I can't wait to see you
So I run like I'm mad to heaven's door
I don't wanna be bad, I won't cheat you no more

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

[Verse 2]
Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine?

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night

And the spirit of John moved upon the face of the waters;
And John said ""Let there be light"" and there was light;
And John saw that it was good

[Interlude 1: Lana Del Rey]
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us for our sins
Creator of all forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins
Thank you God

[Interlude 2: John Wayne, Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe & Jesus]
I wanna tell you where you're at, you lose me in this campsite, and I'm gonna teach you how to be cowboys;
Now, if you wanna be tough cowboys I don't wanna hear ya' crying, I don't wanna hear ya' bellyaching, you gotta get on that horse and ride; (And I guess I'll never find you)
And don't be afraid, wear your boats up high, your pant low; (Sex is a part of nature, I go along with the nature)
with your head in a good way, (You're always on my mind, you're always on my mind)
And when you get on there don't be jerkin' on it, just ride nice and soft
You can do it; (Earth is missing, distant from us)
I believe in ya', ride with the wind, (Oh I must have you, or no one) (Forgive us, distant...)
don't complain and never say you're sorry, sorry is a sign of weakness, (Forgive us intense, please forgive those distant...)
I don't want you go back to your mama because I'll run you back out (And lead us not into temptation) (I want you to kiss me) (I love you)
You're a good kid, all you lil' cowboy will do a good job for me
make sure you do it children, 'cause I'll be watching you
(Life can change on a dime, sometimes you just have to gain) (Yeah baby, that's what it is, that is what is all about) (Amen)
Don't forget, I'll write to your mama (I don't lie)

(Noooo)

[Interlude 3: Lana Del Rey & Elvis Presley]
I sing the Body electric;
The armies of those I love engirt me, and I engirt them;
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, (Man you've got to be crazy!)
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul

[Interlude 4: Lana Del Rey]
Womanhood, and all that is woman - and the man that comes from woman
The womb, the tits, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and rising
The voice, articulation
Language
Whispering, shouting aloud
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep
Walking, swimming, poise on the hips
Leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth
And around the eyes
The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair
The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body
The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees
The thin red jellies within you or within me - the bones and the marrow in the bones
The exquisite realization of health;
Oh I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul
Oh I say now, these are the Soul!
[Gods and Monsters]

(Oh I must have you, or no one)

[Spoken 1: Lana Del Rey & Shaun Ross]
- ""You know it's not always gonna be this way, right?""
- ""Yeah..""
- ""So just chill, alright?""
- ""Mhmm""
- ""Alright..""
- ""Yeah.""

(Just remember, I'm always there for ya')

[Dialog: Birthday Party w/ Strippers]
In honor of Jack's birthday tonight, I thought bring somebody here tonight that Jack can jack off to. (Laughs)
No, with seriousness, are you ready? Ladies...

(All the money, feel my temperature rising)

[Interlude 5: Lana Del Rey]
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked
Dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix
Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz
Who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated
Who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war
Who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull
Who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall
Who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York
Who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
With dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares
[Robbery]

And so, from being created in his likeness, to being banished for wanting to be too much like him, we were cast out, and the garden of Eden transformed in to the garden of Evil
Los Angeles, The city of Angels, A land of Gods and Monsters, The in-between realm where only the choices made from your free will, will decide your souls final fate
Some poets called it the entrance to the Underworld, but on some summer nights, it could feel like Paradise, Paradise Lost

[Interlude 1 - Variation: Lana Del Rey]
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Master of the Universe, creator of all forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John

[Spoken 2: John Wayne]
You ask me why I love her? Well give me time, I'll explain
Have you ever seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?
Have you ever drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?
Or watched a cold fog come drifting in over San Francisco Bay?
Have you heard a bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines
Or heard the bellow of a diesel at the Appalachia mines?
Does the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?
Or do you look with awe and wonder, Massachusetts shore
Brave new men who stepped on Plymounth's rock?
And do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock?
Have you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies, way up high?
Or seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?
Do you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea
Or bow your head at Gettysburg at our struggle to be free?
You ask me why I love her? I've got a million reasons why:
It's my beautiful America, beneath God's wide, wide sky
[Bel Air]

Lovin' you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on

It won't leave my head
Your soul is hauntin' me
And tellin' me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (Dead like you)

Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light

She wore blue velvet

Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
""Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want""
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins

[Chorus]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight
And I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raisin' hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it
[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hangin' from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""

[Chorus]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

[Outro]
You are my one true love351Embed"

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipatin' and pacing
But he was chasin' (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

You went out every night and, baby, that's alright
I told you that, no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time

Promise you'll remember that you're mine

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"" He said, ""Yes"" (Yes, yes)

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I am standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealin' with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(""Yes, of course I will, my darling"")

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes

Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having fun

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, ""You don't wanna be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'""
She says, ""You don't wanna get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin""

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning

[Verse 2]
Carmen, Carmen, stayin' up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarmin' you can be

Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneakin' out, lookin' for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, ""Hi, hi""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
""Lana, how I hate those guys""

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it

Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job with the boss

Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' Cherry Schnapps in the velvet night

Yo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmerin', we'd swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', ""Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot""

I got sent away, I was wavin' on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind

I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby

Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
""Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want""
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

In the blue range across my view

Bet you fine about lifetime sunshine boo

Tied down the club like living like gangsters
Both wanna die, love living in danger
Bodies all around, put it down like an

Money on his mind 'bout getting his paper

Walked into the room, you know, you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean, for sure
You're so freshed a doesn't sick as ca-cancer
You're sort a punk-rock, I grew on hip-hop

But you fit me better, than my favorite sweater
And I know, that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day, we meet on December, oh baby

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time, I would wait for a million
Years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby, ohhh)
I will love you till the end of time

Big dreams, gangster
Said: ""You have to leave to star, your life over""
I was like: ""No please, stay here""
We don't need no money, we can make it all work
But he headed on Sunday, said come home Monday
I stayed waitin', anticipating and pacing
But he was, chasing, paper
""Caught in the game"" that was the last I heard

I will love you till the end of time, I would wait a million
Years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see throught the tears
Love you more than those bitches before

Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby, ohhh)
I will love you till the end of time

He went it every night, and baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be your side
Cause I'm a ride or die, whatever fail or fly
Well, shit at least we tried
But when you walked to that door, a piece of me died
Don't you want any more, but he have any mind
Just want it like before, we were dancing all night
When they took you away, stole you all that my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'till the end of time, I would wait for a
Million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn

You're so fresh to death and sick as cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time

Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like - no please, stay here
We don't need no money, we can make it all work
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday

But he was chasing paper, caught up in the game

Why? (Got that?)
Who? Me? (Louder)
Why? (Got that?)

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]
Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (Louder)

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (Louder, alright)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost, but now I am found
I can see that, once, I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey (Louder)

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (Louder, alright)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Post-Chorus]
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
[Pre-Chorus]
So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (Louder, alright)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do
N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do
Hm-mm

[Verse 1]
Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Livin' for the fame
Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playin' video games

[Pre-Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do

Swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer and you say, ""Get over here
And play a video game""
I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, ""You the bestest,"" lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
""Go play your video game""

[Pre-Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you

Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do

Who? Me? (Louder)
Why? (Got that?)

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]
Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (Louder)

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (Louder, alright)

My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny, the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

[Refrain]
Swimmin' pool, glimmering darlin'
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool, bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins, gimme them coins

[Chorus]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

[Refrain]
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins

[Chorus]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight
And I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raisin' hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it
[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hangin' from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""

[Chorus]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipatin' and pacing
But he was chasin' (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

[Bridge]
You went out every night and, baby, that's alright
I told you that, no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"" He said, ""Yes"" (Yes, yes)

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact (Kiss, kiss)

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I am standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealin' with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(""Yes, of course I will, my darling"")

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

That's the little story of the girl you know
Relyin' on the kindness of strangers
Tyin' cherry knots, smilin', doin' party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie

Holdin' me tight in our final hour
I don't know how you convince them and get them, babe
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you

One for the money and two for the show
I love you, honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Verse 2]
You've got the world, but baby, at what price?
Something so strange, hard to define
It isn't that hard, boy, to like you or love you
I'd follow you down, down, down, you're unbelievable
If you're goin' crazy, just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down, down, down anywhere, anywhere

Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneakin' out, lookin' for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, ""Hi, hi""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
""Lana, how I hate those guys""

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him

Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job with the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' Cherry Schnapps in the velvet night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmerin', we'd swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', ""Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot""

We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was wavin' on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny, the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

[Refrain]
Swimmin' pool, glimmering darlin'
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool, bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins, gimme them coins

[Chorus]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

[Refrain]
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins

[Chorus]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight
And I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raisin' hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it
[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hangin' from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""

[Chorus]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

You are my one true love351Embed"

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipatin' and pacing
But he was chasin' (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)

You went out every night and, baby, that's alright
I told you that, no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"" He said, ""Yes"" (Yes, yes)

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes

I sing the national anthem
While I am standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealin' with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(""Yes, of course I will, my darling"")

Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having fun

Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneakin' out, lookin' for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, ""Hi, hi""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
""Lana, how I hate those guys""

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him

Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job with the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' Cherry Schnapps in the velvet night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmerin', we'd swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', ""Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot""

The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know somethin'?

[Verse 3]
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was wavin' on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday

I will love you 'til the end of time

Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?

[Bridge]
You went out every night and, baby, that's alright
I told you that, no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny, the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

[Refrain]
Swimmin' pool, glimmering darlin'
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool, bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins, gimme them coins

[Chorus]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

[Refrain]
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins

[Chorus]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight
And I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raisin' hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it
[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hangin' from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""

[Chorus]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

The way your hair come down, it make you look older
How you get so handsome, my boy?

Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me

Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though

Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?

Did you want to die, want to die, want to die?

Cause I'm going to Pensacola?
Where nobody knows me
Where someone could just start over
I'll be all right in a month or two
Cause it's warm there in the winter, too
Think New York is great, I really like the state
But it's time to be on my way

Then I got tired and ended up in some lame department store
And that's okay, cause I found a really cool belt and..

To close my eyes and visualize my troubles away and I
Think of you here and I close my eyes tight
