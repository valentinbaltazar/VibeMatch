I can do this with my eyes closed

[Verse 1]
I'm back from the dead, from the back of my head
Been gone and facin' horrors that should never be said
The wrath and the grit from the pit of despair
Been takin' every whip and word, I've never been spared

[Pre-Chorus]
They say tomorrow's never promised, honest
They say that angels are among us

[Chorus]
Lock me up in a maze (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
I was born, I was raised for this (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)
Lock me up inside a cage
Just throw away the key, don't worry 'bout me
I was drivin' in my car, throwin' up my hands, put it in coast

[Post-Chorus]
I can do this with my eyes closed
Turn out, turn out the lights
I can do this with my eyes closed

Less medications, less manifestations
Mantras, meditation, throw it all away
All the places I've been, all the blood that I've bled
I've been broken down and beat up but I still get ahead
All the faceless embraces and the tasteless two faces
Killed and resurrected 'cause I'll never be dead

[Pre-Chorus]
They say tomorrow's never promised, honest
Yeah, they say piranhas are among us

[Chorus]
Lock me up in a maze (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh)
I was born, I was raised for this (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)
Lock me up inside a cage

[Post-Chorus]
I can do this with my eyes closed
Turn out, turn out the lights
I can do this with my eyes closed
Turn out, turn out the lights
I can, I can do this with my eyes—
[Bridge]
And when the day broke, buried in violence
Somethin' made my mind up
I will spend these days as an island
Alone and far away

[Chorus]
Lock me up in a maze (Oh, maze)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)

And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
I walk through the halls where I used to be led
And my heart is filled with reasons

I'm finding it hard to love myself

But that is impossible to do

You know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I want to put you into the spotlight

Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little-

[Verse 1]
Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twicе
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seizе
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

[Chorus]
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?

We're just getting started, Vegas
We got some surprises for you 'night!

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
But I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
Go! (Oh, oh)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes (Oh, oh)
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
I do whatever it takes
Say it! (Oh, oh)
Take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes (Oh, oh)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
I'm always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Pull me like a ripcord

Take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes  (Oh, oh)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world, the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
A symbol to remind you that there's more to see
A product of the system, a catastrophe
Yet a masterpiece, yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Let's go!

Las Vegas
May we always be young
May we always be young at heart
May we stay innocent
Even in the city of sin

[Verse 1]
Seems there's something in the air today
It's got me feeling, oh, a certain way
Seems like lately, I've been on the run
It's got me reeling every night I'm done
Keep thinking, what am I supposed to do?
My body's not working like it used to
And these bills keep piling up on me
Remember when I had no responsibilities

[Chorus]
So take me back when I was younger
And I was still hungry, oh
Take me back when I was younger
Yeah, I got the world at my feet
Just try and stop me (Just try and stop me)
Yeah, take me back when I was younger

[Verse 2]
'Been watching all my friends pass away
When they promised me that they would be here today
I wish that I could put a force field
Around every single one of us
I would protect you from everything
(I'd put a force field) All around us
And ground us forever and ever

So take me back when I was younger
And I was still hungry, oh
Take me back when I was younger
Yeah, I got the world at my feet
Just try and stop me (Just try and stop me)
Yeah, take me back when I was younger

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be here forever
But I don't wanna grow older

Let me see your hands, Las Vegas
We love you!

So take me back when I was younger
When I was still hungry
When I still had it in me
Take me, come on Wayne!

Hide away your sons and daughters
Eat you alive

Look out for yourself, oh!

[Verse 1]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back was to the world that was smilin' when I turned

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called

They say pray it away
I swear, that I'll never be a saint, no way
A chair in the corner is a place I stay
I shake and I think about the powers at play, the powers at play
And the kids in the dark that were doomed from the start
The child in the basement, face to the pavement
Oh, what a statement, love is embracement
Love is a constant, love is a basis
He cannot be, she cannot be, they cannot be changed
But keep on praying
Goodbye

Are the worst of all, the blood's run stale

Do you know the line that I'd walk for you? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is raging against us now (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the rush way up here

There's nights we had to just walk away (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

It's hard, believe me, I've tried

But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say
That I wouldn't have it any other way!

If you wait for it, if you wait for it

[Verse 1]
Try to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

[Pre-Chorus]
I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

[Chorus]
Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

[Verse 2]
You kiss and you kiss, and you love and you love
You've got a history list, and the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor, and the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I took a walk on a Saturday night
Fog in the air just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
Shaking hands run through my hair
My fears, where do I go from here?

[Chorus]
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

[Verse 2]
Walking down to the water's edge
Asking why I'm here instead of home
Now I stand alone
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to fill inside with peace
Like you were here with me

[Chorus]
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

Oh, it's in the faintest cry

Is when I need you most
And don't you know?

When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

I'm bleedin' out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
I’m bleedin' out
I’m bleedin' out for you, for you

[Verse 1]
When the day has come
That I’ve lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns grey
And everything is screamin'
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beatin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong!

And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollerin'

When doubts begin to rise and the world is at your feet
You gotta get up

I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

I'm not a selfless man, I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world, probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk by myself

There's lights that line these halls
That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on

We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh, the jury stole my fame

And it shined into these eyes

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
Your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside

At the curtain's call, it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
They dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
I'm never changing who I am

You guys are crazy
Sing it with me

And I am left to sell

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's wherе my demons hide, it's wherе my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

[Refrain]
Now take it in but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 2]
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Demons, demons, my demons

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Demons, my demons, my demons
My demons, my demons, my demons

[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

And I am left to sail

I know when my day will come
Go back to the place that I came from
Lookin' back, will I think that I did it right?
I still don't sleep at night
I got these symphonies stuck in my head
And they don't leave
Fillin' up the silence with these notes
I don't want them to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Ghosts follow me around these days
Haunting my head and house
My mind is crazy loud
But I won't give in to it
Take it all in stride

[Chorus]
This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try

Filling up my treetops with these crows
I wish that they would go

All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you

[Verse 1]
You call me up just to say
You think we're better off this way
Leaves may fall, seasons change
Yet we remain
A year away, a year alone
The tears have fall, but we have grown
The sun will rise, the seasons change (Change)
And here we are

How much I've thought of you today
The leaves have fall, the seasons change
Yet we remain
A year has passed, our children grow
And in their eyes, I see your soul
The sun grows bright, the rain has gone
And here we are

[Chorus]
All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
And still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you (I'm tied)

Time will heal our hearts
But were we doomed from the start?
Or were we planned in the stars?
Or is there any God at all?

Seems there's something in the air today
It’s got me feeling, oh, a certain way
Seems like lately, I've been on the run
It's got me reeling every night I’m done
Keep thinking, what am I supposed to do?
My body's not working like it used to
And these bills keep piling up on me
Remember when I had no responsibilities

[Chorus]
So take me back when I was younger
And I was still hungry, oh
Take me back when I was younger
Yeah, I got the world at my feet
Just try and stop me (Just try and stop me)
Yeah, take me back when I was younger

When they promised me that they would be here today
I wish that I could put a force field
Around every single one of us
I would protect you from everything

He was never gonna make it
Every pill he found, he'd take it
Always on the edge of breakdowns
Keepin' it together somehow
Just another cold November
You called me, but I didn't answer
I was so oblivious, now, I'm askin' for forgiveness
For every single time I failed you
I'm feelin' like it's me that killed you
Rememberin' the time they jumped you
And I was too scared to help you
Looking back, I can't erase it
I guess it's time to face it
You never seemed to know how to let it all go

See, I wish I could take it back
Change the future and erase the past
Grab the bullet out and pull you back
I promise that I'd save your life like you saved mine
But now, it's far too late for that
And all I have is your story left to tell
So, let me tell it, let me tell

Look out for yourself

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy

Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Uh, look, okay
I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy

And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

[Refrain]
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

[Verse 2]
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

So I wrote a song to be my lullaby
Sing me to sleep at night, open my third eye

I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch?
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go

Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I'm runnin' from demons of my past
So I wrote a song to help me slow down
Keep my mind straight, but it's a bit late

Everyone in school while you're sittin' at home

And I swear I'll make things right before the long night
Swear I'll make things right tomorrow

And when my well of Wellbutrin is
Running dry of serotonin
I can say things I don't mean
Or maybe it's the truth in me
I feel it building, bubbling up
My t-t-time is up

I'm so (Mis-) misunderstood (-un)
But I live for this (-der), my money's good (-stood)
And I came to win (Mis-), so step on up (-un)

I've been making my Gethsemane
Since I was young, my ancestry (Cutthroat)
Was marching martyrdom across the
Radadada dumbla plains of Utah (Cutthroat)
I can't lie, I've been played
By powerful pеople who get their way
But I, in timе, will climb my mountain
I, in time, will rise

One day, I'll change my ways
Till then, I'm stuck in this space
Shut down and hiding my face
Tuned out and losing my faith

Stand up, tired of being the victim
You only on the outs, if you with them
Only hurts if you give 'em credence (Ah)
Give 'em reasons (Ah)
They're not better than you
They're just a figment of imagination

There are times when I don't like myself
I believe all the things that they say about me ('Bout me)
I wanna love myself, just likе everyone еlse
But there are times when I don't like myself

But karma is coming around
Tongue-tied, and you got the best of me

I had a dream that I lost everything (Everything)
All that I'd worked for was gone
Goodness me (Goodness me)
But I felt the same as I do right now
Everything is meaningless
At least that's how it feels (Feels real bad)

Try as I might
I can't get no peace of mind
I try every time
But can't get no peace of mind (Mind)

[Verse 2]
I've got so much to be happy about (Happy about)
I'm always focused on things that amount to nothing
Yeah, I think I'm a little depressed (Depressed, depressed)
Everything is mеaningless

It’s got me feeling, oh, a certain way
Seems like lately, I've been on the run
It's got me reeling every night I’m done
Keep thinking, what am I supposed to do?
My body's not working like it used to
And these bills keep piling up on me
Remember when I had no responsibilities

So take me back when I was younger
And I was still hungry, oh
Take me back when I was younger
Yeah, I got the world at my feet
Just try and stop me (Just try and stop me)
Yeah, take me back when I was younger

When they promised me that they would be here today
I wish that I could put a force field

Look out for yourself

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

[Bridge: JID]
Uh, look, okay
I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)

Can I wish on a star for another life?
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight
And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

[Chorus]
I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

[Verse 2]
I could run from it all, but I'd only get lost
Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed
And I find myself a user
Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed
They all call me a friend, but I'll never be freed
From the face of a faithless future

But I'm still here today (I'm here today)

And I think of you and all we've made it through
Some have passed away, there's no words to say
No second tries, is this my life?
And I think of you

Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely

[Verse 1]
Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no, day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

[Chorus]
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

[Verse 2]
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

She could always hear every word they say
Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears

[Chorus]
It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind, mind

[Verse 2]
Mine is broken, how is yours?
Sure, it helps to hear the news and political discourse
Fear, that is what he felt
Every single day as all the boys would play
Don't you darе be weak, emasculatеd freak
Last up on the fence, tell me, where's the sense?

[Chorus]
It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time

I'm holding my breath, holding so tight
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
I'm in the dark, looking for light
Won't someone please save my life?
Inside, I'm a mess, but I don't let it show
I'm just hanging on, but you'd never know
I smile all day, and cry through the night
Won't someone please save my
Life is fleeting

Dull knives taking my life
A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind

A smoldering flame, deep in my heart
Barely a sign, it's barely a spark
Holding on through every night
Won't someonе please save my lifе?

Invisible pain, it's filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won't someone please save
My life is fleeting, no repeating

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you walk, the way you talk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck sincе you've been gone
I've triеd to put this all behind me
But I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

[Verse 2]
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

Look out for yourself

[Verse 1]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy

Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time

I swear, that I'll never be a saint, no way
A chair in the corner is my place I stay
I shake and I think about the powers at play, the powers at play
And the kids in the dark that were doomed from the start
The child in the basement, face to the pavement
Oh, what a statement, love is embracement
Love is a constant, love is a basis
He cannot be, she cannot be, they cannot be changed
But keep on praying

I know when my day will come
Go back to the place that I came from
Lookin' back, will I think that I did it right?
I still don't sleep at night
I got these symphonies stuck in my head
And they don't leave
Fillin' up the silence with these notes
I don't want them to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Ghosts follow me around these days
Haunting my head and house
My mind is crazy loud
But I won't give in to it
Take it all in stride

[Chorus]
This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the highеr ground

I've got that golden gun
I was born as the sеventh son
Everything comes with conditions
Everyone's got their dirty dishes
I've got these memories
Stuck in my head, and they won't leave
Filling up my treetops with these crows
I wish that they would go

[Chorus]
This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the higher

Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the higher ground

Get it, got it, want it
Tell me what to do, and I'm on it
I am the witness
The genesis
The reason

Tell me what to do and I'm on it
I am the witness, the witness, the witness

That you don't have a say?
And the scarlet ""A"" on your neck

And your heart is bleeding out

I call you up just to say
How much I've thought of you today
The leaves have fall, the seasons change
Yet we remain
A year has passed, our children grow
And in their eyes, I see your soul
The sun grows bright, the rain has gone
And here we are

[Chorus]
All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
And still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you (I'm tied)

[Bridge]
Time will heal our hearts
But were we doomed from the start?
Or were we planned in the stars?
Or is there any God at all?

Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
(All this time I've spent with you)
All that we've been through

Seems there's something in the air today
It’s got me feeling, oh, a certain way
Seems like lately, I've been on the run
It's got me reeling every night I’m done
Keep thinking, what am I supposed to do?
My body's not working like it used to
And these bills keep piling up on me
Remember when I had no responsibilities

[Chorus]
So take me back when I was younger
And I was still hungry, oh
Take me back when I was younger
Yeah, I got the world at my feet
Just try and stop me (Just try and stop me)
Yeah, take me back when I was younger

[Verse 2]
Watching all my friends pass away
When they promised me that they would be here today
I wish that I could put a force field
Around every single one of us
I would protect you from everything
(I'd put a force field) All around us
And ground us forever and ever

He was never gonna make it
Every pill he found, he'd take it
Always on the edge of breakdowns
Keepin' it together somehow
Just another cold November
You called me, but I didn't answer
I was so oblivious, now, I'm askin' for forgiveness
For every single time I failed you
I'm feelin' like it's me that killed you
Rememberin' the time they jumped you
And I was too scared to help you
Looking back, I can't erase it
I guess it's time to face it
You never seemed to know how to let it all go

That you were always good at hiding
You were always asking questions, so you wouldn't draw attention

See, I wish I could take it back
Change the future and erase the past
Grab the bullet out and pull you back
I promise that I'd save your life like you saved mine
But now, it's far too late for that
And all I have is your story left to tell
So, let me tell it, let me tell

Look out for yourself

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Uh, look, okay
I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)

Can I wish on a star for another life?
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight
And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

[Chorus]
I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

[Verse 2]
I could run from it all, but I'd only get lost
Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed
And I find myself a user
Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed
They all call me a friend, but I'll never be freed
From the face of a faithless future

These years pass by and we're growing older

Some have passed away, some have moved on
But I'm still here today (I'm here today)

These years pass by and I am growing older
And I think of you and all we've made it through
Some have passed away, there's no words to say
No second tries, is this my life?
And I think of you

Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely

[Verse 1]
Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no, day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

[Chorus]
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

[Refrain]
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

[Verse 2]
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

She could always hear every word they say
Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears

[Chorus]
It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind, mind

[Verse 2]
Mine is broken, how is yours?
Sure, it helps to hear the news and political discourse
Fear, that is what he felt
Every single day as all the boys would play
Don't you darе be weak, emasculatеd freak
Last up on the fence, tell me, where's the sense?

[Chorus]
It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind

I'm holding my breath, holding so tight
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
I'm in the dark, looking for light
Won't someone please save my life?
Inside, I'm a mess, but I don't let it show
I'm just hanging on, but you'd never know
I smile all day, and cry through the night
Won't someone please save my
Life is fleeting

A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind

A smoldering flame, deep in my heart
Barely a sign, it's barely a spark
Holding on through every night
Won't someonе please save my lifе?

Invisible pain, it's filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won't someone please save

[Verse 1]
Trouble
Blood is in the rocky waters
Hide away your sons and daughters
Eat you alive
Levels
Better put your head on swivels
Dancin' with the very devil
Butter to knife
[Pre-Chorus]
You think you're better than them
Better than them
You think they're really your friends
Really your friends
But when it comes to the end
To the end
You're just the same as them
Same as them (Ha ha ha ha ha)

[Chorus]
So lеt it go, let it go
That's the way that it goes
First you'rе in, then you're out
Everybody knows
You're hot, then you're cold
You're a light in the dark
Just you wait and you'll see
That you're swimmin' with sharks

Drownin', you're seein' doubles
Don't you let them see your struggles
Hidin' your tears
Crisis
Take advantage of your niceness
Cut you up in even slices
Prey on your fears

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you're better than them
Better than them (You think you're better)

I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy

Fillin' up the silence with these notes

Haunting my head and house

And these bills keep piling up on me
Remember when I had no responsibilities

For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Ha)

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & JID]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)
(Look out for yourself)

[Bridge: JID]
Uh, look, okay
I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy

[Outro: Dan Reynolds]
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint

Can I wish on a star for another life?
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight
And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

[Chorus]
I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

[Verse 2]
I could run from it all, but I'd only get lost
Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed
And I find myself a user
Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed
They all call me a friend, but I'll never be freed
From the face of a faithless future

Sometimes, I can get a little

Sometimes, I can get a little

[Verse 1]
Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no, day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

[Chorus]
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

Wanna make you proud of me
But slowly, I am killing me
Playing with chemistry
Floating to thе ceiling
Always rock 'n' roll 'til you die, you know, you been flyin'

Grinding my teeth out

She could always hear every word they say
Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears

It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind, mind

Mine is broken, how is yours?
Sure, it helps to hear the news and political discourse
Fear, that is what he felt
Every single day as all the boys would play
Don't you darе be weak, emasculatеd freak
Last up on the fence, tell me, where's the sense?

I'm holding my breath, holding so tight
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
I'm in the dark, looking for light
Won't someone please save my life?
Inside, I'm a mess, but I don't let it show
I'm just hanging on, but you'd never know
I smile all day, and cry through the night
Won't someone please save my

Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time

A smoldering flame, deep in my heart
Barely a sign, it's barely a spark
Holding on through every night
Won't someonе please save my lifе?

Invisible pain, it's filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won't someone please save

Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

You left me, baby, for another man
He's looking tall, he's got a deep tan

Takes care of business on his cellphone

Can I wish on a star for another life?
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight
And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

[Chorus]
I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

[Verse 2]
I could run from it all, but I'd only get lost
Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed
And I find myself a user
Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed
They all call me a friend, but I'll never be freed
From the face of a faithless future

Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no, day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay

The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day

I think I was wrecked all along

But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

Remember when you got sick, cancer of the bone
Everyone in school while you're sittin' at home
In your wheelchair of grief, find no relief
We were there for the ups and downs and there for the constant rounds of chemo
Yeah, you know that you are our hero
You were there when I was a zero
And I swear I'll make things right before the long night
Swear I'll make things right tomorrow
But as for tonight

Take a hit of anything
To escape it all, I'm suffocating
A sharpened blade of reality
Sometimes, I wanna hurt me
I know it's hard to hear, but I'm
Waitin' for the new year
Don't wanna waste my life chasin' white
Try to swim towards the light

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb

Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety

[Verse 2]
Wanna make you proud of me
But slowly, I am killing me
Playing with chemistry
Floating to thе ceiling
Always rock 'n' roll 'til you die, you know, you been flyin'
Now I'm shaking at night, sweating thе sheets out
Grinding my teeth out

Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears

Sure, it helps to hear the news and political discourse

Last up on the fence, tell me, where's the sense?

I'm holding my breath, holding so tight
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
I'm in the dark, looking for light
Won't someone please save my life?
Inside, I'm a mess, but I don't let it show
I'm just hanging on, but you'd never know
I smile all day, and cry through the night
Won't someone please save my
Life is fleeting

A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time

Barely a sign, it's barely a spark
Holding on through every night
Won't someonе please save my lifе?

Invisible pain, it's filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won't someone please save

You know, you know, you know

You know, you know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if he treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right

I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

[Verse 2]
Call you up, you've been crying, crying all night
You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I wanna take you into the sunlight

Can I wish on a star for another life?
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight
And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

[Chorus]
I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

[Verse 2]
I could run from it all, but I'd only get lost
Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed
And I find myself a user
Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed
They all call me a friend, but I'll never be freed
From the face of a faithless future

Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no, day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

[Refrain]
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

[Verse 2]
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

Take a hit of anything
To escape it all, I'm suffocating
A sharpened blade of reality
Sometimes, I wanna hurt me
I know it's hard to hear, but I'm
Waitin' for the new year
Don't wanna waste my life chasin' white
Try to swim towards the light

[Chorus]
Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety

[Verse 2]
Wanna make you proud of me
But slowly, I am killing me
Playing with chemistry
Floating to thе ceiling
Always rock 'n' roll 'til you die, you know, you been flyin'
Now I'm shaking at night, sweating thе sheets out
Grinding my teeth out
But still the world will glamorize it all

Everybody walks like they just know the way

She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears

Sure, it helps to hear the news and political discourse

Last up on the fence, tell me, where's the sense?

Barely a sign, it's barely a spark

I get caught in the water, get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river, while the sun burns dim
I get tossed by the ocean, fall deep in the sand
I’m drowned out by the thunder, lost in the land

Is anyone around to see?

I’m doing it all for you
I’m ready to go

Take it as a self invitation
Take it as your own means of salvation
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it's too late for deciding
Oh, just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

I could never beat it when you needed me the most
The more I try the less you try to come
How could I live like that, how could I live like that?

Take it as your own means of vindication

Feeling a certain way
One more week until my therapy (Huh)
Won't check the news today, I know it's not okay
Doctor, don't tell me what I already know

Yeah, it's broken up inside
And I pick a distant memory
Yeah, I comb through my past
No, there's nothing wrong with that
I just need some medicine in me

Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Because thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over

I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

[Pre-Chorus]
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real

I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely

Yes, I know that I'm losing control and

And I blame it on the pressure I'm facing
I wanna take things slow

You were lookin' at me wild saying, ""Just go home,"" and

You're always saying that you read my sign and
Always wishing that I take the time but
You know that's not my speed

Find a balance in the middle of the chaos

Hoping that I make it to the end of December

But holding to the thought of another time

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

I find it kind of sad

Are the best I've ever had

I find it hard to take

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Now take it in but don't look down...

Been dreaming of this since a child

Try to take the easy way out

She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again

The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
And when I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right
And when the plane came in
She said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face
Down on the mattress one
And you hold me and we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee

(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)

[Verse 1]
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well, I'm just a slave unto the night

[Pre-Chorus]
(I bet, I bet my life)
Now remember when I told you (I)
That's the last you'll see of me? (I)
Remember when I broke you down to tears? (I)
(Woo-oooo-ooh, I bet, I bet my life)
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me (I)
I gave you hell through all the years (I)

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you

I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come runnin' home to you
(I bet, I bet my life)
I've told a million lies (I)
But now I tell a single truth (I)
There's you in everything I do (I)
(Woo-oooo-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
[Bridge]
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life

Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there

And oh, stupid things I do

But still, I find you

There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me

I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Promise you all that I had
Hopin' that you understand
Far from a perfect man

'Cause, honey, it's been a hard year
It seem like we're goin' nowhere
Cryin' inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair

Lay with me for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right

One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
I do whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom

Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
Yet a masterpiece, yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave my body and my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

Promise you all that I had
Hopin' that you understand
Far from a perfect man

It seem like we're goin' nowhere
Cryin' inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair

Lay with me for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right

Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you

While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?

They say: ""You're basic,"", they say: ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom

I was born to run, I was born for this

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]

Have a seat in the foyer, take a number

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say: ""You're basic,"", they say: ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]

Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
Yesterday

A new day, you can go
You can do anything you wanna
It's your play, swing low
Go high, anywhere you wanna
You can reach for the moon
Anywhere your dreams could take you
Go astray, fade away
Just leave it to yesterday

Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose

And wanna leave my own life behind

Have a seat in the foyer, take a number

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say: ""You're basic,"", they say: ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

[Chorus]
Forever Young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever

[Verse 1]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting thе worst
Are you gonna drop a bomb or not?

[Verse 2]
Let us die young or lеt us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Living in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

[Chorus]
Forever Young
I want to be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever Young
I want to be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?

[Verse 3]
This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

[Chorus 2]
All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope, is it just smoke and mirrors?
I wanna believe, oh
But all that I hope, is it just smoke and mirrors?
[Verse 5]
All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

[Chorus 2]
All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope, is it just smoke and mirrors?
I wanna believe, oh
But all that I hope, is it just smoke and mirrors?

[Bridge 2]
Believe
I wanna believe

[Chorus 2]

That comes crashing down on me?

[Verse 1]
If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take it in but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smilе, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Takе you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but

I've traveled all this way for something

Now take it in, but don't look down...

Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space
Oh I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
In the meantime, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away (Oh, let it drift away)

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

[Verse 2]
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh I'm wishin' I had what I've takin' for granted

Now, uh, we're gonna play a song by Taylor Swift here
I really love the melodies in this song
I think that they're just absolutely brilliant
It's really good melody writing
What? I'm serious
I love the melodies in this song, it's good

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Eh, eh
New money, suit and tie
I could read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny rumors lie?
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
Dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make a bad guy good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me, when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Woah)
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darlin', I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me, when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Woah)
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby

[Verse 3]
When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Bridge]
So darlin', darlin' stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me
[Chorus]
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one

In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love

This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

[Chorus]
All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

[Verse 2]
All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should've
Only the good die old
That's what they told me, but I don't know, woah, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to the
Things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

[Chorus]
Do you know, do you know
You're all I know? You're all I know?
When everything comes crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know

[Post-Chorus]
I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves

I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you

I bet my life, I bet my life on you

Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you

I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
I'm never changing who I am

Sing it with me
