We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
So come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go, oh

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
And then you whisper in my ear
""I know what you're doin' here""
So come on, oh, come on, oh, come on

While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

A Dustland fairytale beginning with just another white trash county kiss
In '61, long brown hair and foolish eyes
He looked just like you'd want him to, some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade

[Pre-Chorus]
Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

[Chorus]
Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was lookin' for a night gown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

[Verse 2]
A change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She said she always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinkin' ships, but we persevere
God gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know, the mind is poison

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide
Out where the dreams all hide

[Bridge]
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die

[Outro]
Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh, don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide8Embed"

Be still
Go on to bed
Nobody knows what lies ahead
Life is short to say the least
We're in the belly of the beast
Be still, wild and young
Long may your innocence reign
Like shells on a shore
May your limits be unknown
May your efforts be your own
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore

You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done

Be still
One day you'll lead
Fearlessness on your sleeve
When you come back, tell me what did you see
Was there something out there for me
Be still
Close your eyes
Soon enough, you'll be on your own, steady and straight
And if they drag you through the mud
It doesn't change what's in your blood

Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, ""Ain't we all just runaways? We got time""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

[Verse 2]
We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

[Pre-Chorus 2]

Hold each other till the morning light

Eh, I— I think the train is a way to find your way out of this life, if you get hit by it

Carrying sheet metal and household appliances through the pouring rain
They were planning on getting married after graduation
Had a little baby girl, trouble came and shut it down

In this quiet town, families are tight
Good people, they still don't deadbolt their doors at night
In this quiet town

Now banners of sorrow mark the front steps of childhood homes

And merit badge milestones with their daughters and sons

Now whenever I'm near the town, I'll find some reason to give
And I will walk with the dead and the living where I used to live
And every time I see my parents in the prime of their lives
Offering their son the kind of love he could never put down
Well, part of me is still that stainless kid, lucky

Please come down, boy
There is a place that exists
Just give it some time

If I could only find the right words
I'd sweep you off your feet again
You cut the power, but mine is raging

Can't keep my cool, I'm burning inside
A broken heart, beat barely alive
And it's harder to breathe
'Cause I couldn't make you believe
What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's biggеr than love

The streets are dripping with dеcisions of a quiet kind
Hallucinations on the shoulder of the borderline
With my experience, I'm better off just backing down
Instead of tripping through the pages of your side of town
Serrated edges of the blade are scraping over the leather
I guess we couldn't keep it together
I thought we had it covered forever

Alright, well, I'm 26 so I've lived here for 26 years
I married my high school sweetheart, so we've been marri—
We've been together 11 years
Um, I don't really travel much so I've just been here, ha-ha
Uh, I'm, I'm busy, John, you'll have to wait
Uh, my little brother, he moved into the community
And they tried to tape him to a flagpole or a tree up at the high school
So if you don't fit their mold—
Just a nice, small community, everybody knows everybody
Good place to live and to raise kids
We'll be here forever
So, yeah, it's a good area

[Verse 1]
I was born right here in Zion
God's own son
His Holy Ghost stories and bloodshed
Never scared me none

While they bowed their heads on Sunday
I cut out through the hedges and fields
Where the light could place its hands on my head
In the west hills

She's got two full-grown children
One still on the vine
And once I got to know him
I loved him like he was mine

Some nights we'd drive up the mouth of the canyon
On hillbilly heroin pills
We get out and watch the sunset
Peaceful and still

[Chorus]
And free in the west hills
Free in the west hills

[Verse 3]
When the sheriff kicked my door down
I was sleeping in my own bed
And the mess I got caught up in
Rained hard down on my head
They got me for possession
Of them hillbilly heroin pills
Enough to kill the horses that run
Free in the west hills
They got me for possession of enough to kill
The horses that run

Free in the west hills
Free in the west hills

[Verse 4]
If this life was meant for proving
I could use more years to live
But fifteen in a guardhouse
That's more than I'm willing to give
And if there really is a judgement
When He pulls my chart
He'll reject my actions
But He will know my heart

And He'll prepare a place for me
Where happiness instills
And the light puts its loving hands on my head
Free in the west hills

They got me for possession of enough to kill
The horses that run

Carrying sheet metal and household appliances through the pouring rain
They were planning on getting married after graduation
Had a little baby girl, trouble came and shut it down
Things like that ain't supposed to happen

Good people, they still don't deadbolt their doors at night

Now banners of sorrow mark the front steps of childhood homes

Out at the Salt Creek when I was young

To crown the bathing beauty of the rodeo
While her mother fights back proud tears, a young cowboy gives the nod

Hi, Beth
Oh, I was just calling you to chat with you
I'm probably going to have to get up at the buttcrack of dawn tomorrow
Oh, I hear Patsy backed out on ya tomorrow
Is she—
Damn it, John (Hmm?)
I lost that frickin’ steel line (Ugh)
Shit
Okay, it's alright
Go fucking find it
Ah, shit, I'm lookin’ man (Ha-ha, fuck)
See, I told you my head don't work right
Yeah, you don't have to tell me that
[Verse 1]
I'm in the car, I just needed to clear my head
She's in the house with the baby crying on the bed
She's got this thing where she puts up the walls so high
It doesn't matter how much you love
It doesn't matter how hard you try

[Verse 2]
We got a place with a fence and a little grass
I put this film on the windows and it looks like chapel glass
But when shе turns, it’s like the shadow of the cross don’t cast
No blеssing over our lonely life
It's like waiting for a train to pass, I don’t know when it'll pass
See The Killers LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also like[Chorus]
But I remember when she used to set the room on fire
With her eyes, swear to God
It's like a flood of grief and sorrow from a haunted life
When she cries, like a train, it's a lot

[Verse 3]
I dropped a line to a flickering high school flame
We laughed about all the ways that our lives had changed
She’s up the road, about thirty-five miles north
Got two little boys in school, just had a real bad divorce
And in a moment of weakness

[Chorus]
I told her if she ever needed a helping hand
I would lend, swear to God
It's like the part of me that's screaming not to jump gets lost
In the sound of the train, it's a lot

[Bridge]
Trying hard
Not to cave
Swear to God

[Outro]
I'm in the car outside
I'm in the car outside
I'm in the car outside

Biggest thing I'd do about drugs in high school was, uh, going out and drinkin' a beer
But, uh, it's all here now, uh, and it don't care who it hits—
There's a lot of opioids going around
It makes you feel pretty damn good
After a few hours, you gotta take more
And then after a while, you're taking a ton and you don't feel great
Everyone's just tryin' to escape something
Yep, that's it, I'm not—

[Verse 1]
Is this the life you chose yourself
Or just how it ended up?
Is that the yard you pictured when
You closed your eyes and dreamed
Of children in the grass running through the sprinklers?
Being somebody's wife?
Or were you living in another life?

[Chorus]
When will I make it home?
When I damn well feel like driving
Down these empty streets
That burn through our birthright

[Bridge]
I passed a couple of kids holding hands in the street tonight
They reminded me of us in another life

Am I the man of your desire
Or just a guy from your hometown?
Are these the arms that you saw when you
Pictured yourself wrapped around?
Baby, I can vouch for the hopeless dreamer
When you look at me
Am I the man you hoped I'd be?

[Chorus]
When will I make it home?
When that jukebox in the corner
Stops playing country songs
Of stories that sound like mine

[Bridge]
I spent my best years laying rubber on a factory line
I wonder what I would've been in another life

[Outro]
In another life
In another life

She was doing sixty in a thirty-five
I hit the lights and pulled her over
When I reached the window of the driver side
There was blood from her mouth, dry on her shoulder
I've never had much patience for guys that hit
For more than just obvious reasons
I asked if she wanted me to take him in
She laughed it off like lemonade

[Chorus]
When you're in love, you can be blinded by your own heart
You'll bend your own truth, so twisted up, you could justify sin
And when people in love are desperate enough to abandon their dreams
People do desperate things

[Verse 2]
I've been taking lunch breaks at her work
When the restaurant ain't too crowded
She knows me and my wife got a little girl
We don't talk too much about it
The other night, she met me way out west
Things went further than they should have
But when she undid the buttons of her dress
I didn't stop her, but I could have

It's our local hero sports bar

We met dragging Main at Spanish Fork
And he wasn't moving away from here, so it wasn't really—
And we could build a house here
But—

[Verse 1]
Hope'll set your eyes agleam
Like four feet dangling in the stream
But the Kingdom of God, it's a pressure machine
Every step, gotta keep it clean
A mattress on a hardwood floor
Who could ever ask for more?
I'll get up and cut the grass
Ain't nothing wrong with working class

[Chorus]
I, I don't remember the last time you asked how I was
Don't you feel the time slipping away?
It ain't funny at all
It's gonna break your heart one day

[Verse 2]
Keep the debt cloud off the kids
Only sunshine on their lids
Jiminy Cricket and Power Wheels
And memories of Happy Meals
Sometimes, I look at the stars
And think about how small we are
Sweating it out in the pressure machine
Good 'til the last drop

Butterflies don't just dance on a string

We've had that treadmill now for months
I think she might've used it once
If I shut my mouth and keep the peace
She'll cook my eggs in bacon grease
Life'll grow you a big red rose
Then rip it from beneath your nose
Run it through the pressure machine
And spit you out a name tag memory

It's just small-town filling and just living the small town an—
Like my kids ride dirt bikes and motorcycles
And they just go across the street in the field and ride
I can watch 'em off my front porch, um
My one boy's into shed-horn hunting
So he'll take off and go park his truck out west and be gone all day, and—
They— The mountains are just in our backyard
That's the nice part about it

[Verse 1]
When I get up, she swears that she don't hear it
Says that I'm as quiet as a mouse
I comb my hair and throw some water on my face
And back out of the stillness of our house
Lately, my patience is in short supply
Nothing good seems to ever come from all this work
No matter how hard I try

[Verse 2]
You know I believe in the Son, I ain't no backslider
But my people were told they'd prosper in this land
Still, I know some who've never seen the ocean
Or set one foot on a velvet bed of sand
But they've got their treasure laying way up high
Where there might be many mansions
But when I look up, all I see is sky

Coca-Cola Grin, Honeysuckle skin
Born beneath the ready sign
Of a strawberry moon
Small town girl

Small town Girl
Shows up for her friends
Crazy 'bout the bends
I was there when she first Put away childish things
Small Town Girl

We had the wind in our heels
Unraveling forces

Just like runaway Horses
In a fever 'til the end
Just like Runaway Horses
Every step is a silver prayer
In the face of a hard wind

You traded school
For wedding rings and rent, invitations sent
You and him by a barn
Out on the edge of town

Alright, well, I'm 26 so I've lived here for 26 years
I married my high school sweetheart, so we've been marri—
We've been together 11 years
Um, I don't really travel much so I've just been here, ha-ha
Uh, I'm, I'm busy, John, you'll have to wait
Uh, my little brother, he moved into the community
And they tried to tape him to a flagpole or a tree up at the high school
So if you don't fit their mold—
Just a nice, small community, everybody knows everybody
Good place to live and to raise kids
We'll be here forever
So, yeah, it's a good area

Oh yeah, oh no, the train, the train
Every two or three years, the train kills somebody
Every two or three years, yeah
Everybody knows about the train, okay?
You hear it constantly
Eh, I— I think the train is a way to find your way out of this life, if you get hit by it

[Verse 1]
A couple of kids got hit by a Union Pacific train
Carrying sheet metal and household appliances through the pouring rain
They were planning on getting married after graduation
Had a little baby girl, trouble came and shut it down
Things like that ain't supposed to happen

[Chorus]
In this quiet town, families are tight
Good people, they still don't deadbolt their doors at night
In this quiet town

[Verse 2]
When we first heard opioid stories, they were always in whispering tones
Now banners of sorrow mark the front steps of childhood homes
Parents wept through daddy's girl eulogies
And merit badge milestones with their daughters and sons
Laying there lifeless in their suits and gowns
Somebody's been keepin' secrets

In this quiet town, they know how to live
Good people who lean on Jesus, they're quick to forgive
In this quiet town

[Bridge]
Now whenever I'm near the town, I'll find some reason to give
And I will walk with the dead and the living where I used to live
And every time I see my parents in the prime of their lives
Offering their son the kind of love he could never put down
Well, part of me is still that stainless kid, lucky

[Chorus]
In this quiet town, salt of the land
Hard-working people, if you're in trouble, they'll lend you a hand
Here in this quiet town

[Outro]
The first crop of hay is up
School let out and the sun beats down
Smoke billows from a Sunday train
That cries away from a quiet townEmbed"

The parking lot is rammed with shotgun pickup trucks
At the Jones' rubber plant where all the guys end up
Beer-drinking Boy Scouts living life like they ain't stuck
On these quicksand streets with their girls in a sling
I'm in my bedroom on the verge of a terrible thing

[Verse 2]
'Round here, we all take up our cross and hang on His holy name
But the cards that I was dealt will get you thrown out of the game
Hey, mama, can't you see your boy is wrapped up in the strangle silk
Of this cobweb town where culture is king?
I'm in my bedroom on the verge of a terrible thing

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and think of the water
Out at the Salt Creek when I was young

[Verse 3]
Down at Old Mill Park, half the town's in tow
To crown the bathing beauty of the rodeo
While her mother fights back proud tears, a young cowboy gives the nod
The chute opens, bull draws blood, and the gift is accepted by God

And the glowy excitement that it builds?

Oh, my heck, so, yeah, the Ute Stampede, I mean that's a tradition for sure, um
One year, we wish— it was raining, all, like stampedes and this horse come out
And everyone, you know, said it was supposed to be the best
And it fell in the mud, and, I mean, you could see its leg just totally snapped
It was just hanging there
And the girl, you know, laid dow— it was the saddest thing
I mean, I think most of the crowd was crying
She set up and laid over her horse and just cried and hugged hеr horse
And, ’cause she knеw that, you know, that was her last moments with that horse

Born beneath the ready sign of a strawberry moon

We had spring in our heels
Unwavering forces, headfirst into the unknown

Hi, Beth
Oh, I was just calling you to chat with you
I'm probably going to have to get up at the buttcrack of dawn tomorrow
Oh, I hear Patsy backed out on ya tomorrow
Is she—
Damn it, John (Hmm?)
I lost that frickin’ steel line (Ugh)
Shit
Okay, it's alright
Go fucking find it
Ah, shit, I'm lookin’ man (Ha-ha, fuck)
See, I told you my head don't work right
Yeah, you don't have to tell me that
[Verse 1]
I'm in the car, I just needed to clear my head
She's in the house with the baby crying on the bed
She's got this thing where she puts up the walls so high
It doesn't matter how much you love
It doesn't matter how hard you try

[Verse 2]
We got a place with a fence and a little grass
I put this film on the windows and it looks like chapel glass
But when shе turns, it’s like the shadow of the cross don’t cast
No blеssing over our lonely life
It's like waiting for a train to pass, I don’t know when it'll pass

But I remember when she used to set the room on fire
With her eyes, swear to God
It's like a flood of grief and sorrow from a haunted life
When she cries, like a train, it's a lot

[Verse 3]
I dropped a line to a flickering high school flame
We laughed about all the ways that our lives had changed
She’s up the road, about thirty-five miles north
Got two little boys in school, just had a real bad divorce
And in a moment of weakness

[Chorus]
I told her if she ever needed a helping hand
I would lend, swear to God
It's like the part of me that's screaming not to jump gets lost
In the sound of the train, it's a lot

[Bridge]
Trying hard
Not to cave
Swear to God

[Outro]
I'm in the car outside

Biggest thing I'd do about drugs in high school was, uh, going out and drinkin' a beer
But, uh, it's all here now, uh, and it don't care who it hits—
There's a lot of opioids going around
It makes you feel pretty damn good
After a few hours, you gotta take more
And then after a while, you're taking a ton and you don't feel great
Everyone's just tryin' to escape something
Yep, that's it, I'm not—

[Verse 1]
Is this the life you chose yourself
Or just how it ended up?
Is that the yard you pictured when
You closed your eyes and dreamed
Of children in the grass running through the sprinklers?
Being somebody's wife?
Or were you living in another life?

[Chorus]
When will I make it home?
When I damn well feel like driving
Down these empty streets
That burn through our birthright

[Bridge]
I passed a couple of kids holding hands in the street tonight
They reminded me of us in another life

Am I the man of your desire
Or just a guy from your hometown?
Are these the arms that you saw when you
Pictured yourself wrapped around?
Baby, I can vouch for the hopeless dreamer
When you look at me
Am I the man you hoped I'd be?

[Chorus]
When will I make it home?
When that jukebox in the corner
Stops playing country songs
Of stories that sound like mine

[Bridge]
I spent my best years laying rubber on a factory line
I wonder what I would've been in another life

She was doing sixty in a thirty-five
I hit the lights and pulled her over

There was blood from her mouth, dry on her shoulder

For more than just obvious reasons
I asked if she wanted me to take him in
She laughed it off like lemonade

You'll bend your own truth, so twisted up, you could justify sin
And when people in love are desperate enough to abandon their dreams

When the restaurant ain't too crowded
She knows me and my wife got a little girl
We don't talk too much about it

But when she undid the buttons of her dress

And we could build a house here
But—

[Verse 1]
Hope'll set your eyes agleam
Like four feet dangling in the stream
But the Kingdom of God, it's a pressure machine
Every step, gotta keep it clean
A mattress on a hardwood floor
Who could ever ask for more?
I'll get up and cut the grass
Ain't nothing wrong with working class

I, I don't remember the last time you asked how I was
Don't you feel the time slipping away?
It ain't funny at all
It's gonna break your heart one day

[Verse 2]
Keep the debt cloud off the kids
Only sunshine on their lids
Jiminy Cricket and Power Wheels
And memories of Happy Meals
Sometimes, I look at the stars
And think about how small we are
Sweating it out in the pressure machine
Good 'til the last drop

Like my kids ride dirt bikes and motorcycles
And they just go across the street in the field and ride
I can watch 'em off my front porch, um
My one boy's into shed-horn hunting
So he'll take off and go park his truck out west and be gone all day, and—
They— The mountains are just in our backyard
That's the nice part about it

[Verse 1]
When I get up, she swears that she don't hear it
Says that I'm as quiet as a mouse
I comb my hair and throw some water on my face
And back out of the stillness of our house
Lately, my patience is in short supply
Nothing good seems to ever come from all this work
No matter how hard I try

[Verse 2]
You know I believe in the Son, I ain't no backslider
But my people were told they'd prosper in this land
Still, I know some who've never seen the ocean
Or set one foot on a velvet bed of sand
But they've got their treasure laying way up high
Where there might be many mansions
But when I look up, all I see is sky

Last night I saw you dressed in white
Nothing around you
You were standing in the lightning field of love
You were waiting for the lightning to come
I didn't want to wake up
I just wanted to run my fastest
And stand beside you

[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
I just wanted to run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field of love
I didn't want to wake up
I just wanted to run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field
Press your face to mine, name and raise again
Take the car out for a drive
Run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field of love
Name and raise again, press your face to mine
Run my fastest and name and raise again
Hold your hand again, speak your name again
Over heels again, tell you everything
[Bridge: K.D. Lang, Brandon Flowers]
Late at night, I lie in bed and think about things left unsaid and
All the things that I'd do different if I just had the chance
Don't beat yourself up, you laid good ground
Look at 'em all from scratch 'til sundown
You put the work in and then some
Where is all this coming from?
There's no end to love
There's no end to truth
There's no end to me
There's no end to you

I tried going against my own soul's warning
But in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving even though the sky was storming
I just wanted to get back to where you are

[Verse]
If you could see through the banner of the sun
Into eternity's eyes, like a vision reaching down to you
Would you turn away?
What if it knew you by your name?
What kind of words would cut through the clutter of the whirlwind of these days?

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried going against my own soul's warning
And in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving, even though the sky was storming
Thunderheads were forming

[Chorus]
But then I thought I could fly
And when I hit the ground
It made a messed up sound
And it kept on rattling through my days
And cutting up my nights
Like a goddamn knife
And it got me thinking, no matter how far
I just wanted to get back to where you are

You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirl's lies
And when I look back on those neon nights
The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light

[Pre-Chorus]
From Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

[Chorus]
Racing shadows in the moonlight
Through the desert on a hot night
For a second there we’d won
Yeah, we were innocent and young

[Verse 2]
Cast out of the night
You got a foolish heart
So you took your place but the fall from grace
Was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burning for love
Holding on for your life

The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you are too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
(It's a proving ground)
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
(and you turn to chance)
Your soul was innocent
She kissed him and she painted it black (on a loser's game)
You should have seen your little face
Burning for love

But you can't survive (All that I wanted was a little touch)

Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now

[Bridge]
Stupid on the streets of London
James Dean in the rain
Without her it's not the same
But it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
And keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me

[Chorus]
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

[Chorus 1]
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young

[Verse 2]
Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

[Chorus 2]
We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young

And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young
(Talks like a gentleman)

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But more than you'll ever know35Embed"

What have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry

[Chorus]
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous

And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick

[Verse 1]
I walked into town with a message for my old man
I've got the last two chapters of Matthew in my hand
Steve painting houses while Bobby went and gone insane
They buried my sister but daddy he stayed the same

Brother, just lean into the light
You wanna be sure, I’ll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light

His hands still shake when the ponies break out on the track
(Here comes the calling)
His feet still quick when they say they want their money back (Here comes the calling)
But Daddy did you think that you could outrun the Holy Ghost? (Here comes the calling)
Lie, cheat, steal, hope they fix it all up in post

This snowman is shaping up to be an eight
But not out of ten
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when
They'll break through these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains
I'm living proof it can last a long time

[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers]
Now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet
When they're all in bed
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland
Sprinkled inside their heads
And soon they will change
But tonight, Hollywood has never seemed so strange
Now mothers pray it'll last a long time

[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight, dressed in red
Through the night, on a great big sled

She was begging and a-pleading screaming ""Por favor

Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time

I got scared and I left that night

'Cause, we are living in a difficult time
We've been walking down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time

Happy Birthday Guadalupe

Deck the halls with rosaries
Wish upon a Christmas tree
Silent night please come to me
Bearing gifts from my... my Mexican angel

At night I wake up cold and lonely bursting at the seams
She haunts the early morning hours of December dreams
My Guadalupe with big brown eyes
I wanna break the spell tonight

'Cause we are living in a difficult time
We've been walking down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time

Oh, God, oh, God
Dear father in heaven
I'm not a praying man but if you're up there and you can hear me
Show me the way
I'm at the end of my road and I...
Show me the way, oh God

[Verse 1]
No more trouble in this town
Silent night for a change
A brand new year coming up ahead
You know it's been so long since I rang one in
I close my eyes, think about the path I took
Just when I think these times have gotten the best of me

[Hook]
I can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the floor
Watching television, it's a wonderful life
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin
Stomp my boots before I go back in

[Verse 2]
I wasted my wishes on Saturday nights
Boy, what I would give for just one more
I'd soften my heart, shock the world
Do you hear my voice?
Do you know my name?

Way out in Old Nevada, where the Truckee's waters flow
Where the cattle are ""a-browsing"" and the Spanish ponies grow;
Where the Northers ""come a-whistling"" from beyond the Neutral Strip;
And the prairie dogs are sneezing, as if they had ""The Grip"";
Where the coyotes come a-howling around the ranches after dark
And the bluebirds are a-singing to the lovely ""meadow lark"";
Where the bighorns are a-grazing and the lonely plovers call —
It was there that I attended ""The Cowboys' Christmas Ball""
(whoo!)

[Verse 2]
The boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles;
The ladies — ""kind of scattering"" — had gathered in for miles
The room was togged out gorgeous - with mistletoe and shawls
And candles flickered frescoes, around the airy walls
The women folk looked lovely - the boys looked kinda treed
Till the leader got to yelling: ""Hey, fellers, let's stampede!""
And the music started sighing, and availing through the hall
As a kind of introduction to ""The Cowboys Christmas Ball""

[Verse 3]
Their leader was a feller that came from Swenson's ranch
They called him ""Windy Billy,"" from ""little Dead man's Branch""
His rig was ""kinda careless,"" big spurs and high-heeled boots;
He had the reputation that come when ""a fellers shoots""
His voice was like a bugle upon a mountainous height;
His feet were animated an' a mighty, moving sight
When he commenced to hollering, ""Now, fellers stake your pen!""
""Lock horns with all them heifers, and Russel them like men
""Salute yer lovely critters; now swing and let them go
""Climb the grape vine around them — all hands do-ce-do!
""You Mavericks, join the round-up - Just skip her waterfall""

Up in the old North Pole
There lived a lump of anthracite
Whose parents called him Joel

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Happy as a lump can be
He just wants to keep Santa warm
And make the elves cozy

But Santa Claus had other plans
For Joel one fateful day
""Joel, you're just the lump I need
Come join me on my sleigh""
Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Heart leapt up with joy
""I'll soon be Santa's present to
A lucky girl or boy

We'll laugh and play together
And we'll hold each other tight
Snuggle under clean white sheets
When we go to sleep at night""

Then Santa's elves all laughed at Joel
""You're in for a surprise
You're not a special Christmas gift
You're just a booby prize
What kid would ever want you?
You're filthy as can be
Now you have to go and live
With one who's been naughty""

""But I make heat,"" poor Joel cried
""And electricity""
""You pollute the air
With CO2 and mercury""

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Fell down upon his knees
""I don't wanna live with a naughty kid
Don't make me, Santa, please""

But Santa laughed his jolly laugh
""Ho, ho, you stupid lump
You're just the thing to teach this brat
That Santa ain't no chump""

So off they flew and, before he knew
Joel was in a sack
He cried and yelled to Santa Claus
""Why don't we just go back?""

And then came Christmas morning
And, much to Joel's surprise (Much to Joel's surprise)
He saw a boy with the saddest face
And tears were in his eyes (Tears were in his eyes)

And said ""You can be my friend (Hey man, let's be friends)

It's true, I've been a naughty boy
And maybe that's a sin (Maybe that's a sin)
If this is how Santa treats the kids
I'm just glad that I'm not him""

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Knew what he must do
He said ""Now I know the reason why
I got sent to you

Cause when a person hurts inside
It turns him hard and cruel
But I know how to make your pain
Into a precious jewel

So take me in your hand, young man
And squeeze with all your might
Let's turn your pain and anger
Into something that shines bright""

Then Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
He gave his life away
So that one good naughty little boy
Had a diamond on Christmas day6Embed"

""My mother and father spent most of their lives in Henderson, Nevada. The small, dusty sidecar of Las Vegas. Henderson was just like any other town in America, only with slot machines in the laundromat. It was 1990, and Vegas was boomin', baby! But Jeanie and Terry weren't gamblers or dealers or mafiosos or lounge singers. They were just two normal people trying to keep up with the pack in a one-hundred-and-sixteen-degree rat race. And those rats; they'd nibbled long enough. Now, I don't know what a mosey looks like, but they packed up their house and their clothes and their me, and they moseyed on outta dodge. Of course, I had my gripes about leavin'. I mean, I had a life in Henderson. Kenny and Kevin Hebner were just two houses up. The desert fort behind my house wasn't gonna defend itself. But what could I do? I was nine. A nine-year-old can't just stage a sit-in while the rest of the family checks out. This wasn't a Home Alone movie, so... I went where the sweet'n'sour chicken was cooked, and the ice cold, caffeine-free Coke was just a fridge away. And just like that, from sagebrush, slot machines and Elvis to Footloose, Onion Days and Jewel. She was born there, after all. This place called Payson, Utah. God's country. Population: blink, and you'll miss it. Dad got a job in the produce department at the Smith's Food King, which was fitting since he managed to *produce* six kids: April, Shelley, Amy, Stephanie and my brother Shane were the other five. I was in fourth grade at the time, an age when boys start thinking more like men. And there wasn't a dull moment: I'd had my first fight, my first crush, my first rodeo, but most importantly my first white Christmas. I did my best to fit in, and I did as my teachers said, but that year one teacher stood out from the rest. He didn't just stand out from the rest; He sung out. His name was Mr. Hansen. And on a frosty December morning, he explained to us the story of the old standard ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". A tale of a World War II soldier stationed overseas, writing a letter to his family about the return that he may never make. I saw it struck deep in him. Now, it would be easy to describe Mr. Hansen as brave. After all, this was a man who himself had served his country during the Korean war. But getting up in front of twenty five nine-year-olds and singing a capella? That's a whole other kind of bravery altogether. The other kids were looking for the nearest escape: they couldn't bear the embarrassment. But not me. I was wrapped up in it. I couldn't help myself. I knew I was experiencing something different from the others, but I was uplifted so it didn't matter. I felt the isolation of war. I felt the power of a song, and that's the kind of thing that sticks with you. You don't let it go. And so, for this here Christmas song, I have a friend I brought along. He's eighty six, but sounds like twenty, and though the other kids might find it funny, he'd like to sing his song for you, and if he doesn't mind I might join in too.""

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
There's no one on the radar
No creature in the grove
No reason to be hateful
Life is a treasure trove

[Chorus]
And peace of mind is easy to find
When the time is right
Come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come

[Verse 2]
We'll take a ship to Cairo
We'll find the Gods, I'm told
I heard the sun is blinding
I hear the streets are gold

[Verse 3]
We'll build a bridge to Eden
And then we'll burn it down
We'll never leave, we'll never die
We'll never turn around

It's rushing though my veins
Everything we know is purpose
There's no need to stay in chains
[Verse 5]
You've got to learn to let go
Just let go and I'll let it be
And every fighter goes down
Just slow down and turn the cheek

[Chorus 4]
Because peace of mind is easy to find
When the time is right
So come away, come away, come away, come here

Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

[Verse 1]
It started with a low light
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know, I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
That was the turning point
That was one lonely night

[Verse 2]
Well, now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You'd better look it over
Before you make that leap

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was lookin' for a night gown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

[Verse 2]
A change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She said she always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinkin' ships, but we persevere
God gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know, the mind is poison

Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, ""Ain't we all just runaways? We got time""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

[Verse 2]
We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

There's a picture of us on our wedding day

You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirl's lies
And when I look back on those neon nights
The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light

[Pre-Chorus]
From Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

[Chorus]
Racing shadows in the moonlight
Through the desert on a hot night
For a second there we’d won
Yeah, we were innocent and young

[Verse 2]
Cast out of the night
You got a foolish heart
So you took your place but the fall from grace
Was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burning for love
Holding on for your life

The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you are too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
(It's a proving ground)
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
(and you turn to chance)
Your soul was innocent
She kissed him and she painted it black (on a loser's game)
You should have seen your little face
Burning for love

Holding on for your life
But you can't survive (All that I wanted was a little touch)

I drove through the desert last night
I carried the weight of our last fight
Elvis singing don't be cruel, and I wonder if you feel it too
It's like we're going under
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line
The question of my heart came to my mind

[Chorus]
If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?

[Verse 2]
Maybe a thief stole your heart
Or maybe we just drifted apart
I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust

If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young

[Verse 2]
Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go
We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live

I square up and break through the chains
And I head like a raging bull

Cut from the cloth, of a flag that

Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, ""Ain't we all just runaways? We got time""

But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

[Verse 2]
We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

I carried the weight of our last fight
Elvis singing don't be cruel, and I wonder if you feel it too
It's like we're going under
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line
The question of my heart came to my mind

[Chorus]
If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?

[Verse 2]
Maybe a thief stole your heart
Or maybe we just drifted apart
I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust

[Outro]
Holding on for your life
But you can't survive (All that I wanted was a little touch)
When you want it all (A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much)
There's another side (Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time)11Embed"

The streets of persuasion
Are plated with gold
Your heart's in the right place
But you traveled down the wrong road
Like so many before you, the gates open wide
Here come the rising tide

[Chorus]
Let's go out tonight
There's a mystery underneath the neon light
Before life and the dream collide
Because the truth's gonna come and cut me open wide
And you can't escape the rising of the tide

[Verse 2]
Keep up your appearance
You're joining the choir
With everybody singing out glory Hallelujah
The time came for your solo
But there was nowhere to hide
Here come the rising tide

[Chorus]
And the company you keep
Where they plan your crucifixion as we speak
So baby, till life and the dream collide
There's going to be a mystery underneath those neon lights

Can you tell me brother
Was I deceived or in denial?
I was there in the back of the room when you testified
With your pitchfork tongue you licked your lips and lied
We're never going to know how hard you cried
When you petitioned and your access was denied
Till the venom in your veins is satisfied
Till you suffocate and swallow down the pride
Where you can't escape, yeah you can't escape
No you can't escape the rising of the tide2Embed"

Looking out my window an angel in robe appeared and nearly pulled me apart
A million miles of freedom
A million miles of road
But I still don’t know where to start
She wrote her number down
She gave it to me
They had to scrape me off the floor
In this transient town
Waiters and dealers trying to get their foot in the door
That night I called her, she said

[Chorus]
Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life
I've been trying to find my place in the world
(I said to her)
Baby, baby, babe I got all night
To listen to the heart of a girl

I can see the time dripping down the clock
We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain
It's the one that knows us when our heads are down
It reminds us of the place from where we came
Where we came

I'm on the shore waiting for the heart of a girl

Many doors
Knock on one
Standing still, time is raging
Staring down the mouth of 100,000 guns
You're still here, you're still here
I believe that we never have to be alone
Yes I believe it's just around the bend
You can hold it in, or you can scream it on the microphone
There is no end
There is no end

[Outro]
Deep in the night, I feel a presence
Of something that was long ago, told to me
There is a hand guiding the river
The river to wide open sea
And deep in my heart, in any game
On any mountain, no I'm not afraid
Standing on stone, you stand beside me
And honor the plans that were made2Embed"

You've been cooking up a world of fear
Put your hands in things you shouldn't have known
He was riding in the danger zone
Well you had us all fooled, with your quarterback smile
And your crocodile tears, there for a while
My paradigm shifted and man you're making me shout

Walk that lonely road in a shadow of a doubt

You may wonder what the trouble costs

In the still of the night?

Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, ""Ain't we all just runaways? We got time""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

[Verse 2]
We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We can't wait til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose

Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

[Verse 3]
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other till the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

[Verse 4]
At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We can't wait till tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

[Chorus]
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

This snowman is shaping up to be an eight
But not out of ten
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when
They'll break through these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains
I'm living proof it can last a long time

[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers]
Now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet
When they're all in bed
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland
Sprinkled inside their heads
And soon they will change
But tonight, Hollywood has never seemed so strange
Now mothers pray it'll last a long time

[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight, dressed in red
Through the night, on a great big sled

Way out in Old Nevada, where the Truckee's waters flow
Where the cattle are ""a-browsing"" and the Spanish ponies grow;
Where the Northers ""come a-whistling"" from beyond the Neutral Strip;
And the prairie dogs are sneezing, as if they had ""The Grip"";
Where the coyotes come a-howling around the ranches after dark
And the bluebirds are a-singing to the lovely ""meadow lark"";
Where the bighorns are a-grazing and the lonely plovers call —
It was there that I attended ""The Cowboys' Christmas Ball""
(whoo!)

[Verse 2]
The boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles;
The ladies — ""kind of scattering"" — had gathered in for miles
The room was togged out gorgeous - with mistletoe and shawls
And candles flickered frescoes, around the airy walls
The women folk looked lovely - the boys looked kinda treed
Till the leader got to yelling: ""Hey, fellers, let's stampede!""
And the music started sighing, and availing through the hall
As a kind of introduction to ""The Cowboys Christmas Ball""

[Verse 3]
Their leader was a feller that came from Swenson's ranch
They called him ""Windy Billy,"" from ""little Dead man's Branch""
His rig was ""kinda careless,"" big spurs and high-heeled boots;
He had the reputation that come when ""a fellers shoots""
His voice was like a bugle upon a mountainous height;
His feet were animated an' a mighty, moving sight
When he commenced to hollering, ""Now, fellers stake your pen!""
""Lock horns with all them heifers, and Russel them like men
""Salute yer lovely critters; now swing and let them go
""Climb the grape vine around them — all hands do-ce-do!
""You Mavericks, join the round-up - Just skip her waterfall""

There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
[Pre-Chorus 3]
You've got to let me know

Candy talks to strangers
Thinks her life's in danger
No one gives a damn about her hair
It's lonely down on Track Street
She used to go by Jackie
The cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers
Take a number where the blood just barely dried

[Chorus]
Wait for something better
No one behind you
Watching your shadows
This feeling won't go

[Verse 2]
Crooked wheels keep turning
Children, are you learning
Acclimatized, but don't you lose the plot
A history of blisters
Your brothers and your sisters
Somewhere in the pages we forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a number Jackie
Where the blood just barely dried
You know I'm on your side

You got to be stronger than the story
Don't let it blind you
Rivers are shallow
This feeling won't go

Your sky is full of dreams
But you don't know how to fly
I don't have a simple answer
But I know that I could answer
Something better

Over the Sierra
Stranded on the heat wave
Burning with desire
She was on the sidewalk
Looking for a nightlife
Talked about the real thing
And drove into the fire
Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Are spilling with the rain
Candy apple red dress
Bleeding when she kissed me
Heaven in a rag top
Takes away my-my pain

When your highs are low

Vacancy was buzzing
Pink and dirty neon
Settled on the hood
Wrapped her arms around me
Come a little closer
Stumbled in the twilight
And fell onto the floor of the Mona Lisa
Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door

When your highs are low

Lose the will to go

A glorious existence
A simple celebration
A place you never been before

How do you know that you're right?

I awoke on the roadside
In the land of the free ride
And I can't pull it any longer
The sun is beating down my neck
So I ran with the devil
Left a trail of excuses
Like a stone on the water
The elements decide my fate
Watch it go

You say it's hard enough to live
Don't tell me that it's over, stand up

But I'm pushing on for that horizon

I hit the bottom with a ""huh!"", quite strange
I get my glory in the desert rain
Watch it go (When I offer you survival)

Console me in my darkest hour
Convince me that the truth is always gray
Caress me in your velvet chair
Conceal me from the ghost you cast away

[Chorus 1]
I ain't in no hurry
You go run and tell your friends I'm losing touch
Fill their heads with rumors of impending doom
It must be true

Console me in my darkest hour
And tell me that you always hear my cries
I wonder what you've got conspired
I'm sure it dawns a consolation prize

You go run and tell your friends I'm losing touch
Fill the night with stories, the legend grows
Of how you got lost
But you made your way back home

It started with a low light
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know, I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites

I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She said she always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinkin' ships, but we persevere
God gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know, the mind is poison

Leaves are fallin' down on the beautiful ground
I heard a story from the man in red
He said, ""The leaves are fallin' down, such a beautiful sound
Son, I think you'd better go ahead""
But you always hold your head up high
'Cause it's a long, long, long way down
This town was meant for passing through
Boy, it ain't nothin' new
Now go and show 'em that the world stayed round
But it's a long, long, long way down

[Pre-Chorus]
You better run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
I just want to show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go

[Chorus]
Or should I just get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
Well, this river is wild

Now Adam's taking bombs and he's stuck on his mom
Because that bitch keeps trying to make him pray
He's with the hippie in the park, combing over the dark
Just trying to get some of that little-girl play

You better run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn

I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night

The pain is hell in me tonight
Because this river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild

Now the cars are everywhere, raisin' dust at the fairground
I don't think I ever seen so many headlights

Come with me

We're gonna look at the stars
We took a backroad in my car
Down to the ocean
It’s only water and sand
And in the ocean we'll hold hands

But I don't really like you, apologetically dressed in the best, put on a heartbeat glide
Without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky, and on the cold wet dirt I cry
And on the cold wet dirt I cry

[Chorus]
Don’t you wanna come with me? Don’t you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It's only natural

[Verse 3]
A cinematic vision ensued
Like the holiest dream
There's someone calling
An angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same:
""Wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine.""
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind
I always hear them when the dead of night
Comes calling to save me from this fight
But they can never wrong this right

Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type

I guess I changed my mind

Bleeding when she kissed me

A Dustland fairytale beginning with just another white trash county kiss
In '61, long brown hair and foolish eyes
He looked just like you'd want him to, some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade

[Pre-Chorus]
Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

[Chorus]
Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was lookin' for a night gown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

[Verse 2]
A change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She said she always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinkin' ships, but we persevere
God gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know, the mind is poison

[Pre-Chorus]
Castles in the sky sit stranded vandalized
We're drawbridges closin'

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide
Out where the dreams all hide

[Bridge]
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die

[Outro]
Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh, don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide8Embed"

Candy talks to strangers
Thinks her life's in danger
No one gives a damn about her hair
It's lonely down on Track Street
She used to go by Jackie
The cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers
Take a number where the blood just barely dried

[Chorus]
Wait for something better
No one behind you
Watching your shadows
This feeling won't go

[Verse 2]
Crooked wheels keep turning
Children, are you learning
Acclimatized, but don't you lose the plot
A history of blisters
Your brothers and your sisters
Somewhere in the pages we forgot

Far from the evergreen of old Assam
Far from the rainfall on the trails of old Saigon
Straight from the poster town of scorn and Ritz
To bring you the wilder side of gold and glitz

Run neon tiger there's a lot on your mind
They promised just to pet you, but don't you let them get you
Away, away, oh, run
Under heat of the southwest sun

Took to the spotlight like a diamond ring
Came from the woodwork in the hopes they might
Redeem themselves from poor decisions to win big

[Chorus 2]
Run neon tiger there's a lot on your mind
They'll strategize and maim you, but don't you let them tame you
You're far too pure and bold
To suffer the strain of the hand and its hold

[Bridge]
I don't want to be kept, I don't want to be caged
I don't want to be damned, oh hell
I don't want to be broke, I don't want to be saved
I don't want to be S.O.L
Give me rolling hills and tonight can be the night
That I stand among the thousand thrills
Mister cut me some slack, cause I don't want to go back
I want a new day and age
Come on girls and boys, everyone make some noise!

Here in my house, time is sweet
I hear the children playing in the street
Out where the hot winds blowing gentle breeze

[Chorus]
I don't need time, I don't need time
No, I can get by myself
I don't need time, I don't know why
The summer wind did not tell
I scramble on line and I know that I
Will never be calm and well
But I can get by in the meantime by myself

He's a real winner, all over they say
Sleeping in the lazy afternoon
A danger to their daughters they assume

Live it down, baby don't talk that much
Baby knows, but baby don't tease me

Drown in the dark, or we could go sailing

Always here, always on time
Close call, was it love, or was it just easy?

Steady, boys, I'm thinking she needs me
I was just sipping on something sweet
I don't need political process

The good old days, the honest man
The restless heart, the Promised Land
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze
Oh, well, I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go, can you read my mind?

Waiting on some sign

With magic soaking my spine

Come with me

We took a back road
We're gonna look at the stars
We took a backroad in my car
Down to the ocean
It’s only water and sand
And in the ocean we'll hold hands

But I don't really like you, apologetically dressed in the best, put on a heartbeat glide
Without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky, and on the cold wet dirt I cry
And on the cold wet dirt I cry

Don’t you wanna come with me? Don’t you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?

A cinematic vision ensued
Like the holiest dream
There's someone calling
An angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same:
""Wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine.""
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind
I always hear them when the dead of night
Comes calling to save me from this fight
But they can never wrong this right

I caught up with a friend in Dallas
We took a trip to New Orleans
Those black-eyed ladies
Won't say they're sorry

[Verse 3]
We finally caught a train to Memphis
Where everybody talks the same
Those blue suede babies
All know my name

And I said hold tight
Can't you see that it's hurting me

Hold on, you're just a gambling man, all proper like

Shut your mouth and wave goodbye

Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started this old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh Ruby, I still need some company

[Verse 3]
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

[Verse 4]
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same

You can fall for chains of gold

When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
It's not so bad, it's not so bad
How do you know that you're right?

[Verse 1]
I awoke on the roadside
In the land of the free ride
And I can't pull it any longer
The sun is beating down my neck
So I ran with the devil
Left a trail of excuses
Like a stone on the water
The elements decide my fate
Watch it go

[Chorus 1]
When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
Don't tell me that it's over, stand up
Poor and tired, but more than this
How do you know that you're right?
If you're not nervous anymore
It's not so bad, it's not so bad

I feel my vision slipping in and out of focus
But I'm pushing on for that horizon
I'm pushing on
Now I've got that blowing wind against my face
So you sling rocks at the riptide
Am I wrong or am I right?
I hit the bottom with a ""huh!"", quite strange
I get my glory in the desert rain
Watch it go (When I offer you survival)

[Chorus 2]
When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
And I'll tell you when it's over, shut up
Poor and tired, but more than this
How do you know that you're right?
If you're not nervous anymore
It's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Bridge]
Higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out of the fire
Higher and higher, higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out of the fire
Higher and higher, higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out, whoa-oh-oh

We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
So come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go, oh

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
And then you whisper in my ear
""I know what you're doin' here""
So come on, oh, come on, oh, come on

Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick

I know what you want
I'm gonna take you to a midnight show tonight
If you can keep a secret
I got a blanket in the back seat on my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And a little place that sits beneath the sky
She turned her face to speak, but no one heard her cry

[Chorus 1]
""Drive faster, boy
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh""

[Verse 2]
I know there's a hope
There's too many people tryin' to help me cope
You got a real short skirt
I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah, yeah
We were just in time
Let me take a little more off your mind
There's somethin' in my head, somewhere in the back, sayin'
""We were just a good thing, we were such a good thing""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Make it go away without a word
But promise me you'll stay and fix these things I've heard

Oh, make it go away, oh
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh

[Pre-Chorus 3]
A crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
Of stars in atmosphere and watched her disappear

[Chorus 3]
Into the midnight show
A-faster, a-faster, a-faster, a-faster, faster, a-faster
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep it if you can keep a secret

To say the least, I thought I'd seen them all
But then you took me by surprise

Michael plays with stars
Soul Sister won't you take a ride in his car
Late to call
When you wanted to be all
Baby, baby, don't be so shy
Rock children hold your heads up high
In the night while I try
And tell the ballad of Valentine

You got it bad, but you know it's true

[Verse 2]
I caught up with a friend in Dallas
We took a trip to New Orleans
Those black-eyed ladies
Won't say they're sorry

[Verse 3]
We finally caught a train to Memphis
Where everybody talks the same
Those blue suede babies
All know my name

[Chorus]
And I said hold tight
Can't you see that it's hurting me
But I've got the buzz
Like Marlon Brando
Michael Valentine, can't we unite?

Hold on, you're just a gambling man, all proper like
I broke to the right and I caught your eye
Shut your mouth and wave goodbye
Tonight, I am not going to let you rain on this parade

And I said hold tight
Can't you see that it's hurting me
But I've got the buzz
Like Marlon Brando
Straight-faced with misery tonight

And I will not lie when I say I am not cold no more

And I've got a coat tail left to ride

Keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me

Yeah, she's got a criminal mind, he's got a reason to pray
His life is under the gun, he's got to hold every day
Now he just wants to wake up, yeah, just to prove it's a dream
'Cause she's an angel for sure, but that remains to be seen

You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

[Verse 2]
It wasn't me that started this old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh Ruby, I still need some company

[Verse 3]
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

[Verse 4]
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

They wanna help you to grow
And then siphon all your dough

Why don't you find out for yourself?
Sick down to my heart
Well that's just the way it goes

They know the full extent of your distress
They kneel and pray
And they say:

And I just can't look, it's killin' me

Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

[Verse 2]
I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
(It was only a kiss), it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his
