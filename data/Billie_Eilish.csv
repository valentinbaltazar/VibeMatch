I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I can never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, yeah
Call me when you're there
Said, ""I bought you something rare""
And I left it under ""Claire""
So now she's coming up the stairs
So I'm pulling up a chair
And I'm putting up my hair
I could eat that girl for lunch, yeah, she

There's a part of me that recognizes you
Do you feel it too?
And you told me your every secret
Are you serious? Mm
They told me they're only curious

What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Mehki Raine & Billie Eilish]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then (my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no)
Careful

Haha, you're obsessed

Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean

I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, eyes)

I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged

[Verse 2: Live Billie Eilish, FINNEAS]
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged

[Chorus: Live Billie Eilish]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)

I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew

And left them by the stairs

And don't try to make me feel bad

But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen (Ha)
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh-oh
You ready to sing this part
Sing

You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here (I think I hate it here)
Maybe I should think about a new career (Uh)
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth, yeah)
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh-oh

Distract myself with pornography

That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy

'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel

And don't try to make me feel bad

London, how you feeling?
(Okay)
Mm-mm, I

[Verse 1]
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a ""You mad at me?"" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset
Haha, you're obsessed

[Chorus]
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean

[Verse 2]
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, eyes)
But looks can be deceivin', uh
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't deserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so

Love you

[Verse 1]
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy

[Chorus]
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

[Verse 2]
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

[Outro]
Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should, but I could never hate you

I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin'-
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
Sing
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)
Thank you London
Goodnight

So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer

Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?

I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while

When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive

I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

[Verse 2]
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night

And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty

What if you were remote? No one knows where you are
If you changed anything, would you not have survived?

Welcome, it's Billie, and this is Happier Than Ever, the first time I am doing my album all in one back to back, so, I'm Billie

[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged

[Verse 2]
Last week, I rеalized I crave pity
When I rеtell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged

[Chorus]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm

[Chorus]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm
Things I'm longing for, mmm
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

[Outro]
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's timeEmbed"

Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?See Billie Eilish LiveGet tickets as low as $116You might also likeEmbed"

Your world's an ideal

I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged

[Verse 2]
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged

[Chorus]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong

Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)

Go home, don't tell

You're sacred and they're starved
And their art is gettin' dark
And there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart

Was the last straw for me and I knew

Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs

You'd be gone for hours

Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?See Billie Eilish LiveGet tickets as low as $116You might also like33Embed"

And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way

If everybody goes

But not about you

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)

Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma

Open up to the night
Our bed is underneath a heavy moon
Cast a doubt
Like a shadow walking through the corners of the room
I always thought I'd have a full tank to go
(But not tonight, you're running low)
I always thought I'd find my own way

[Pre-Chorus]
What's going on in your head now?
Maybe something I said?
I know that you've been living in the past
What's going in your head now?
Maybe something I said

[Chorus]
It's driving me crazy, and you can try to lie
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside, you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
You can't deny my love

[Verse 2]
The eyes of God are watching over us
So we don't break the golden rule
The seven seas, have we learned
Or are we sailing on a ship of fools?
I always thought I had a full tank to go
(But not tonight, you're running low)
I always thought we'd get there someday

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

[Chorus: Billie Eilish with Khalid]
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

[Verse 2: Khalid with Billie Eilish]
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

[Chorus]
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Verse 2]
Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of you’s gone, every time you done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

[Chorus]
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can’t fly unless you let yourself fall

Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?

Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again

Yes I've been taught, got a little of it

You're better off, I'm glad that he's gone
He's gone, he's gone
You're better off, I'm glad that he's gone

[Verse 1]
I got a girlfriend, she's got a boyfriend
She calls me crying every day 'cause they got problems
He likes complaining, she's compromising
Coming to me for real advice when he just playing
I can tell she loves him way too deep
He loves being fucking hard to please
Cover the basics, it's pretty easy
He's a bitch with some expectations

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you go down on his birthday? (Yup)
Did you let him leave a necklace? (Yup)
Or did you show him all your crazy? (No)
Blow him up on the weekends? (Mmm)
Did you give in to his ego
Just to give a little confidence?
I think you know it's time to let go

One, two, three, four, tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights, that is what my youth was for
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing, but they want some more

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are

[Verse 2]
Sweetheart, bitter heart, now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are

[Bridge]
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten

Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, ""A tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you

That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there

You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?

I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
That's why I fucked yo' bitch, you fat mothafucka!

(Take money) (You know) You know who the realest is
(Take money) Niggas, we bring it too
That's a'ight, haha
(Take money) Haha
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
First off, fuck yo' bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A., some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Hahaha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Mu', pass the MAC and let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!

Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, mothafucka, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (Haha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Mothafucka, I hit 'em up!
[Verse 4: Kadafi]
I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring the drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Little Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

[Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]
You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face, you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
'Bout to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Lil' Caesar in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run, hahahaha

But we ain't singin', we bringin' drama
Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!

Now, when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth with a motherfuckin' opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this: Fuck Mobb Deep! Fuck Biggie!
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew!

Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

[Refrain]
(Hurry, I'm worried)

[Verse 2]
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you'rе gonna die, not by mistake

So, wherе did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie
Bounce with me everybody, come on

[Bridge]
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

[Refrain]
(Hurry, I'm worried)

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie2Embed"

""Getting Older"" was tough to write, you know, 'cause it's a very revealing song and it's talking about things that I, only at the time, had just felt like I realized about myself and felt insecure about, and wanted to talk about, and... I don't know, I think that that happens a lot and it should be completely... welcomed, is realizing stuff years later [laughs].

I don't know one woman that hasn't been taken advantage of. I just think it should be talked about more because I think that... it's waaay too normalized how many young women are taken advantage of.See Billie Eilish LiveGet tickets as low as $116Embed"

Credeai că urma să apar într-o limuzină? (Nu)
A trebuit să-mi strâng bani pentru pază
Am un stalker umblând pe străzi
Spune că-i Satana și c-ar vrea să ne vedem
Am cumpărat o casă pe furiș la șaptesprezece ani
N-am avut nicio petrecere încă de când am primit cheile
Am chemat un frumușel, dar n-a putut să stea
În timp ce pleca l-am pus să semneze un NDA
Da, l-am pus să semneze un NDA
O dată a fost destul
Că nu vreau s-aibă nimic ce să spună-ay, ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy

Nu m-ai putut salva, dar nu mă poți lăsa, oh, nu
Pot să tânjesc după tine, dar nu trebuie să știi tu asta, oh-oh

Treizeci sub treizeci pentru încă un an la rând (Încă un an)
De abia pot sa ies afară, cred că urăsc să stau aici (Cred că urăsc să stau aici)
Poate c-ar trebui să mă gândesc la o altă carieră
Undeva în Kaua’i unde pot să dispar
M-am tot distrat (Distrat, distrat, distrat) timpul tot trece
Nu mi-am schimbat numărul, l-am făcut să tacă
Măcar i-am dat motiv sa plângă
M-am gândit la viitor, dar cred că-l vreau acum, oh-oh

Got friends but can't invite them

But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Is there a 12 step just for you?

Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away

No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Pre-Chorus]

Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto

You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
Hmm

I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud

And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter

But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

Would you break it, if you're honest?

Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake

Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down

And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now, wow
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight

Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Verse 2]
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

[Bridge]
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Outro]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie149Embed"

Is there a 12 step just for you?

Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away

No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it

[Pre-Chorus]

Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto
[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

And get you connected?

It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet

You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay

See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet

But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be

Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again

Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire

I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage

[Verse 2]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

But that's stubborn, baby, leading to war

Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to

That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me

Hey, leave a message

[Verse 1]
Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay"" and ""blah blah blah""
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday

But this feels right, so stay a sec

Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak

Like you mishear all my songs

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll hear ""stay"" and ""blah blah blah""
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

[Chorus]
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
""It's not you, it's me"" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor64Embed"

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage

[Verse 2]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

But that was made for a ring
I try to wait for the storm to calm down
But that's stubborn, baby, leading to war

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Pre-Drop]
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
I remember you

[Drop]

(Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me)
(Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?)

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain

Would roses bloom?
(They're playing our sound
Laying us down tonight)
Could roses bloom?
(And all of these clouds
Bringing us back to life)
But I remember you

[Drop]

(Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me)
(Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?)

I've been watching you
For some time
Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Astronomyy]

A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind

Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
