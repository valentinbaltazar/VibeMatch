Hey there you, looking for a brighter season (Yeah)
Need to lay your burden down (Haha)
Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling (Dutty, young blood sucka')
Buried under deeper ground (Uh)
Yeah, okay, uh, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
I seem depressed, always being bothered, never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a check
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast, huh

[Chorus: Laura Mvula & XXXTENTACION]
Uh, give me a sec, look
Okay, okay

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
If death is what it seems
Why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor
Mind's full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate
Your conversates, hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions, then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then 'cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acuras
Accurate facts put the black, in fact, if you thought that
You are free, you should disregard that, all facts

Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go

Hate myself, but it won't show, I
Constantly lose all my remorse, and it's
Ten for the wolf and three for the shepherd, and it's
One for the sheep who led by your leopard, often
Gave his perception as a handle of weapon, took a
Bite of your apple, give me all you can offer, now I'm
Trapped in a changing maze, settin' my soul ablaze
Couldn't control the pace, where is this going, hey?
Heartless is recklessness, it's word of a pacifist to
Word of a masochist, I'm off of the map, my Lord, I
Spoke to a Baphomet, he said he would save me if I
Gave him one thing he needed, ""What is this thing?"", I pleaded
Boy, it's the key to even, yeah

[Outro]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
""What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine""

Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot

My God, it hurts, I can't be calm

I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?

Or the semi-TEC at school, what's the bigger threat?
Intellect mixed with inner stress
That's a recipe for disaster
If you don't believe me, go ask any chef
School shooter, I just need mental help
Saved by the bell, I can't hear the bell
Give me bad grades, I don't give a F
Get in front of my classmates and kill myself

I thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt when it's sore
It's going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION & Noah Cyrus]
(I thought you got all you came for)
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my self
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION, Noah Cyrus, Both]
Ah-ah
Are you tasting me?
But I miss you and I hate you
Ah-ah
But I need you, and I love you more
Every minute
Ah-ah
In January, and December, I want you
Ah-ah

Oh, just to turn away, and you'll be golden (Hello, hello)

Push drugs in my pocket
I'ma pull it out and then pop it

Cocaine
Cocaine

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Two shots for me and fuckin' Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking bucklin' up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fuckin' him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written and such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fuckin' nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so
If there's a fucking ***, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And shower solutions to the black and the white
And endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cult scripture, we're all used to be causin' a ruck
Drownin' women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of himself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Slow dancin' with the devil in a burnin' room
Two-steppin' ahead until they lock me in a tomb
Been doomed since they pulled us out the womb
Satan preyin' on me, she been throwin' souls inside the wombs
Life shouldn't eat you up, spit you out, beat you up
But, bitch, the third eye stay open, don't think I blink enough
Maybe I see too much, baby, I can't call it
I leave my soul in these bars like a alcoholic
I can't trust nobody
I'll put that on my mind, soul, and my whole body
I see demons, and there's nothin' they don't know about me
No matter how much I try to hide, they gon' find me
So now I never run from it 'cause I come from it
I never lied, I resides in the beast's stomach
I looked the Devil in the eyes, I could see she bluffin'
I pull the red dress to the side, tell her keep cummin', keep cummin'

I just found out family and enemies could be different
I was steppin' over syringes that's in my kitchen
After mama died, I couldn't go to the bathroom
Without gettin' some second-hand heroin high while pissin'
This is just me paintin' a picture of what I live with
What you know about comin' home to your shit missin'
And findin' out the niggas that helped you look for it had did it?
This is just me paintin' addiction
These niggas took methamphetamine, ketamine, edibles, and a bean
Niggas stole my denim jeans, Den of Thieves DVD, literally anything
Food I bought from the vending machine
Credit card crack any door like janitor keys
Niggas even took credit for the man I would be (Ah)
And if I let him, he would probably take twenty percent, manager fee
I'm so scared of my genes, I considered celibacy
Afraid I would ruin my seeds, like Adam and Eve
I got blood on the fuckin' leaves of my family tree
Just give me one damn minute, this shit is hard for me
I lost my whole damn mama, I lost a part of me
She lost her whole damn life from symptoms of poverty
Grew up with Crown Fried Chicken cloggin' my arteries
Increase in robberies, police and bullets that I bob and weave
It was nonstop for me, no one is stoppin' me
Either fulfill myself or be a self-fulfillin' prophecy
This just how I introduce myself properly

What are you doing out in the middle of this field leaving your car?
I'm just not sure what he's thinking
He's getting back into his car, he's grabbed his bag
And from our vantage there's no one around him
You know, you wait for these things to end, but then you figure how it might wind up
He's completely alone
This is really starting to worry me, I gotta tell ya
I gotta tell ya

[Verse 1: ikabodVEINS]
I been speakin' to the reaper, seein' spirits when I'm sleepin'
I been creepin' with them demons, shadows walk through the flames
Sippin' blood with the leeches, fuck the god you believe in
When I look in the mirror, all I see is disgrace
All of this rage, feelin' my face
Blood on the end of my blade
Can't complain, everything okay
Scars on my heart from feelin' this pain
Got a knife in my back, can't kill me though
Numb to it all, my feelings froze
Pray to the sky, Lord, give me hope
Bitch, I'm born alone and die alone, mmh
K holes in my halo, slave for the peso
Middle finger, fuck that
Land of the free, feed can to the teens
Never trust police, bitch, I bust back
Fuck the government, never trust that

To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less, but to say more, was ideal with this project, and to let my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way, but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show the open- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my, my genius, my energy. EnjoyYou might also like27Embed"

I can't seem to find someone's shoulder
Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over

[Verse]
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?

[Outro]
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, ""What's my worth?""

She put my heart beneath her feet

Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of the hardest ever (Yeah)
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas (Bang)
And bomb whatever, say we don't move calmly, never (No)
This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort
No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra

No te preocupes, me gustan mayor

Baby, bring you closer, let me show you what to do
Move it side to side, I know you want a drink or two
Let me have your body, let me show what I can do

Cuando chupa ella sí se pone loca (-a, -a, -a)
Hazlo lento pero quítate la ropa (-a, -a, -a)
Enséñame rodillas y abre boca (-a, -a, -a), ah, ah, ah

—ference, but a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about the great things that we're doing with the secretary on the Veterans Administration.  And we will talk about that very much so in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville. So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular, I want to thank—

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you, I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you, my heart has gone as still as a corpse
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you, I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you, my heart has gone as still as a corpse

[Verse: XXXTENTACION & Donald Trump]
Why the fuck should I apologize? Country's orderless, it's a lie
By these fuckin' government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future, it's right in my hands
And the future of many youth, if I play my cards can advance, and-
Genuine dime, I opened my mind, and where can I find this future?
Sever your mind or you will be blind, and trapped in a mind of lies within our walls
I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides) The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

Man, it's been a horrible four months without you. I've been in the worst pain in my life. It's been so crazy, some... sometimes I forget how to eat, or sleep, I hardly even function right. I miss... it's so weird not calling you every day, making sure you're okay. Sometimes we'd talk for hours, sometimes we'd talk for minutes, talk about all types of things. Sometimes we'd joke around, sometimes talk about some deep conversations. To being at your house every weekend for six months straight playing League with Illie, Rico, and Leo, to being on Ice and Will, to riding out on... on the road, and just talking about life and have so many ideas just bouncin' back to each other. Listening to the new, listening to the albums, to the music. You taught me so much these last few years. You taught me how to be a man, how to assert control. Taught me how, how to deal with certain things didn't need to be dealt with, how to block out the negativity, and all that energy I didn't need. I could go on and on forever, for all the memories we had, but damn. Think I've shared so much, it's like every time we got off the phone, the last time, the last time we talked, the last thing you said was, ""I love you."" I love you, Jah. Thank you for everything.8Embed"

I can tell the Ice Hotel is where my heart is cold as mucus from a snail
I remember to remember life is a bitch, so, no, I could never kiss-n-tell
And wish me well 'cause life is hell
And double the C 'cause a nigga only care 'bout Chanel
I been knockin' knees with birds and bees
Been overseas with bitches who don't speak English well
Like a owl, who?
The only enemy here is you
Uh, like bling, blow, kapoof
Fairly Odd Fairy 'done stole my tooth
No cap on cat, no Dr. Seuss
Eat flapjacks, double cup of syrup too
'Cause I only want the neck like a noose on goose
And I'm only wildin' out when I'm loose off Goose

In prison, and these chains is stuck to our wrists
And my eyes glisten when I'm reminiscin'
And my head droppin', I'm reminded that I'm empty

Now is in pieces, I bawled
Cried and I weeped for Jah
Vision I seek so bold
Alone, we're weak, but we're strong
Together, see, haha
The rain still continues to fall, pain continues to call
Sayin' not much of at all, so balance is where I'll start
I know they judgin' my heart, can't even blame them at all
I know I fucked up, and I'll apologize for my flaws
Lost on a train made of thought
I hope my end is my start
I hope that Jah see my heart
I know I'm God in my mind
But God is still who I call

Pay attention to what you're doing in your life ‘cause your life is right in front of you, everything you need is right in front of you. Even if you're broke, even if you're broke, dead broke, it's because it's supposed to be like that and everything – the people who struggle the most or get it the hardest will succeed in the end, I promise you. You will not have the hardest life forever. Everything will come to you, what you deserve will come to you. And if I end up getting shot and killed for what the fuck I'm doing, or if I end up getting my ass beat at some point in time, or, or, nigga, if shit get hard on me, it's 'cause I deserve it. That's point-blank-period. Everybody will get a death that's – everybody will get a death that is deserving, everybody will get a life that is deserving, everybody – you will get what the fuck you deserve.

What is truly at the essence?
Sharp teeth in the chest
Cancer all in the breast
Of the beaten and bruised
Feelin' like a pawn to the greed of these fools
But I never been a piece of the evil
In the womb of these fake fuck niggas
With they masks up, presume
I'll be telling, if I got a load, I swear I resume
On my conquest
For the key to the chest where my mind slept
And the love in my heart is a cancer
And I spread it through the wall as an answer
To the cries of the dead and the vanquished
The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's
Preservation of the peace, an ideal world
Never lonely when you flowin' through my mind, girl
I apologize, 'cause I couldn't see the pain in your damn eyes
'Cause a nigga made you leave with your heart in between different pains

So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down Stony, ayy
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don't negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwin' rocks at your graves
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it, all the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man, so I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin', no more lames is hanging
No more fame in famous, ain't no shame in shamin'
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman's terms, while you wait on arraignments
'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?

To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less, but to say more, was ideal with this project, and to let my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way, but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show the open- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my, my genius, my energy. EnjoyYou might also like27Embed"

My God, it hurts, I can't be calm

I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?

She put my heart beneath her feet

He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

I keep a razor blade tucked on me, under my tongue
Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of the hardest ever (Yeah)
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas (Bang)
And bomb whatever, say we don't move calmly, never (No)
This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort
No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra

[Verse 1: Carlos Andrez]
Mamita, vente, olvida la gente
Sé que tu cuerpo me pide calor
Y sé lo que siente', la noche te prende
No te preocupes, me gustan mayor
Girl, you know you got me feeling you the way you move
Baby, bring you closer, let me show you what to do
Move it side to side, I know you want a drink or two
Let me have your body, let me show what I can do
Mami, eres tú quien me provoca (-a, -a, -a)
Cuando chupa ella sí se pone loca (-a, -a, -a)
Hazlo lento pero quítate la ropa (-a, -a, -a)
Enséñame rodillas y abre boca (-a, -a, -a), ah, ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus: Judah]
Mami, what you doing all alone in the club?
Baby, catch a vibe and pour up another cup
Girl, I wanna get you all alone out the club
Get up in my ride, I wanna show you love

[Chorus: Judah]
Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight
Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y

I can feel you when you dance, you grabbing all on my pants
I'm kissing you in advance, baby, live it up
She putting me in a trance, I'm throwing out all my bands
She yelling that this a jam, DJ, turn it up

[Bridge: Rio Santana]
She want it, she want it
We going hard 'til 6 in the morning
She need it, she need it
I bet the neighbors know my name when she moan it

—ference, but a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about the great things that we're doing with the secretary on the Veterans Administration.  And we will talk about that very much so in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville. So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular, I want to thank—

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you, I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you, my heart has gone as still as a corpse
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you, I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you, my heart has gone as still as a corpse

[Verse: XXXTENTACION & Donald Trump]
Why the fuck should I apologize? Country's orderless, it's a lie
By these fuckin' government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future, it's right in my hands
And the future of many youth, if I play my cards can advance, and-
Genuine dime, I opened my mind, and where can I find this future?
Sever your mind or you will be blind, and trapped in a mind of lies within our walls
I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides) The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?

17
A collection of nightmares, thoughts, and real-life situations I've lived
17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head
My own personal number
Soon to be explained in future interviews or instances
By listening to this album, you are literally
And I cannot stress this enough, literally entering my mind
And if you are not willing to accept my emotion and hear my words fully, do not listen
I do not value your money; I value your acceptance and loyalty
Here is my pain and thoughts put into words
I put my all into this
In the hopes that it will help cure, or at least numb your depression
I love you, thank you for listening

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, but you're falling back down

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Trapped in a concept, falsely accused, misused
And misled, bitch, I'm hopin' you fuckin' rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fuckin' comfortin'
And I can't seem to shake this fuckin' feeling in my…
Uh
Cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken
I'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd probably dance on my grave
Inside my head, I see your face, I fuckin' hate that I love you still
(Yeah)
(Down)

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Carry on, life flies so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies so just carry on

The pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Turning
Twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all, at allYou might also like142Embed"

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm doin' drugs so I can maintain
Part of the reason that I can handle this damn pain
""I'm fuckin' numb"", said the lonely heart of the drummer boy
Who'd rather wreak havoc than play around wit' a Tonka toy
Uh, shit, my mirror ain't been clearer lately
I see my mind becomin' blind, material mistaken
Heart indulgin' in the things that are forever broken
I seen a father lose his son, why life so fuckin' hopeless?
Uh, ayy, concept of my depression is
That there's no fuckin' recollection when your birth begins
And there's nobody there to hold you when the pain begins
But there's somebody there to fold you when you're cavin' in
Uh, yuh, such discussed by such and such
You're a fuckin' loser, man, well, life's a fuckin' uppercut
Right inside my fuckin' gut, wanna fuckin' end it, but
I don't have the balls to, fuck, I'm such a pussy, fuck me up

[Verse 1: Kin$oul]
Everlasting pain, blinds my brain
Smokin' on dank to hide my pain
I ain't gon' lie, shit won't change
Fuck the system, I ain't playing no games
Words like ammunition, click clack position (Click clack)
One shot to your head, information was given (Pew)
Nigga, shut up and listen, I'ma show you a vision
And take your mind on a mission and understand why you livin'
These niggas ass rappers, full-time actors
I can kill a track, even if I rap backwards
Fuck a studio, all a nigga need is a MacBook
And a little bit of drugs and a Backwood
And I'ma start spittin' my pain (My pain)
All of this shit in my brain (My brain)
I don't think nothing's gon' change (It won't change)
But the motherfuckin' money in the bank (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Ooh, yeah, got my minds on some other shit
High as a mothership, surprise, how I'm stuntin', bitch
Polite with the pussy, I say, ""Hi"" when I'm comin' in (""Hi! Hi!"")
Talk all this shit, but the truth, you ain't got it, bitch
Shawty hit me up, I told her I will be there right away
Hide your partner pussy, pop a Xanax, sleep my night away
Wake up, feelin' like this won't be the finest days (Ayy, yeah)
But it gets more better, smokin' the finest haze

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
And it always seem like all the fuckin' voices in my head
Is tryna see me dead before I see my mother wed
And I remember way back when, when I was dead
Broke, I was a fuckin' joke and nobody wanted to fuck with me
Remember sleepin' on my nigga Will bed
Doin' anything just to make sure his nigga fed
And now, I'm recollectin' all the fucking tears I shed
Just to get to where I am and everybody wanna fuck with me
Remember bed bugs? Bed sheets that felt like old rugs
And now, we finally made it out the damn slums
Remember bitches actin' like old nuns
Now they pop that pussy like pornstars if a nigga want some
And that's a damn shame, I'm not ashamed
If you press my nigga Kin, bullets rippin' through your damn brain
And that's for anybody fuckin' with my clique
I feel like Yeezy, 'cause ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique

Bad Vibes Forever
ItWillAllBeOverSoon
[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I see black skies, and white lies, I'd rather be
Dead, filling my head with different enemies
Thoughts consuming me, fueling my insecurities
As the ground right under me crumbles as if it wasn't there
It's too much, my heart's crushed, I'm not alive
I won't allow myself happiness 'cause it's all lies
I've seen the pain, I've run away so many times
Death and I are companions, it's here at all times
I won't love, won't trust, I won't die
I can't feel, but managed to steal your heart, love
Was dirt poor, now fuck whores and want love
It seems that anything offered could be enough, but
As time, body falls
Don't know who to call
Alone, and my heart
Got tat' of it, broke
I'm so fucking numb
My life has succumbed to hatred and death
Alone in the snow

And I'm always where the
Sun don't shine, the tears don't show, won't
Hurt me now 'cause heart's been broke, I
Hate myself, but it won't show, I
Constantly lose all my remorse, and it's
Ten for the wolf and three for the shepherd, and it's
One for the sheep who led by your leopard, often
Gave his perception as a handle of weapon, took a
Bite of your apple, give me all you can offer, now I'm
Trapped in a changing maze, settin' my soul ablaze
Couldn't control the pace, where is this going, hey?
Heartless is recklessness, it's word of a pacifist to
Word of a masochist, I'm off of the map, my Lord, I
Spoke to a Baphomet, he said he would save me if I
Gave him one thing he needed, ""What is this thing?"", I pleaded
Boy, it's the key to even, yeah

[Outro]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
""What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine""

I dream so much
And I just can't seem to find an answer
To what I'm looking for, in general
I can't keep living like this
It's breaking my heart, day by day
I mean, who's to say...
Who's to say you find an answer when living?
What if you just die?
What if life as we know it is all a game?
What if we live for no reason?
What if you just disappear when you die?
Should I cling to life
Or should I just kill myself?
So many contradictions, contemplations
It's getting harder and harder to mask my pain
I can't tell if I wanna live or if I wanna die
Please, save me44Embed"

Bleed red, four doors in the Benz
But I met four ghosts in the pen
And it slipped through my fingertips
And I, could've been
I've lost all hope
DeadBoy, my soul is amiss
Flushed skin, X types of a kiss
Rather hate, bitch
I want nothing to do with this
Just face the abyss, and I (Ayy!)
Place blame for this shit (Ayy)
Rather be dead, dull blades on my wrist, wrist
Fucking with my head, get dead, that's the gist
Flushed, you can see it on me, I'm pissed, pissed
Lost in the mist (Ayy), pants full of piss (Ayy)

Fist fuck, started feeling, silly willy, take a look

Awowowow (Owowowowo!)
Elliott Gould: The irony is that most of the stores that were destroyed during the riots were owned by black people
Edward Furlong: That's stupid though, I mean, why trash your own neighborhood?
Elliott Gould: That's my point it's an irrational act, it's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system
Beverly D'Angelo: Exactly, I mean it's like we had in Watts or the riots in Chicago in '68
Edward Norton: It's crap, I don't buy that for a minute. Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage, that's such a copout, it's opportunism at it's worst, it's a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store, nothing more

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Return of the Hash-Slinging Slasher (Murk)
Couldn't be, wouldn't be, slits in my wrist for you bastards, shameful (Murk)
Blades to his hand for reactions, Catholics (Murk)
Licks I'ma serve, fuck compassion, raped her
Laced with vaxes (Murk), blacks to be casted (Murk)
Rats in the hood always ask for a capture (Murk)
Facebook caption, blast to the magic
Tell a fuck nigga that I hate him with a passion

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts in the shell (Ayy)
Ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts in the shell

[Verse 2: Nyora Spouse]
Got drugs, mothafucka (Woo, woo), laugh like Chris Tucker (Woo, woo)
All these hatin' ass suckas (Woo, woo), never loved by their mothers (Woo, woo)
Nine lives and you pussy
My main bitch married, my side ho loose
Stupid ass niggas think that they shook me
But I got the MAC and I'm bigger than they could be
Stackin' my bread like loafs
She listen to me and that bitch soak
Flexin', stuntin', bitch I gloat
Off that cake and bitch I float
You sensitive fuck, get the fuck out my face
I'm makin' these moves and I come in first place
I'm stackin' my cash, I got my own place
Play with me, straight bust to the face (Ah)

Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking (Cracking)
Foolish of me to think I had it (Of, think I had it)
Emmanuel, how foolish of me (—Lish of me)

I hear your voice behind me (Behind)
Moving up my neck, hear you— hear you talking
Creeping up my shoulder, breath— breathing
In my head, I hear you screaming (Screaming), just do it

Yeah, yeah, oh (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION & SZA]
Don't come close, don't come closeYou don't even know me, you think you know me
Crucifixion, crack rock love, feeding my addiction
Pessimistic, feed her all the lies, and get self-infliction
Blood stains in my gold plates, without a soul, and pure hate
Insecure, ayy, couldn't love another at the same time
Ice cold, see my lover through the grapevine (Ah! Ah!)
History, mystery (Ah), hate her, fuck him
What's meant to me (Uh)? was it pure green?
But this ice can't melt (Fuck!), Ice Hotel

Awowowow (Owowowowo!)
Elliott Gould: The irony is that most of the stores that were destroyed during the riots were owned by black people
Edward Furlong: That's stupid though, I mean, why trash your own neighborhood?
Elliott Gould: That's my point it's an irrational act, it's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system
Beverly D'Angelo: Exactly, I mean it's like we had in Watts or the riots in Chicago in '68
Edward Norton: It's crap, I don't buy that for a minute. Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage, that's such a copout, it's opportunism at it's worst, it's a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store, nothing more

Need a lioness, nose covered in coke (Ayy, ah, ah, ayy)

I thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt when it's sore
Going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION, Anneka]
(I thought you got all you came for)
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my self
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy

[Pre-Drop 1: XXXTENTACION, Anneka]
Oh-ho

And snorting some block detergent, merging for common purpose
They notice that I was soaking in lotion
Running the motion, devotion was not a notion
Hoping that Lexi's open for fucking
Fuck it I’m ducking, and trucking off to New Zealand
I’m wheeling, dealing, cartwheeling
Pop pill and feeling like villain

Alright, I'm comin' up
Any nigga that doubted me, I'm comin' up
Any hctib that looked down on me, I'm comin' up
I stand out, I do my tihs
I've always been on my tihs
I do this for my mom, I do this for my brother, I do this for my fam
Kcuf anybody that says otherwise, case closed, my nigga
Mmh
Eya, ma callin' from the train line
Eya, mmh, eh
So anyways this how the story go
Ow, eh eh
Jah, Jah yutes dem risin'
Risin', risin'
Eh eh
Den gon' dem fallin', fallin', fallin'

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
He showin' signs of corruption
Then went from somethin' to nothin'
He put his hands on his mother
And now he's fuckin' his cousin
Now she's havin' his baby
The bitch is drivin' him crazy
The motherfucker was violent
'Cause he was fresh out the Navy
She dealt with constant abuse
Never revealin' the truth
She kept the feelings concealed
Until they rose to the roof
A war starts, heart drop, 'cause she was tied to the bed
Just as she thought it was over, he put a gun to her head
But listen

All my life, I dreamed these things
Seems surreal that I see these things
Until I D-I-E, all you niggas just P-I-E
Nah, nigga can't sleep on me, ah, ah
But listen
All my life, I dreamed these things
Seems surreal that I see these things
Until I D-I-E, all you niggas just P-I-E
Nah, nigga can't sleep on me

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Sleep with a knife by your bed
So convinced she got a gun to her head
Only relief is when she's takin' the meds
Or takin' Henny instead
Takin' liquor to her belly in bed
Until her belly is red
Now she's findin' out the baby is dead
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she got no cure
And she want more
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she got no cure
And she want more
[Bridge: ?]
Eh eh
Jah, Jah yutes dem risin'
Risin', risin'
Eh eh
Den gon' dem fallin', fallin', fallin'

[Verse 3: XXXTENTACION]
About a quarter to noon
He started roamin' these streets
Left her tied back home
Her mouth was covered with sheets
He started makin' observations from startin' up conversations
Pill pop, left himself with no options
'Cause his mind is made and he keeps countin' his days
Rather than smokin', the nigga simply goin' insane
Tyin' himself to a bridge as it began to occur
Fucker couldn't breathe, his sight had even went to a blur
Guess it's the drugs that made the nigga absurd
Thin-thin-thinkin' 'bout the past and all the things that he learned
But then it came to a turn
Started thinkin' evil thoughts in the burn
Ran for years and now the thought has retur—

[Part II: Flock]
[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Pussy popper, Young Waka Flocka
We shakin' like maracas, don't forget Sinatra
My bitch is like Rihanna, betty yet Beyoncé
Had to take her top off, gun shots'a pop off
Mi nuh fuck 'round with dem bwoy dem, dem, bwoy dem get chop off
Tell di bwoy fi gwaan fi him, gyal and suck him bloodclaat
Dick stains let my dick hang like a nunchuk
Anyway, I can't, bitch, I'm just tryna get my nut sucked
Hah, so fuck luck, bitch, it's pure skill when I gun bust
Glocks like .50 on my niggas, acupuncture
Fuck like, it's a shit night, get your mind right
Only way a nigga coolin' if I get high, right?
High up in the sky, right?
Motherfucka' cloud all my niggas in the ground right now
And I bash like Zao, like Pow
Mind within the comic, I'm so high right now
So pass that
Skinny motherfucker, won’t you tell me where the cash at?
I’m about to end a nigga life so where the stash at?
Got about twenty fuckin' mill', just chillin' in my backpack
Call a fat bitch then I hit it in her ass crack

Rap so sinister, murder your local minister (Y'all feel like that?)

Heard you straight as a cylinder, so I can't fucks wit' you
All my niggas is gang bangers and ditch diggers
Heard we was bumpin', so you had to bring your clique with ya'
So you know I had to put a bullet in 'bout six niggas (Yeah)
Fuck niggas, they running their triathlon
Catch me gettin' sloppy wit' a bitch that look like Asher Roth (Yeah)
And I ain't playin' games like zombies, bitch, I'm getting trains
Runnin' trains and bitches killing snitches in an aeroplane
And I'm a menace, see more mouths than a dentist
I'm killing till I'm replenished, you niggas don't know the half of it
Half-ass rappers talking shit, check the time
Turn around and see my nigga's wit' me totin' .49's
And know they mad 'cause I ain't really stuntin' shit
I hate the bitch and have my other wife who playing wit' my dick (Y'all feel like that?)
Swallow spitting, she swallow spitting, she swallow spitting

Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling (Dutty, young blood sucka')
Buried under deeper ground (Uh)
Yeah, okay, uh, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
I seem depressed, always being bothered, never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a check
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast, huh

Okay, okay

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
If death is what it seems
Why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor
Mind's full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate
Your conversates, hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions, then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then 'cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acuras
Accurate facts put the black, in fact, if you thought that
You are free, you should disregard that, all facts

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Pick litter, the middle of six niggers
Is bitter as dick lickers as licking the clits, clitoris
Vigorous black bags like the vividus black Casper
Who's back in the past faster than Beverly, mean cash or with Cassidy
And the passenger packin' the shovel, rackin' up bodies
Quicker than calories, salaries, mean spend it and vend it
A pussy magnet and stagnant and fra-, fragments of faggots
Whose clique clackin' with cactuses and the package delivered
For fuckin' sending 'em cinnamon covered synonyms
Get' 'em, got 'em, killin’ 'em, killable fuckin' liberal, kiddable
Little fucker, then suck a cunt in a couple of
Chemotherapy offices, officer of accomplishing condiments
Any converse is commonly incompetent prominence
Get a communist, but-
They never understand how it feels to be a man
How it feels to be a man, hm

[Verse 2: MUUUDY BOOTS]
Rolling blunts to the guys inside of Liverpool
We wearing a couple pound of weed and a pound of shrooms
Psy-, psy-, psychedelic, man, now if you turn on Times
I read my storyline, never did indulge a crime

They say I couldn't rap, came back like receipts
You can meet me at the Lick or you can meet me at the crib
We can fuck up in the car or we can fuck up in the sheets
Any once I meet you in that pussy like a meet-and-greet
Livin' out my life courses
Take your bitch to eat, dining with five horses
Everything five stars, white bitches off bars

Sleep with a knife by your bed, so convinced, she got a gun to her head
Only relief is when she’s taking the meds or taking Henny instead
Taking liquor to her belly in bed until her belly is red
Now she's findin' out the baby is dead
She don't wanna live this life no more, but she's stuck because she got no cure and she want more

About a quarter to noon, he started roaming these streets
Left her tied back home, her mouth was covered with sheets
He started making observations from starting up conversations
Pill pop, left himself with no options
'Cause his mind is made and he keeps counting his days
Rather than smoking, the nigga simply going insane
Tying himself to a bridge as it began to occur
Fucker couldn't breathe, his sight had even went to a blur
Guess it's the drugs that made the nigga absurd
Thin-thin-thinking 'bout the past and all the things that he learned, but then it came to a turn
Started thinking evil thoughts in the burn
Ran for years and now the thought has returned2Embed"

Alright, I'm comin' up

He showin' signs of corruption
Then went from somethin' to nothin'
He put his hands on his mother
And now he's fuckin' his cousin
Now she's havin' his baby
The bitch is drivin' him crazy
The motherfucker was violent
'Cause he was fresh out the Navy
She dealt with constant abuse
Never revealin' the truth
She kept the feelings concealed
Until they rose to the roof
A war starts, heart drop, 'cause she was tied to the bed
Just as she thought it was over, he put a gun to her head

And we will talk about that very much so in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville. So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular, I want to thank—

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you, I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you, my heart has gone as still as a corpse
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you, I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you, my heart has gone as still as a corpse

[Verse: XXXTENTACION & Donald Trump]
Why the fuck should I apologize? Country's orderless, it's a lie
By these fuckin' government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future, it's right in my hands
And the future of many youth, if I play my cards can advance, and-
Genuine dime, I opened my mind, and where can I find this future?
Sever your mind or you will be blind, and trapped in a mind of lies within our walls
I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides) The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

This has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.  What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.  No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society.  And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play.​77Embed"

Love is not kisses, hugs, sharing fucking drugs
Pictures on your birthday, pictures of making love
It’s dedication, trust and patience and compromise
Now do or die, ultimatums for you and I
I feel the vibe between us fading and I fucking hate it
I cut myself constantly, I hate myself for creating
Pain within your heart and I’m thinking
This pistol's tempting to scream it out
To my demons get even within yourself
She’s crying, she needs your help
And you’re selfish, think ‘bout yourself
All these problems created
Extended from hate with self
And I hope that you wouldn’t leave
But the patience that you would need
Is the patience of several gods
Hanging on to my selfish pleads
And I’m sorry, you deserve better
I wanted more for you, you hanging on
You being strong and I want more for you
As long as you won’t leave me in the end
We both can still pretend
That this life we live in is worth it, I promiseYou might also like10Embed"

Yeah

[Verse 1]
There she was with the blade in her hand
Scars on her skin replaced kiss of the man
She's played a part for as long as she's known
Regret fills her heart as her love leaves her home
She's learned to be passive, but such is a loss
Accepting defeat when I foreclose the cost
For her, this was needed to be rid of the pain
You play the victim and I'll play insane

[Chorus]
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
A shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots to her body 'til she is a stump

[Verse 2]
Stomp out the fucker, his death will be slow
You made me do this just as far as you know
If you don't exist then my pain can be rid
So I gut the fucker then eat like a pig

[Chorus]
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
A shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots to her body 'til she is a stump
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
A shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots to her body 'til she is a stump

I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should've set it free but I
Our Father, hallowed be thy Name
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
Thy Kingdom come
I should've set it free but I

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Hush little angel, don't say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won't snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go
I was too disloyal 'cause I won't understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
Water flies off and the lake don't stream
Wrist down the river, not across, wanna bleed

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Wake up to your face
I'm straight-forward, fuck a pace
Want what I want, it just so happened to be you
Couldn't picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise, I failed
I won't deny it, I hailed the ground you walk on, yeah
Heart stops, you walk away
You're good today, you're gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I'm so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it's here, hand on my chest

You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

Yeah

[Verse]
Star fall, fear calls waitin' on you, I'd never run
Kiss, fuck, I won't feel I doubt that I would ever want
Hold me, kiss me, fuck me, you don't wanna love
Haunt me, hang me, love me, I don't ever love

[Chorus]
Ooh, there's an elephant in this room

Alright, I found this sound in Stockholm
The comfortin' I feel with it
It's a form of hypnotism
Do you feel it?

[Verse]
So if I escape, will my pain go away?
This thing should be needless to say
I walk in my mind and I wonder
But till death the inferno, I plunder
Action misleading the spared
There is a home, but with nobody there
In debt with the darkness for years and the centuries
A body is hidden, so you ought to envy
Your actions are covered in sin
But you've never felt so alive
If you think that you're leaving your room
Then you've not a choice but to die

[Chorus]
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep (Now, ayy)
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep (Ayy, ayy)
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep
There is no escape (Envy this)
There is no escape, there is no escape
