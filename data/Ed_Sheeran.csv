One touch, electric shock
Eyes locked, like, did you feel that too?
World stops, just us
Here under dots in the darkness
Of the blue, out of the blue

[Chorus]
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical

Our lips barely one inch
Your skin brushed by my fingertips
Mornings, white mist
So delicate, covers as we begin
As we begin

It is opening day and a brand new start
The stones have been cleared around the fisherman's hut
And the air bites, then leaves almost invisible cuts on the skin
A lighthouse retired, but a new one was hired
About twenty foot taller, painted in black and white
Twenty million steps with a computer inside instead of him

[Chorus]
Only one road sign tellin' cars to slow down
And a long drop in the ocean
Beware of the riptide, broken glass and train lines
It's a new day and this is England

[Verse 2]
Next to the pub with the flag that's workin' flexible hours
'Cause there's a mismatch of carriages, soil in a boat for some flowers
Fairy lights on a building that's supplyin' us power from the sea
Electricity lines flow like veins to the town
In between, there is nothin' but grass and pebbles on the ground
Do not enter the wild here if you want to be found for the free

[Chorus]
View the flame of sunrise cut in half by the sky
And the empty of the desert
Team of birds that swerve by and then land on the wires
It's a new day and this is England

When it's time to escape from the heavy of this
There is nothin' like washin' away
I find this country of mine gets a bad reputation
Of bein' cold and grey
But on the coast of the south to the east followed 'round
I find serenity I've never felt
There's a peace and a quiet in this island of ours
That can't be mirrored by anywhere else

[Verse 3]
Homes protruding from stones with their wood coloured black
Scattered cars in the line, steam risin' out the shack
One door at the front and then just glass out the back for the view

[Chorus]
And the blue is so bright, you'll need shades for your eyes
And a cable to pull over
Take a walk and feel like everything will be fine
It's a new day and this is England1Embed"

I caught a sickness and they don't know the name of it
I flew to Paris tryin' to get away, mm
I drown my sadness, embarrassed by the shame of it
But all it seems to do is magnify the pain

I wish I was a strong boy, head in the sand
If I were them, I would be the man
And my lips are searchin' for what happiness is
I'm draggin' my feet, tryin' to breathe again

Yeah, I'm tryna feel amazin'
Yeah, but I can't get out of my way and
Yeah, wish I could feel amazin'
But this is all that I can feel today

[Verse 2]
I tore the page and I put all of my weight on it
So I could stop it, tryin' to blow away, mm
The darkest days, well, I got all I could take from them
Startin' to think it'll never change

[Pre-Chorus]
I see my life is planned in front of me
And I don't need to do a thing just because I can
And my friends are talkin' like, ""What's happened to him?""

I overthink and have trouble sleepin'
All purpose gone and don't have a reason
And there's no doctor to stop this bleedin'
So I left home and jumped in the deep end
Took a job for dad, I think, just to please him
So, when I quit, I just kept it secret
And I had friends, but no longer see them
And it's just me and, now, all my demons

[Pre-Chorus]
Are heavy, weighin' on my heart
I guess I'm done already, all but given up
I'm burnin' days till the weekends
And starts, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?

[Chorus]
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rеly on the strobe lights
The lifеline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag

[Verse 2]
My friend died, it's been years, still grievin'
And I thought time would be somehow healin'
When love finds me, I'm too numb to feel it
Oh, why the fuck am I still here breathin'?
Well, I would pray, but I don't believe it
Oh, woe is me, but I don't care either
Life is not the way that it seems, but
Maybe this will all be a dream

We're a long way from home
Haven't seen you in so long
But it all came back in one moment
And the year started cold
But I didn't notice at all
When we found there's a room we're both in

[Pre-Chorus]
We get Chinese food in small white boxes
Live the life we saw in Friends
Your room, it barely fits the mattress
Wake up, leave for work again
The wind, it seems to blow right through us
Down jackets are the trend
The rush of rushing deep into love

[Chorus]
English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
My English girl in an American town

The days come and go
But it ends when doors close
And the scent of your perfume's on me
You're useless with your phone
Electric when one-on-one
I thought I would be more nervous, darlin'

[Pre-Chorus]
We watch comedies and miss the endings
Conversations till the dawn
Any change in tide, we push against it
Challenge meanings in the songs
And head out without a reservation
Drinkin' out of paper bags
And wasting time is time not wasted

[Chorus]
With my English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
My English girl in an American town
[Bridge]
And when our eyes are closed together, I can't explain
How the scent of your perfume takes me to a higher place
We can watch it unfold or we can change how it takes
And rebuild when it breaks down

[Pre-Chorus]
We drink Moscow Mules and steal the cups
From, mostly, the Bowery Bar
What a perfect day to fall in love on
What a way to make it start
It appears, when you think all is lost
Then, you don't remember when it started
Never have to pretend

[Chorus]
With my English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down

Is this just gettin' older?
I can't get away from this rain
I'm startin' to think that it's me
And I wanna just create things
But the longer it takes, I feel drained
Can't remember a day I've been sober
Not in a place to take blame
Any more weight, I might break
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Guess we all go the same way
I'm in a bit of a mess here
I count to ten and I hope to disappear
I never did my homework
Could I have been more than this?
Findin' a way to exist
Within a world with no risk
Forcin' a shoe that won't fit
I spend most the days stoned
And makin' excuses for it
Sayin', ""It helped to write this""
But on the real, I'm tight-lipped
Shootin' the shot that I'll miss

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's so far from near
Why the hell am I still here?

This is not the end of our lives
This is just a bump in the ride
And I know that it will be alright
And if it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?

Maybe I'll never find my smile
But who's to blame? Well, that's on me

[Verse 2]
Now that the weather is colder
Nothin' is maskin' this pain
The summer was here, but won't stay
And we are inside, like, all day
Regrettin' the things that we say
And it takes a toll, yeah
The conversation won't end
Bein' a rock for your friends
Cracks in the surface don't mend
We only break, we don't bend
And you'd think it was so clear
But I can't see nothin' but the fear
I'm feelin' so bloated
Thinkin' a salad won't do
Might as well open up two
Lockin' myself in my room
Hopin' that this'll end soon
And no one will notice
What I will put myself through
'Cause they will hate themselves too
Isn't it mad what we do?
Pretendin' to win, but just lose
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's so far from near
Why the hell am I still here?

[Bridge]
Too many things on my mind
To process moments of life
There's some days I lose my drive
Then, some, can't control the fire
I'm aware that things take time
But I'm not a patient guy
Maybe, if I wait, I'll find
Resemblance of peace of mind
[Verse 3]
This is just gettin' older
Runnin' away from our past
Knowin', the calm, it won't last
Bein' a mouse in this grass
Feelin' the snakes behind us
And I'm searchin' for closure
But nothin' is healin' these scars
When I open up, they just laugh
Sayin' if they had just half
Then nothin' would ever be dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it, ""New me, new year""
Or just the same old blue sphere?

[Chorus]
This is not the end of our lives
This is just a bump in the ride
And I know that it will be alright
And, if it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?
I can't help myself but cry every time that I realise
Maybe I'll never find my smile
But who's to blame? Well, that's on me

I'm a half-read story, I was fine on the shelf
Why did you take me down as if I needed your help?
No prior warnin', no one to catch when I fell
Now that you're not around, I'm not doin' so well

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I look like a monster underneath all my skin?
I wanna cut all this open till I'm feelin' somethin'
Now I'm chasin' the cracks, so I can let the light in
I'm in love with the ghost of ya

[Chorus]
Better luck next year, there's nothin' left here
Why am I constantly searchin', feelin' unsettled?
Livin' in Hell, pretendin' it's Heaven
Head spin, maybе I'm destined to be
Always lonеly, alone, a loser, pathetic
Maybe tomorrow will be better

Now I feel like the fool, haunted by desire
For a moment of glory, I would risk all I am

Well, good morning there
What a way to start the day
With everything laid bare
Hair on the pillow like a frame

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could capture every fleck of light
I'd capture all and everythin'
I'd wager that nobody's ever felt the way we feel
When I asked you to be all of life
I knew for every second of our ups and downs
They'd turn around like grass upon the wheel
Like grass upon the wheel

[Chorus]
Well, I get lost inside my head
In this chaos, you're my calm
And I will find my feet again
'Cause еven the worst days of my life will always еnd

At midnight in your arms

I have moments when I doubt myself
But feeling low should still be felt
It's natural to be consumed with unrelentin' fear

I worry till there's nothin' left
But, in this darkness, you're my sun
And I will find my feet again

Where is my mind? I've lost the nerve
This year flew by without a word
I had a plan to cross the world
But haven't left this island
The stores closed down and opened up
I said I'd do a sober month
I failed, but tried and wrote this drunk
In overwhelming silence

[Chorus]
And I'll see my friends when all this ends
But now until then, I'm holdin' out for spring
We can't let winter win
That's why I'm holdin' out for spring
Oh, what a state we're in
I'll keep holdin' out for spring

[Verse 2]
Homework and cancelled holidays
The blame gets passed to save a face
The smell of last night's takeaway
Just tells me I'm a mess
Still watchin' shows they recommend
That don't get good until the end
I could be unwell, but then again
Maybe I'm just depressed

Got a call from my mother who wishes she was here
Couple of cards in the post that I'm readin'
I want the warmth of the summer, the cold too cold to bear
The only plus is the sweater, I need it
I broke apart from my lover a couple months ago
If they were here, then I guess I wouldn't be alone
This is the life in the city and that's the way it goes
But it's a fine excuse just to leave it

[Pre-Chorus]
I hit 'em up and I asked, ""Are you comin' ovеr?""
And all I got was a shrug and an ""I don't know""

[Chorus]
And everyone I know is hiddеn away
Tryin' to make their bodies clean again
And they don't want to celebrate
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Always the month when parties come to an end
The same excuses from every friend
Another year and now we're here again
Nobody cares this is the day I was born

Every day that we're here, well, we're never gettin' back
And so I'll drink for the confidence 'cause that's what I lack
And end up talkin' to strangers and find another plan
I end the night in the cab, head spinnin', on my own
Watchin' pointless shit and flickin' through my phone
And would April be better? I guess I'll never know
I take the keys from my pocket and stumble into home

About twenty foot taller, painted in black and white
Twenty million steps with a computer inside instead of him

[Chorus]
Only one road sign telling cars to slow down
And a long drop in the ocean
Beware of the riptide, broken glass and train lines
It's a new day, and this is England

[Verse 2]
Next to the pub with the flag that's workin' flexible hours
There's a mismatch of carriages, soil in a boat for some flowers
Fairy lights on a building that's supplyin' us power from the sea
Electricity lines flow like veins through the town
In between, there is nothing but grass and pebbles on the ground
Do not enter the wild here if you want to be found for the free

[Chorus]
View the flame of sunrise cut in half by the sky
And the empty of the desert
Team of birds that swerve by and then land on the wires
It's a new day, and this is England

When it's time to escape all the heavy of this
There is nothing like washin' away
I find this country of mine gets a bad reputation
Of bein' cold and grey
From the coast of the south, the east followed 'round
I find serenity I've never felt
There's a peace and a quiet in this island of ours
That can't be mirrored by anywhere else

[Verse 3]
Homes protruding from stones with their wood coloured black
Scattered cars in a line, steam rising out the shack
One door at the front and then just glass out the back for the view

[Chorus]
And the blue is so bright, you'll need shades for your eyes
And a cable to pull over
Take a walk and feel like everything will be fine
It's a new day, and this is EnglandEmbed"

I caught a sickness and they don't know the name of it
I flew to Paris tryin' to get away, mm
I drown my sadness, embarrassed by the shame of it
But all it seems to do is magnify the pain

If I were them, I would be the man
And my lips are searchin' for what happiness is
I'm draggin' my feet, tryin' to breathe again

Yeah, but I can't get out of my way and

But this is all that I can feel today

So I could stop it, tryin' to blow away, mm
The darkest days, well, I got all I could take from them
Startin' to think it'll never change

I overthink and have trouble sleepin'
All purpose gone and don't have a reason
And there's no doctor to stop this bleedin'
So I left home and jumped in the deep end
Took a job for dad, I think, just to please him
So, when I quit, I just kept it secret
And I had friends, but no longer see them
It's just me and, now, all my demons

[Pre-Chorus]
Are heavy, weighin' on my heart
I guess I'm done already, all but given up
I'm burnin' days till the weekends
And starts, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?

[Chorus]
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rеly on the strobe lights
The lifеline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag

[Verse 2]
My friend died, it's been years, still grievin'
And I thought time would be somehow healin'
When love finds me, I'm too numb to feel it
Oh, why the fuck am I still here breathin'?
Well, I would pray, but I don't believe it
Woe is me, but I don't care either
Life is not the way that it seems, but
Maybe this will all be a dream

We're a long way from home
Haven't seen you in so long
But it all came back in one moment
And the year started cold
But I didn't notice at all
When we found there's a room we're both in

[Pre-Chorus]
We eat Chinese food in small white boxes
Live the life we saw in Friends
Your room, it barely fits the mattress
Wake up, leave for work again
The wind, it seems to blow right through us
Down jackets are the trend
The rush of rushing deep into love

[Chorus]
English girl in an American town
No еlevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzеr, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me

And it end when doors close
And the scent of your perfume's on me
You're useless with your phone
Electric when one-on-one
I thought I would be more nervous, darlin'

We watch comedies and miss the endings
Conversations till the dawn
Any change in tide, we push against it
Challenge meanings in the songs
And head out without a reservation
Drinkin' out of paper bags
And wasting time is time not wasted

And when our eyes are closed together, I can't explain
How the scent of your perfume takes me to a higher place
We can watch it unfold or we can change how it takes
And rebuild when it breaks down

We drink Moscow Mules and steal the cups
From, mostly, the Bowery Bar
What a perfect way to fall in love on
What a way to make it start
It appears, when you think all is lost
Then, you don't remember when it happened
Never have to pretend

Is this just gettin' older?
I can't get away from this rain
I'm startin' to think that it's me
And I wanna just create things
But the longer it takes, I feel drained
Can't remember a day I've been sober
Not in a place to take blame
Any more weight, I might break
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Guess we all go the same way
I'm in a bit of a mess here
I count to ten and I hope to disappear
I never I did my homework
Could I have been more than this?
Findin' a way to exist
Within a world with no risk
Forcin' a shoe that won't fit
I spеnd most the days stoned
And makin' excusеs for it
Sayin', ""It helped to write this""
But on the real, I'm tight-lipped
Shootin' the shot that I'll miss

Regrettin' the things that we say
And it takes a toll, yeah

Bein' a rock for your friends

We only break, we don't bend
And you'd think it was so clear
But I can't see nothin' but the fear
I'm feelin' so bloated
Thinkin' a salad won't do
Might as well open up two
Lockin' myself in my room
Hopin' that this'll end soon
And no one will notice
What I will put myself through

To process moments of life
There's some days I lose my drive
Then, some, can't control the fire

But I'm not a patient guy
Maybe, if I wait, I'll find
Resemblance of peace of mind
[Verse 3]
This is just gettin' older
Runnin' away from our past
Knowin', the calm, it won't last
Bein' a mouse in this grass
Feelin' the snakes behind us
I'm searchin' for closure
But nothin' is healin' these scars
When I open up, they just laugh
Sayin' if they had just half
Then nothin' would ever be dark

Or just the same old blue sphere?

I'd capture all and anythin'
I'd wager that nobody's ever felt the way we feel
When I asked you to be all of life
I knew for every second of our ups and downs
They'd turn around like grass upon the wheel
Like grass upon the wheel

Well, I get lost inside my head
In this chaos, you're my calm
And I will find my feet again
'Cause even the worst days of my life will always end

Sorry I missed your call
It was silent for the song
Let me know when you're free to talk
I won't miss it for the world, no, I won't

Than just a hint of when you smile
I could go blind and I'd still know your scent
Whenever you'd appear
I'd have moments when I doubt myself
But feeling low should still be felt
It's natural to be consumed with unrelentin' fear
With unrelentin' fear

[Chorus]
I worry till there's nothin' left
But, in this darkness, you're my sun
And I will find my feet again
'Cause even the worst days of my life will always end

Where is my mind? I've lost the nerve
This year flew by without a word
I had a plan to cross the world
But haven't left this island
The stores closed down and opened up
I said I'd do a sober month
I failed, but tried and wrote this drunk
In overwhelming silence

[Chorus]
And I'll see my friends when all this ends
But now until then, I'm holdin' out for spring
We can't let winter win
That's why I'm holdin' out for spring
Oh, what a state we're in
I'll keep holdin' out for spring

Homework and cancelled holidays
The blame gets passed to save a facе
The smell of last night's takeaway
Just tеlls me I'm a mess
Still watchin' shows they recommend
That don't get good until the end
I could be unwell, but then again
Maybe I'm just depressed

Got a call from my mother who wishes she was here
Couple of cards in the post that I'm readin'
I want the warmth of the summer, the cold too cold to bear
The only plus is the sweater, I need it
I broke apart from my lover a couple months ago
If they were here, then I guess I wouldn't be alone
This is the life in the city and that's the way it goes
But it's a fine excuse just to leave it

[Pre-Chorus]
I hit 'em up and I asked, ""Are you comin' over?""
And all I got was a shrug and an ""I don't know""

[Chorus]
And everyone I know is hidden away
Tryin' to make their bodies clean again
They don't want to celebrate
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Always the month when parties come to an end
The same excuses from every friend
Another year and now we're here again
Nobody cares this is the day I was born

I end the night in the cab, head spinnin', on my own
Watchin' pointless shit and flickin' through my phone
And would April be better? I guess I'll never know

Shed the skin that guards the man
Sheltered by the ceiling

It is opening day and a brand new start
The stones have been cleared around the fisherman's hut
And the air bites, then leaves almost invisible cuts on the skin
A lighthouse retired, but a new one was hired
About twenty foot taller, painted in black and white
Twenty million steps with a computer inside instead of him

[Chorus]
Only one road sign tellin' cars to slow down
And a long drop in the ocean
Beware of the riptide, broken glass and train lines
It's a new day and this is England

[Verse 2]
Next to the pub with the flag that's workin' flexible hours
'Cause there's a mismatch of carriages, soil in a boat for some flowers
Fairy lights on a building that's supplyin' us power from the sea
Electricity lines flow like veins to the town
In between, there is nothin' but grass and pebbles on the ground
Do not enter the wild here if you want to be found for the free

[Chorus]
View the flame of sunrise cut in half by the sky
And the empty of the desert
Team of birds that swerve by and then land on the wires

When it's time to escape from the heavy of this
There is nothin' like washin' away
I find this country of mine gets a bad reputation
Of bein' cold and grey
But on the coast of the south to the east followed 'round
I find serenity I've never felt
There's a peace and a quiet in this island of ours
That can't be mirrored by anywhere else

[Verse 3]
Homes protruding from stones with their wood coloured black
Scattered cars in the line, steam risin' out the shack
One door at the front and then just glass out the back for the view

And the blue is so bright, you'll need shades for your eyes
And a cable to pull over
Take a walk and feel like everything will be fine

I overthink and have trouble sleepin'
All purpose gone and don't have a reason
And there's no doctor to stop this bleedin'
So I left home and jumped in the deep end
Took a job for dad, I think, just to please him
So, when I quit, I just kept it secret
And I had friends, but no longer see them
And it's just me and, now, all my demons

[Pre-Chorus]
Are heavy, weighin' on my heart
I guess I'm done already, all but given up
I'm burnin' days till the weekends
And starts, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?

[Chorus]
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rеly on the strobe lights
The lifеline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag

[Verse 2]
My friend died, it's been years, still grievin'
And I thought time would be somehow healin'
When love finds me, I'm too numb to feel it
Oh, why the fuck am I still here breathin'?
Well, I would pray, but I don't believe it
Oh, woe is me, but I don't care either
Life is not the way that it seems, but
Maybe this will all be a dream

And I'll stay steady, balance on the rope
I guess that I'm not ready to rely on the hope
I'm burnin' days till the weekends
And starts, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?

Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights

I'm a wreck-head, ah
Take me to the other side
Don't look in my eyes, oh, woah

[Verse 3]
It's almost mornin', I'm still not leavin'
It's wearin' off, but I still can feel it
Another one and I'll touch the ceilin'
This is all I want to be

We're a long way from home
Haven't seen you in so long
But it all came back in one moment
And the year started cold
But I didn't notice at all
When we found there's a room we're both in

[Pre-Chorus]
We get Chinese food in small white boxes
Live the life we saw in Friends
Your room, it barely fits the mattress
Wake up, leave for work again
The wind, it seems to blow right through us
Down jackets are the trend
The rush of rushing deep into love

[Chorus]
English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
My English girl in an American town
In an American town

The days come and go
But it ends when doors close
And the scent of your perfume's on me
You're useless with your phone
Electric when one-on-one
I thought I would be more nervous, darlin'

[Pre-Chorus]
We watch comedies and miss the endings
Conversations till the dawn
Any change in tide, we push against it
Challenge meanings in the songs
And head out without a reservation
Drinkin' out of paper bags
And wasting time is time not wasted

[Chorus]
With my English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
My English girl in an American town
[Bridge]
And when our eyes are closed together, I can't explain
How the scent of your perfume takes me to a higher place
We can watch it unfold or we can change how it takes
And rebuild when it breaks down

[Pre-Chorus]
We drink Moscow Mules and steal the cups
From, mostly, the Bowery Bar
What a perfect day to fall in love on
What a way to make it start
It appears, when you think all is lost
Then, you don't remember when it started
Never have to pretend

[Chorus]
With my English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down

Is this just gettin' older?
I can't get away from this rain
I'm startin' to think that it's me
And I wanna just create things
But the longer it takes, I feel drained
Can't remember a day I've been sober
Not in a place to take blame
Any more weight, I might break
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Guess we all go the same way
I'm in a bit of a mess here
I count to ten and I hope to disappear
I never did my homework
Could I have been more than this?
Findin' a way to exist
Within a world with no risk
Forcin' a shoe that won't fit
I spend most the days stoned
And makin' excuses for it
Sayin', ""It helped to write this""
But on the real, I'm tight-lipped
Shootin' the shot that I'll miss

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's so far from near
Why the hell am I still here?

This is not the end of our lives
This is just a bump in the ride
And I know that it will be alright
And if it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?
I can't help myself but cry every time that I realise
Maybe I'll never find my smile
But who's to blame? Well, that's on me

[Post-Chorus]
Well, that's on me, well, that's on me

[Verse 2]
Now that the weather is colder
Nothin' is maskin' this pain
The summer was here, but won't stay
And we are inside, like, all day
Regrettin' the things that we say
And it takes a toll, yeah
The conversation won't end
Bein' a rock for your friends
Cracks in the surface don't mend
We only break, we don't bend
And you'd think it was so clear
But I can't see nothin' but the fear
I'm feelin' so bloated
Thinkin' a salad won't do
Might as well open up two
Lockin' myself in my room
Hopin' that this'll end soon
And no one will notice
What I will put myself through
'Cause they will hate themselves too
Isn't it mad what we do?
Pretendin' to win, but just lose
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's so far from near
Why the hell am I still here?

[Chorus]
This is not the end of our lives
This is just a bump in the ride
And I know that it will be alright
And if it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?

Maybe I'll never find my smile
But who's to blame? Well, that's on me

[Post-Chorus]
Well, that's on me, well, that's on me

[Bridge]
Too many things on my mind
To process moments of life
There's some days I lose my drive
Then, some, can't control the fire
I'm aware that things take time
But I'm not a patient guy
Maybe, if I wait, I'll find
Resemblance of peace of mind
[Verse 3]
This is just gettin' older
Runnin' away from our past
Knowin', the calm, it won't last
Bein' a mouse in this grass
Feelin' the snakes behind us
And I'm searchin' for closure
But nothin' is healin' these scars
When I open up, they just laugh
Sayin' if they had just half
Then nothin' would ever be dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it, ""New me, new year""
Or just the same old blue sphere?

[Chorus]
This is not the end of our lives
This is just a bump in the ride
And I know that it will be alright
And, if it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?
I can't help myself but cry every time that I realise
Maybe I'll never find my smile

The stores closed down and opened up

I failed, but tried and wrote this drunk
In overwhelming silence

But now until then, I'm holdin' out for spring

The blame gets passed to save a face

Just tells me I'm a mess

All I am is only flesh and bone
Why's your heart so freezin' cold?
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (Hey)
I can't help it, but I love you so
I can't take this lettin' go
I still feel that we could work it out or somethin'
All I am is only flesh and bone
Why's your heart so freezin' cold?
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (No, I can't help it, no)
I can't help it, but I love you so (No, I can't help it, no)
I can't take this lettin' go (I will never let you go)
I still feel that we could work it out or somethin' (I will never let you go; No, I can't help it, no)

But God knows I'm tryin'
I need to redefine

Constantly fightin'

But when will I be alright?

Got a call from my mother who wishes she was here
Couple of cards in the post that I'm readin'
I want the warmth of the summer, the cold too cold to bear
The only plus is the sweater, I need it
I broke apart from my lover a couple months ago
If they were here, then I guess I wouldn't be alone
This is the life in the city and that's the way it goes
But it's a fine excuse just to leave it

[Pre-Chorus]
I hit 'em up and I asked, ""Are you comin' ovеr?""
And all I got was a shrug and an ""I don't know""

[Chorus]
And everyone I know is hiddеn away
Tryin' to make their bodies clean again
And they don't want to celebrate
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Always the month when parties come to an end
The same excuses from every friend
Another year and now we're here again
Nobody cares this is the day I was born

[Post-Chorus]
Another birthday alone
La-la-lay, la-la-lay

I hit a bar in town, get my card to start a tab
Every day that we're here, well, we're never gettin' back
And so I'll drink for the confidence 'cause that's what I lack
And end up talkin' to strangers and find another plan
I end the night in the cab, head spinnin', on my own
Watchin' pointless shit and flickin' through my phone
And would April be better? I guess I'll never know
I take the keys from my pocket and stumble into home

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel low, but I guess I could feel lower
I'm headin' down and now I'm on a roll

And everyone I know is hidden away
Tryin' to make their bodies clean again

Thank you very much, how you guys doing?
Welcome to Subtract
So um, the origins of this album
I know I've written about it on, online but like
When I finished Plus, my debut album, the next album I was gonna make was Subtract
And I went in, uh, with Rick Rubin
And we started recording this acoustic album
And it just sort of morphed into Multiply
Because I don't think I was probably ready to make an acoustic album
I wanted to, you know, make, sing with Pharrell and ""Thinking Out Loud"" and ""Photograph"" and do, and do all this sort of stuff and then
After that came Divide and
After Divide I really wanted to make Subtract
But it also morphed into Equals in the pandemic
And I wanted to come out of the pandemic with ""Bad Habits"" and havе a song that's made people dancе and stuff
So I'd been putting this record together over a decade with all my favorite acoustic songs that I'd written over the last decade
And it was uh, slated to be put out this year
Uh, and then at the beginning of last year I had, I probably had the darkest month of my life
And it made me address lots of things and
I'd met Aaron previously
Everyone make some noise for mister Aaron Dessner, right over there
And I'd met Aaron through Taylor
Taylor had hooked me and Aaron up through email
And then me and Aaron went to dinner
This is like November 2021
Me and Aaron went for dinner and uh
I was telling him I'm just about to put out this album Subtract
But after that I would love to try something different maybe with electric guitars, blah, blah, blah
And he sent me a bunch of instrumentals
And I sort of had them for awhile
And I was like, I will, I'll get to them eventually but you know
I'm gonna put out Subtract and do all of that
And then February happened
And I basically wrote over all these instrumentals
We got in the studio and we, and we finished it
And uh, what has come out of it is actually what Subtract was always meant to be which is, which is this record
Uh, so I'm gonna play it in full, all the songs and explain stories behind them
This song is called ""Salt Water""
It's basically like, I've had, you know, ups and downs throughout my life since I was very very young
And uh, you know, as I've got older and become a parent
Those ups and downs, you feel more ashamed about because, you know you
You hate thinking dark dark thoughts when you have children to look after
But this is uh, a song which basically encapsulates all of that ""what if""
And it's called ""Salt Water""

There's still so far to go and I can't feel my toes
When the rain soaks through the heels and slips to the sole
Well, the blades are two feet tall
I wade in green, I'm movin' forward, to where? God only knows
Feel the wind's harsh refrain like the clouds gripped my face
Saying, ""It's alright to run from all this pain""
Oh, and when it's time to go with one last breath that's in my lungs
I'll scream, ""It's all for love""
I'll scream, ""It's all for love""

[Chorus]
Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream

[Verse 2]
I can feel it up ahead where the sky meets the ground
And after that, there's only moving grey
I'm filled up with regret
With things I did or never said, just leave that well alone

[Chorus]
Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream
[Post-Chorus]
It was just a dream
Is it just a dream?
It was just a dream
It was just a dream
Was it just a dream?

[Bridge]
Now I'm standing on the edge, gazing into hell
Or is it something else? I just can't tell
And when there's nothin' left, I close my eyes and take one step
And say, ""Well, here it goes""
I say, ""Well, here it goes""

[Chorus]
Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dreamEmbed"

Right, um, so this next song is called ""Spark""
And uh, it's basically about, I feel like, I feel like life's in chapters
And um, getting, I don't know, feeling reminiscent can sometimes be a bad thing
Because you keep yourself in the last chapter
And I feel like it's all about, um
I don't know, you know, in like movies when people have those breakups and they put everything into the fire and they go, ""And it's a new dawn"" and blah, blah, blah
I feel like that's a healthy thing sometimes to just move on and just be like ""That was that, and this is now""
And uh, the lyrics of this chorus, uh, you know, ""We'll build a fire and we'll torch our old life and hope the original spark of what made it amazing survives"" and we'll just move on from it
But uh, yeah, this is ""Spark""

[Verse 1]
We've been lost for a long time
In a rut, no escape signs
And, for love, we were so blind
Oh, I hate to see you cry
There've been times where the truth lied
Now, it's clear as a blue sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a Band-Aid over deeper cuts, we tried
We couldn't stop the fate descending on the night

[Chorus]
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives
See Ed Sheeran LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, we hope the spark survives

[Verse 2]
Oh, I wonder, will we pull through?
All we ever do is argue
With not a lot, but we make do
How I wish you wouldn't say that
There are things you can't take back
When you leave, I always face facts

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a hand that's trying to hold the water back
We couldn't stop the ocean leaking in the cracks

[Chorus]
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, we hope the spark survives

[Bridge]
We've taken roads
That led to confusion
But right now, it don't matter at all (Na-na)
We'll bring it back
Our love's no illusion
The higher we go, the harder we fall, and now
[Chorus]
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, we hope the spark survives
And we hope the spark survivesEmbed"

So it was pouring with rain when Aaron sent me all these, um, songs
And the first lines of this song is ""Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass / But, God, I love the sound of heaven""
And um, yeah, this is a song, another song that was written in that batch, along with ""Borderline""
And along with the next two, well, the next one, at least
And uh, it's called ""Vega""
The Vega is, um, the brightest star in the Lyra constellation
Which, uh, that I find quite cool
I kind of like, it's, I found it really weird writing to Aaron's music 'cause
What, what happens with, Aaron basically sends a fully formed song, еssentially, and you write over it
And usually I would bе in the studio and I would get, I would pick up a guitar and I'd go, ""Right, what do we write about tonight? We do 'bad habits lead to late nights' okay, is that a good line, is it 'bad habits lead to late nights' is this-""
And you kind of go back and forth and you bounce ideas, and that's the collaborative process that I've usually done
Whereas this collaborative process is Aaron going like, ""Just write what you feel""
And I found words pouring out and some of them I was like, ""What does that even mean? 'It burns like hell to be Vega'""
Like what, but it was just a line that just came out of my mouth whilst writing this song
And, ya know, this song probably took as much time to write as the song itself, like it just fell out
Uh, and I can't describe it
Aaron's, Aaron's music has songs in it that you just have to
You know, you know like in Harry Potter when it's the pensive and say the bit out
I find that like, Aaron's song is Dumbledore's mind, basically
And you just, take out, but yeah
So, this is ""Vega""

[Verse 1]
Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass
But, God, I love the sound of heaven
Sat cross-legged on the carpet
Listenin' to vinyl, trying to ignore the weather
See Ed Sheeran LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
This week was heavy, I buckled under all the weight
What can you do, but pray?
And count your blessings, it wasn't any other way
Don't leave it up to fate

[Chorus]
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part
Light up the night, we were made to be stars
But it burns like hell to be Vega

[Verse 2]
Clouds keep forming over this house
Blocking out the sun, I'm trying to keep it all together
One door closes then one opens, gotta keep the focus
If we believe, then she'll get better

[Pre-Chorus]
The days are long, but they pass within an instant, babe
It is the strangest thing
I'll count my blessings the day I see you smile again
This war, we've got to win

[Chorus]
Keep it inside, don't let no one see your heart
No one can judge, we're the same in the dark
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part
Light up the night, we were made to be stars
But it burns like hell to be Vega
[Bridge]
Same problems, different options
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this
Need respite, bleed time dry
She'll be fine, she'll be fine
Same problems, different options
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this
Need respite, bleed time dry
She'll be fine, she'll be fine

[Outro]
Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, worrying to death
But I guess this is human nature
We are made to shine like stars, but
That don't mean it don't burn like hell to be VegaEmbed"

So, that day we got the news, uh
I got sent all these, all these songs, uh
And we were driving up to a specialist
Um, in North London to sort of get results and scans and work out what the next, next steps were
And I wrote this song, basically
I just find, like, we're born into life with love
Like, we're, we're, our parents love us and we're born in love
And hopefully we leave the same way
But yеah, this is called ""Sycamore""

[Verse 1]
Sycamore in thе summer bearing leaves
Swing, you're pushin' our daughter underneath
Flowers bloom in the garden, sway in breeze
Just imagine a world where we could be

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, in the waiting room, emotions runnin' wild
Worried 'bout my lover and I'm worried 'bout our child
Part of me was always in denial, it's gonna take a little while

[Chorus]
In our story, love in, love out
We are glorious
In our story, love in, love out

Nothin' more than a word, a smoking gun
What a puzzle is this to be in love
To be planting your roots, then dig them up

What's he gonna say after ""I think you better sit""?
Brace yourself, something's about to hit

So my dad, uh, said to me when I got married
He said, um
""You will not know what real love and marriage is
Until there's death and there's, uh, real sickness""
And he said this because, uh, that happens when he first married my mum
There was a real, real grief that happened in the family
And real, real sickness that also then ended up in grief
That they both had to go through
And he said that that really brought them together
And hе just said that once that happens it's an unbreakablе bond
And you can't, you can't ever break it
And um, ya know, I've been married now almost five years
And uh, he, ya know, I've always felt real, real closeness
But last year was when that sort of unbreakable bond was made
And I know, I know you should feel that before with, ya know, marriage and then children and then, and blah, blah, blah
But I really feel like
We got through 2022, we can get through anything, basically
And I wanna say, like, we're, we're nearing, we're nearing the end of ""Subtract"" now, too
There's two more songs, thank you for sitting through this
Little procession
This is my favorite song on the album
Might be one of my favorite songs I've, I've ever written
Uh, and it's called ""No Strings""

[Verse 1]
If we make it through this year
Then nothin' can break us
Trouble leaves, then reappears
But we've shown we can take it

And that won't change when we're fallin' apart

It's just growin' pains

[Verse 2]
If we make it through this year
We should celebrate it
Rarified atmosphere
Till now, we evaded

[Pre-Chorus]
We tore the walls down to build them up
Never was in doubt

But this is no strings, you are who I love
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love
It's just growin' pains
[Bridge]
We did not fight for love
Just to let it be defeated
What we're goin' through is common
But, it doesn't mean we don't feel it
It would be easy just to give it up
I know we've got enough reason
But every time that we have come undone

[Chorus]
I'll say, ""It's no strings, you are who I love

So, it's quite fun being a, uh, an opening act
I just wanna introduce myself
I'm a, I'm an up-and-coming singer-songwriter from Suffolk
And I'll have CDs at the merch stand afterwards
You know the last time I played this room was in 2012
For uh, for ""Plus"" and, uh
Basically I had ""The A Team"" out and that was, that was the song that people came for
And I always dreamed of playing this room and have people like this
I remember coming to watch Bon Iver here and everyone was like completely sat and silent and listening
And I was saying earlier, likе
I've been a singer-songwriter for a long timе, but, ya know
I really enjoy making pop music and I really enjoy that side of things
But this is the first time I've felt like I actually am allowed to be a singer-songwriter
I'm sort of thirty-two, I've, I've lived a bit
And I'm playing an album tonight that I feel is, uh, emotional
And I, I think you're gonna like it
And this pop point of the show is about fun
So, it's not about, uh, introspective thoughts and sadness
It is about ""Shivers""

[Verse 1]
Yeah-yeah
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar, ooh
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Oh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Oh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart, ooh
Put me back together and take my heart

Gotta be honest, I'm super nervous about tonight
Um, I never played, uh, a whole album in full with the band the way it sounds, exactly like it sounds on the record
I'm usually, this is my live set, I'm on a loop pedal and it always sounds quite different to the record
And that's kind of the way that I like it
I like, you listening to the album and coming to a gig and then just hearing it re-imagined
But because you've never heard this album I'm about to play, we can kind of give it to you exactly the way that it is on the rеcord
And you can, I'ma tell you stories from it and blah-blah-blah
But it's a, yeah, it's gonna bе, it's gonna be weird
'Cause these stories are all real stories that happened in my life
And, uh, I often find when you release music, the music then belongs to the public
So the next song I'm gonna play, it's been out for a while
I wrote it about my wife, but it now belongs to all of you
And you guys hear this song, you don't think, ""Ah, Ed's wife""
You think about the person, uh, that, that you love
But the thing is with the songs I'm about to play you is
They don't belong to you yet, they're gonna start belonging to you tonight
And, uh, well, I mean, one of them, ""Eyes Closed"" has been out for a couple of days
And it's been nice, sort of, hearing the stories of that
But anyway, this is a song that I wrote back in 2015 that used to belong to me
And now belongs to all of you

[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
See Ed Sheeran LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
But I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

[Pre-Chorus]
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favourite song
I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

[Bridge]
Mm, mm, mm

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person, she looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonightEmbed"

Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox

For Hammersmith, thank you so much for having me, as an opening act for me
I'm gonna come back on, the show is gonna be very different to this
These are very, uh, upbeat songs, the album is not that upbeat, I'm warning you, um
It means a lot to me, thank you so much for being here
And, uh, I hope you like it
I hope you enjoy the finished film when it's out

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodеs
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to latе nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say

And after that, there's only moving grey
I am filled up with regret

It was just a dream
Was it just a dream?

[Bridge]
Now, I'm standing on the edge, gazing into hell
Or is it somethin' else? I just can't tell
When there's nothin' left, I close my eyes and take one step
And say, ""Well, here it goes,"" I say, ""Well, here it goes""

[Chorus]
Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else

[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе

[Chorus]
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on

So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you

What a way to start off the day with you

Start a discussion to pick a singer
This one, you'll love it, I had to bring her
Just let the speakers take you away

[Chorus]
And drop the needle on Dusty
Frost on the leaves like a lake
The moment came out of nothin'
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in the low tide
But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty

I've been depressed since you left, tried to fill the hole with wine
Stopped the drugs when she came, cleaned my act up overnight
If you reach with no reply, I'll see you when I see you, man
You can't talk me through the fall if we don't know if I can land
Tried to grow, but the past, it tears me down to size
Tell the world how to process, but don't take the same advice
Half remember what I say, then the morning's filled with fear
Can't get a handle on my grief when every memory turns to tears

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there

[Chorus]
Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low

[Post-Chorus]
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth

[Verse 2]
I've been lost since the teens, but pretend it's all alright
All my ups led to falls that led to trying to end my life
Just a boy at the start, they lent on like a man
You were meant to be my friend and not to take all that you can
Disengaged to create, try to reinvent the wheel
No one knows what they want, so I just give you what I feel
If I slip and get high, I know the low is always near
When I'm down, I never see you, when I'm up, you all appear

And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass
But, God, I love the sound of heaven
Sat cross-legged on the carpet
Listenin' to vinyl, trying to ignore the weather

[Pre-Chorus]
This week was heavy, I buckled under all the weight
What can you do, but pray?
And count your blessings, it wasn't any other way
Don't leave it up to fate

[Chorus]
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part
Light up the night, we were made to be stars
But it burns like hell to be Vega

[Verse 2]
Clouds keep forming over this house
Blocking out the sun, I'm tryna keep it all together
One door closes then one opens, gotta keep the focus
If we believe, then she'll get better

[Pre-Chorus]
The days are long, but they pass within an instant, babe
It is the strangest thing
I'll count my blessings the day I see you smile again
This war, we've got to win

Keep it inside, don't let no one see your heart
No one can judge, we're the same in the dark
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part
Light up the night, we were made to be stars
But it burns like hell to be Vega

[Bridge]
Same problems, different options
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this
Need rest-bite, bleed time dry
She'll be fine, she'll be fine
Same problems, different options
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this
Need rest-bite, bleed time dry
She'll be fine, she'll be fine

[Outro]
Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, worrying to death
But I guess this is human nature
We are made to shine like stars, but
That don't mean it don't burn like hell to be Vega1Embed"

Sycamore in the summer bearing leaves
Swing, you're pushin' our daughter underneath
Flowers bloom in the garden, sway in breeze
Just imagine a world where we could be

[Pre-Chorus]
Right now, in the waiting room, emotions runnin' wild
Worried 'bout my lover and I'm worried 'bout our child
And part of me was always in denial, it's gonna take a little while

But in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
Well, in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious

Sycamore bringing shade from beating sun
Nothin' more than a word, a smoking gun
What a puzzlе is this to be in love
To be planting your roots, thеn dig them up

Oh, the leaves are covered in snow
And the water's frozen
Oh, I long for you to be the one that I'm holdin'
And warm me down to my bones
As you lay beside me, hold me close
Oh, the leaves are starting to fall
And the sun grows cold
And my heart might break from the weight of it all
For all that I know
You could be holding somebody else as close

[Chorus]
And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you
Darlin', we could fall in lovе 'neath the hills of Aberfеldy

Oh, the ground is slowly melting
And the sun beats strong
And I feel like my feet may have wandered too long
And I will remain here alone
'Cause I fear that you may have found someone

[Chorus]
And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you
But, darlin', we could fall in love 'neath the hills of Aberfeldy

To reach the end, we must begin to feel it
Lie and trace you on the grass, hair that makеs a question mark

Consumed by hopelessness and all my worries

There's still so far to go and I can't feel my toes
When the rain soaks through the heels and slips to the sole
Yeah, the blades are two feet tall, I wade in green
I'm movin' forward, to where? God only knows
Feel the wind's harsh refrain like the clouds gripped my face
Saying, ""It's alright to run from all this pain""
Oh, and when it's time to go with one last breath that's in my lungs
I'll scream, ""It's all for love,"" I'll scream, ""It's all for love""

[Chorus]
Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream

[Verse 2]
I can see it up ahead where the sky meets the ground
And after that, there's only moving grey
I am filled up with regret
With things I did or never said, just leave that well alone

[Chorus]
And come kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream

Now, I'm standing on the edge, gazing into hell
Or is it somethin' else? I just can't tell
When there's nothin' left, I close my eyes and take one step

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else

[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе

[Chorus]
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do

I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?

Sunlight is framin' our every moment
What a way to start off the day with you

Start a discussion to pick a singer
This one, you'll love it, I had to bring her
Just let the speakers take you away

[Chorus]
And drop the needle on Dusty
Frost on the leaves like a lake
The moment came out of nothin'
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in the low tide
But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty

I've been depressed since you left, tried to fill the hole with wine
Stopped the drugs when she came, cleaned my act up overnight
If you reach with no reply, I'll see you when I see you, man
You can't talk me through the fall if we don't know if I can land
Tried to grow, but the past, it tears me down to size
Tell the world how to process, but don't take the same advice
Half remember what I say, then the morning's filled with fear
Can't get a handle on my grief when every memory turns to tears

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there

[Chorus]
Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low

[Post-Chorus]
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth

[Verse 2]
I've been lost since the teens, but pretend it's all alright
All my ups led to falls that led to trying to end my life
Just a boy at the start, they lent on like a man
You were meant to be my friend and not to take all that you can
Disengaged to create, try to reinvent the wheel
No one knows what they want, so I just give you what I feel
If I slip and get high, I know the low is always near

There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

But I don't even know how all of this began

We've been lost for a long time
In a rut, no escape signs
And, for love, we were so blind
Oh, I hate to see you cry
There've been times where the truth lied
Now, it's clear as a blue sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a Band-Aid over deeper cuts, we tried
We couldn't stop the fate descending on the night

[Chorus]
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, we hope the spark survives

[Verse 2]
Oh, I wonder, will we pull through?
All we ever do is argue
With not a lot, but we make do
How I wish you wouldn't say that
There are things you can't take back
When you leave, I always face facts

But right now, that don't matter at all (Na-na)

The higher we go, the harder we fall, and now

Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass
But, God, I love the sound of heaven
Sat cross-legged on the carpet
Listenin' to vinyl, trying to ignore the weather

[Pre-Chorus]
This week was heavy, I buckled under all the weight
What can you do, but pray?
And count your blessings, it wasn't any other way
Don't leave it up to fate

[Chorus]
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part
Light up the night, we were made to be stars
But it burns like hell to be Vega

Clouds keep forming over this house
Blocking out the sun, I'm tryna keep it all together
One door closes then one opens, gotta keep the focus
If we believe, then she'll get better

Worried 'bout my lover and I'm worried 'bout our child
And part of me was always in denial, it's gonna take a little while

Nothin' more than a word, a smoking gun
What a puzzlе is this to be in love
To be planting your roots, thеn dig them up

And warm me down to my bones
As you lay beside me, hold me close
Oh, the leaves are starting to fall
And the sun grows cold
And my heart might break from the weight of it all
For all that I know
You could be holding somebody else as close

And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you
Darlin', we could fall in lovе 'neath the hills of Aberfеldy

Oh, the ground is slowly melting
And the sun beats strong
And I feel like my feet may have wandered too long
And I will remain here alone
'Cause I fear that you may have found someone

And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you

I heard you callin', now my eyes are open
The day is breakin' into powder blue
Sunlight is framin' our every moment
What a way to start off the day with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Flick a finger
Start a discussion to pick a singer
This one, you'll love it, I had to bring her
Just let the speakers take you away

[Chorus]
And drop the needle on Dusty
Frost on the leaves like a lake
The moment came out of nothin'
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in the low tide
But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty

[Verse 2]
We were lost within a stormy ocean
Nobody knew what we were going through
We talk about it as we dip our toes in
Take a breath and brace for the waves with you

There's more than sadness we got within us
Let's put some colour into the grey

A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright

But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty

[Bridge]
Nothing static on the stereo before today (Before today)
Both on the edge to throw it all away (Throw it all away)
I used to think that every situation stayed the same (The same)
But I can see it start to change (Start to change), okay

Drop the needle on Dusty

I've been depressed since you left, tried to fill the hole with wine
Stopped the drugs when she came, cleaned my act up overnight
If you reach with no reply, I'll see you when I see you, man
You can't talk me through the fall if we don't know if I can land
Tried to grow, but the past, it tears me down to size
Tell the world how to process, but don't take the same advice
Half remember what I say, then the morning's filled with fear
Can't get a handle on my grief when every memory turns to tears

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there

[Chorus]
Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low

[Post-Chorus]
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth

[Verse 2]
I've been lost since the teens, but pretend it's all alright
All my ups led to falls that led to trying to end my life
Just a boy at the start, they lent on like a man
You were meant to be my friend and not to take all that you can
Disengaged to create, try to reinvent the wheel
No one knows what they want, so I just give you what I feel
If I slip and get high, I know the low is always near
When I'm down, I never see you, when I'm up, you all appear

Hide and seek, I am somewhere closed away
You won't believe how long it's been since I started the game
I can't be seen and you won't find me today
I've not been this low, but I'll be okay

""Are you alright?"" Maybe don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back
And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold
The day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me

Engulfed in darkness, shielded from my eyes

Which way will I?

But I don't even know how all of this began
And we are made to mould and bend
How can I wish for nothing when it's still a sin?

We should celebrate it
Rarified atmosphere
Till now, we evaded

We tore the walls down to build them up
Never was in doubt

'Cause this is no strings, you are who I love
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love
It's just growin' pains

[Bridge]
We did not fight for love
Just to let it be defeated
What we're goin' through is common
But doesn't mean we don't feel it
It would be easy just to give it up
Guess we've got enough reasons
But every time that we have come undone

[Chorus]
I'll say, ""It's no strings, you are who I love

Oh, the leaves are covered in snow
And the water's frozen
Oh, I long for you to be the one that I'm holdin'
And warm me down to my bones
As you lay beside me, hold me close
Oh, the leaves are starting to fall
And the sun grows cold
And my heart might break from the weight of it all
For all that I know
You could be holding somebody else as close

[Chorus]
And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you
Darlin', we could fall in lovе 'neath the hills of Aberfеldy

[Verse 2]
Oh, the ground is slowly melting
And the sun beats strong
And I feel like my feet may have wandered too long
And I will remain here alone
'Cause I fear that you may have found someone

[Chorus]
And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you
But, darlin', we could fall in love 'neath the hills of Aberfeldy
Darling, we could fall in love 'neath the hills of Aberfeldy

Ivy vines that clothe the tree, daisies look and take a peak
Sun takes colours from the green and bleaches
December white, a cotton dress, open lawn to make a nest
Try to think what I love best in your features

You were born to run and run till you find your fire
I saw what you'd become, I know, I know
Blossoming among the wildflowers, flowers

Daggers wide, they cut through skin, a new addition to your grin
To reach the end, we must begin to feel it
Lie and trace you on the grass, hair that makеs a question mark
You'll always be in my heart, I mеan it

Perfect time to be trying
But we need to wait and read between the lines
Stay inside, the windows dying
I don't wanna see the sadness in your eyes
You could say we got a long way to go, I won't
'Cause when tomorrow comes, you'll never know, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
And even though we're waitin' on a miracle
Well, I believe in us
Just be here with me and turn the world off
And that will be enough

We could take a day, imagine it
Make paper planes and fly
Stare off into space
Go to a place that all the hurt will die
Balance all and everything
Balance and see what the dawn brings

Every second wasted is a little lie
Your mood is my reflection
And though I get it wrong, you know I really try

Every moment when you took my joy away
All the memoriеs mean nothin' from today

But I never wanna hear your name again
And go back to how it was before you came

This is the last time I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I used to cry, but then, was it a crime too?
I spent a lifetime tryna make the right moves
And got myself caught in a pattern, babe
You take a smile and then you turn it to dust
You take what's golden and you, somehow, make rust
Every lie, it made it harder to trust
But now it doesn't even matter

[Pre-Chorus]
If you come back
It's like we never even had that
Every moment when you took my joy away
All the memories mean nothin' from today
Up to now, I never hold back
True emotion made me feel sad
But I never wanna hear your name again
And go back to how it was before you came

[Chorus]
Start movin' on, movin' on
I feel on a roll since you've been gone
Start movin' on, movin' on

I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it

[Pre-Chorus]
Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with mе

[Chorus]
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And lifе, life is changin' tides

[Verse 2]
I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do

Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm

The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words, down on one knee
You said, ""Darling, are you jokin'?"", and I just said, ""Please""

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control

Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't

Oh, yeah, we been in the rain
Been on the rocks, but we found our way
We've ordered pizza to an aeroplane
Slept on the beach like we were castaways
We've been in the storm
Been to an Irish bar in central Rome
Driven to hospitals with broken bones
We've shared a toothbrush and shared our home

[Pre-Chorus]
We've seen the moon reflect on the rollin' tide
Been up at 5AM, watchin' the sunrise
Because thе world looks better when I'm by your sidе
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

[Chorus]
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life

We've watched the blossom fall to Earth like snow
Fumbled in cubicles in Tokyo
And been to funerals in rented clothes

You brought me to the morning through my darkest night
Yeah, the world hurts less when I'm by your side

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

[Chorus]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat

Another human cloud to bring you down
When you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown
But for me, they look the same
Well, sometimes, it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day

[Chorus]
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Another ""I, Me, Mine"" to blur the lines
Between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinkin' you're right
And always shiftin' blame
And every time it's gettin' more and more ugly

'Cause it's been a while and I apologize

Chasin' a moment I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes

Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darlin', that dress reminds
Me of the first time

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight

It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves, and I apologize
Sometimes, you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'
And I brush it off because there's always somethin'
But I need to change my perspective

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you

[Chorus]
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

[Verse 2]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

[Chorus]
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away

[Verse 3]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time (Mmh)
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all (Yeah)

Ed Sheeran]

[Couplet 1: Vianney]
C'est l'heure où les videurs deviennent gentils
Même avec les gens qui font peur et sont pas beaux la nuit
Ces pieds qui collent me donnent le sentiment
Qu'il faut qu'on dorme maintenant
Quand dans la boîte, c'est moite et t'es pas là
Que c'est bientôt ""Les lacs du Connemara""
J'tente de danser pour plus penser mais panser le passé

[Pré-refrain: Ed Sheeran]
J'fais comme si j'avais l'habitude de tout ça
Je la sens, la solitude, sans toi

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran & Vianney]
Call on me, brother
I should let it be over
Every high, every low, they will come then they'll go
To feel alive you've gotta take the blows, you know
So call on me, please, brother

[Couplet 2: Ed Sheeran]
It is the nights when I'm drunk that it hits me most
Feels like it opens up a door I was keeping closed
It comes in waves and then it settles
Say it would end but I know it won't
Well, I've been in a right mess, God, yes
Since you left me here alone
Every time your name gets brought up
I get caught with the tears that will overflow

I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it

[Pre-Chorus]
Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with mе

[Chorus]
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And lifе, life is changin' tides

[Verse 2]
I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

And I can't wait to make a million more first times

Was four little words, down on one knee

Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't

And burned till the fun ran out, now

Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love

[Pre-Chorus]
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

[Chorus]
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

[Verse 2]
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me

I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever

Driven to hospitals with broken bones
We've shared a toothbrush and shared our home

Been up at 5AM, watchin' the sunrise

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

[Chorus]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved

Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less than she needs

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you

[Chorus]
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

[Verse 2]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

[Chorus]
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away

[Verse 3]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky
And lovin' you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song
Whatever you feel could never be wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

[Chorus]
And dream
Hangin' out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hangin' out with the Sandman
Although there's rain outside, you'll bе warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my lovе
Hangin' out with the Sandman

[Verse 2]
Chocolate-covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields, we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds sing your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

And fracture the light

And just when it ends

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

[Pre-Chorus]
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

[Chorus]
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

[Verse 2]
The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth

Why am I feelin' so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect? And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you

And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight)
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life

A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth

""Don't  you know we're only human?"", is what I heard you say
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause  I have felt the same, no

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?

She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, darlin', here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart

Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all
See Ed Sheeran LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also like[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Lil Baby]
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us (Baby)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Sun comin' up when we walk out, we lost the track of time
Everything that I'd been dealin' with ain't even crossed my mind
I don't see nobody in here but us, for real, for you, I'm blind
We go anywhere, don't take much for us to catch a vibe
Come here, I need to tell you somethin', let me whisper in your ear
Do whatever to get you there, I'll put you on a Lear, yeah
Private island for a month straight, they'll think you disappeared
Lamb truck'll look good on you, I'm coppin' you that Urus
I think I'm 'bout ready to make love in this club
Only thing I need is my drink and my drugs
I done got on ten and forgot where I was
Some parts I don't like, but this part I love
Only me and my guys
I been havin' me a good time, you can see it all in my eyes
Two-steppin' with shawty, got her rockin' side to side
You should let me know when you get ready to ride 'cause

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Lil Baby, Both]
We'll go all night

Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lеad to you

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
(Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Oli Sykes]
Every pure intention еnds when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays

[Verse 2]
What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, yeah

[Verse 2: Ultimo]
Quando mi dai poco voglio troppo da te, però
Quando mi dai troppo non capisco cos'è
Vorrei sparire di botto
Come la pioggia d'agosto
Poi dimostrarti che torno
In fondo l'amore è il ritorno, però
Siediti che ti racconto
Come si può nella vita stare in piedi
Senza che nessuno paghi per te il conto
Ed esser oggi quel che tu sognavi ieri?
Come ho fatto a non vederlo nei miei occhi
Che ho già dentro quel che io cercavo fuori?
Dai, sarà che c'ho il destino in tasca
E lo decido io se un giorno questo cambia

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Ultimo, Both]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night

Och när hon kommer, vet exakt vad hon söker
Jag behöver ingen stress, kallar hellre henne ex

Tell me what goes up that doesn't go down
We're supposed to go up, but she's too cold now
Why she even play me, are you crazy? Oh

She got me feeling like the best

So we press play and step to the beat

Two-steppin' with the woman I love, love
Yeah, los geht's, los geht's

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran, reezy, Both]
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep (Wasn't that deep)
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now (We forget)

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us (Los geht's)

[Verse 2: reezy]
All we need is love
Doch liebe fällt so schwer bei den Problemen in mein' Kopf (Kopf)
PTSD hält mich wach am Block
Mein Herz ist 26, meine Seele 52 (Yeah)
Ich weiß, nicht alles, was ich mache, ist vernünftig (No)
Du warst so wie Weed, wir kannten uns nur flüchtig
Doch dann wurd ich süchtig, seitdem trägt das ganze Früchte
Mit dir halt' ich es einhundert, weil du warst immer echt (Real)
Ich hab' hundert K in Duffle-Bag (Bag)
Sie gibt mir ein'n Haargummi, ich pack's um die Racks
Ich weiß, spar'n wär nicht schlecht, doch

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified

I know I promised you the world when I didn't have it
You say I'm a liar, I don't care but that's a bit dramatic
You know I've got enough stress, I'm living post-traumatic
I know we're bigger than a picture or a silly caption
I like you in real life, I'm bendin' over backwards
And love the way you love me, I find you so attractive
Flight mode, we don't need no distractions
And we ain't walkin' down the street unless you hold my handgun
Maybe I'm just a schmuck who really can't believe his luck
But he's just hopin' he's enough, feel like me, we had it hard
So we learned to adjust and take thе smooth with the rough
Your skin's smooth to the touch, I got juice in my cup
Shе know I ain't like them fools in the club
I'm grindin' so we got a house on the hill
A boat for the cane and a pool for the a tub
'Til then I'm two-steppin' in the mud

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race

I still wonder where the time's gone (Am I wrong?)
Sometimes I don't wanna be strong (They alarm)
With all these expectations of what I should be
CC'd in so many threads that I can't see me
Even when I'm struggling
I bless my enemies so much they feel they owe me something
Shatter pains like ceilings, even when I barely function

Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me

So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas

The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all
Spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it

[Pre-Chorus]
Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with mе

[Chorus]
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And lifе, life is changin' tides

[Verse 2]
I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, ""Ooh, I love it when you do it like that""

When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm

The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words, down on one knee
You said, ""Darling, are you jokin'?"", and I just said, ""Please""

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true

Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love

Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

[Chorus]
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

[Verse 2]

I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us

And hearts that would give you a diamond ring

Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified

Another human cloud to bring you down
When you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown
But for me, they look the same
Well, sometimes, it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day

[Chorus]
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

[Post-Chorus]
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Another ""I, Me, Mine"" to blur the lines
Between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinkin' you're right
And always shiftin' blame
And every time it's gettin' more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

Chasin' a moment I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes

Maybe just press rewind
Darlin', that dress reminds
Me of the first time

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you

[Chorus]
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

[Verse 2]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

[Chorus]
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away

[Verse 3]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet

I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it

When you are in my arms, it always will
And lifе, life is changin' tides

I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

I still feel the first fight and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love

[Pre-Chorus]
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

[Chorus]
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

[Verse 2]
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

And hearts that would give you a diamond ring

You came to the table and you went all in

Driven to hospitals with broken bones
We've shared a toothbrush and shared our home

Been up at 5AM, watchin' the sunrise

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

[Chorus]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night

Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less than she needs

Chasin' a moment I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes

Maybe just press rewind

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you

[Chorus]
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

[Verse 2]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

[Chorus]
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away

[Verse 3]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away21Embed"

You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky
And lovin' you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song
Whatever you feel could never be wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

[Chorus]
And dream
Hangin' out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hangin' out with the Sandman
Although there's rain outside, you'll bе warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my lovе
Hangin' out with the Sandman

[Verse 2]
Chocolate-covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields, we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds sing your song

A lifetime is startin' to feel like
It's fallin' short of the mark
But it's all that we got
Every teardrop, every wrong turn
Made the moment we found
And it's comin' around, around, around, around, around

[Chorus]
I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

[Verse 2]
The shadows cling to the ceiling
And fracture the light
That lands in our eyes
Every moment changes the whole view
And just when it ends
I feel it again, again, again, again, again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between

Ooh

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran & Tion Wayne]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
(Grr, mm-mm, yeah)

[Verse 2: Tion Wayne & Ed Sheeran]
Feds havin' nightmares when I got my ice
Gyal up on my left side, gyal up on my right (Mm-mm)
Six figure transfer when I cop my ride (Baow, baow, baow)
That's why the opps them just wanna take my life
Before the music, had to put a shift in (Damn)
Made Lambo money from a Citröen (Boom)
I was tapped then, rolling with my kitchen
That's why they want me just lock up in thе system
Bad habits in my life, in my veins (In my vеins)
Bad habits in the nine with a babe (Boom)
Bad habits, can't end up with a case
Man, them bad vibes just haffi go away
'Cause I was broke, getting Ps weren't easy (Easy)
I'm with Sheeran now, it's cheeky (Mad)
Feds can't believe I'm on TV
They're havin' flashbacks of CCTV
Tough luck (Ooh), he got brucked up (Ooh)
In my drop-top (Ooh), getting top-top (Boom)
And my young buck, if he catch an opp-opp
No Double-E ting, bidda-bop-bop (Boom)
But fuck what you're tellin' 'em (Buh), I'm from Edmonton (Buh)
Bad vibes everyting ****
Rolex or I might bust it on skeleton (Buh, buh, buh)
(My bad habits lead to you)

I don't wanna go on a mad one
Them say somethin' I can't come back from
Frontways, sideways, cowgirl, backshots
Mr. Miyagi, wax off, wax on
I don't even smoke, she want a backstrap one
Messed up with my good girl and a sad one
Now I'm in a hotel room with a bad one
Strapped up, I don't wanna give mum a grandson
These ladies moving crazy, uh
Wanna have babies by me
Lately I've been keepin' my head down
Ain't been wildin', takin' time out
Cards laid out, got nothin' to hide 'bout
Ayy, maybe I slipped up once on a night out
If she find out 'bout that, she wild out
The sex feel better when you make up
After you break up, all body language
Don't wanna say much
We could go back to the AP and lay up
Or fuck in the back of the Bentley Bentayga
Come home late, she wake, she stayin' up
Body intact, no personal trainer
Breakfast in bed, don't cook me no bacon
I just want head when I wake up
[Chorus: Tion Wayne & Central Cee]
I got gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold

[Verse 4: Tion Wayne & Central Cee]
Bad night if we back out the pumpy (Grr)
Bad sight when me keep up the fuckery (Baow)
If I bang him in the face, can't stop me (Mm-mm)
Bad time, but today I'm lucky
Yo, in the rave with the gauge (Baow)
Bad habits, can't end up in a cage (Boom)
Bang at anyone, straight in the face (Baow, baow, mm-mm)
She left me on read back then when I had no bread
Like shorty didn't trust the process
Free all the guys locked down four walls
When I think 'bout that, I get claustrophobic
Pure cocaine, no bakin' soda
Lot of ammonia, I don't condone it
But you gotta do what you gotta do
When you're stuck in the hood just hopin'
I-I-I was lickin' 'em, stickin' them, left as an artist
Dylan just fill up and empty the cartridge
Do it like Sheringham, shoot up the rahted
Think I won't pull up and bark it (Baow, baow)
When I fly out the M-way, I feel nostalgic
Yay come white like yam, it ain't pounded
Looking for cribs, just fully detached
I came from council housin'
Not in a talk-the-talk, I really walk the walk
Man, this a masterclass, man you can ask the charts
Richard Mille on, you don't know the pass, the password
When it's really on, Wizzy gotta clart it off
No fears 'cah I'm good on the roads where I'm from
You can ask, I'm calm as long as my darg is
Always aim at the target market
Look at the profit margin
[Chorus: Tion Wayne & Central Cee]
I got a gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold

[Outro: Central Cee & Tion Wayne]
Fumez The Engineer
If bro calls me and say it's time, I don't care
I'm putting my ca-, I'm putting my career on hold
But why everyone, but why everyone
But why everyone there when you blow?7Embed"

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people

L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)

Anything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you

Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me

And she ain't messin' with no other man
And me and her have something different
I really need all you to understand
That nobody's comin' close
And I don't ever wanna run around
I spent my youth jumpin' in and out
But you know I fuckin' love her now
Like nobody ever could

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh, no

Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

[Verse 3: Stormzy & Ed Sheeran]
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrappin' it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feelin' alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]

My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran with YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict

But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no ""if,"" ""ands,"" or ""buts"" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Drinkin' fast, and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questionin' what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're livin' your dream, man, this **** should be fun
Please, know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
[Post-Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Bridge]
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?

[Outro]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine

As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love

She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one-way trip
Guess she went wanderin' off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole

[Pre-Chorus]
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh, my baby, lately, I know

[Chorus]
That every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells, ah
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh

I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on the things my family's given to me
Just love and understandin', positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go

I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case

And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me
From each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee
And all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time

In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 2]
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs

'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground

Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and, in return, I gave a song
It goes on and on

I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 2]
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon? 'Cause from here, it looks the same
And only scars remain

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell

But if I don't, then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger, but I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong 'cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf

So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself25Embed"

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questionin' what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothin' could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're livin' your dream, man, this **** should be fun
Please, know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you111Embed"

Na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to

I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to

She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one-way trip
Guess she went wanderin' off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole

[Pre-Chorus]
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh, my baby, lately, I know

[Chorus]
That every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells, ah
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh

I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on the things my family's given to me

Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go

I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won't you let me know?
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

[Verse 2]
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here, so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
[Verse 3]
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""Re: Stacks"" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watchin' a DVD, smokin' illegal weed
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

And every weekend in the winter, you'll be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watchin' Blue Planet, creatin' new habits
Actin' as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be takin' a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
[Bridge]
Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina

But then again, you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Lovin' can hurt

But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'

And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me

Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

As if no one knows anything but us

They just fade out when you take a breath

Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now, I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder
[Chorus]
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own50Embed"

Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waitin' for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But **** it
I won't be changin' the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothin', I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is, you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married, then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

[Verse 2]
Recently, I'll tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to ""Holocene""
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to Uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad
And he told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore

[Verse 3]
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writin' a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral
And it's just hidin' my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writin' my will before I'm twenty-seven, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby

Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm

And now you're lyin' in the bed again

I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spittin' quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me rippin' the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew, but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now, it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoidin' the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years, I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleepin' at a subway station
To sleepin' with a movie star and addin' to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now

[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again, that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whisperin', ""Everything that happens is from now on""
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still, they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then, I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rappin' a habit and keep on fashionin' magic
I'm battlin' for respect and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet
I'll take it back now

[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
I'll take it back now
[Verse 3]
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Puttin' on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considerin' a name change, thinkin' it was hopeless
Rhymin' over recordings, avoidin' tradition
'Cause every day, some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now, absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, livin' life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowin' up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screamin' out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achievin' life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never havin' a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Havin' a pint with McDaid, discussin' records we made
And, every single second, knowin' that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, rememberin' our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now
[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us

And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky's fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out

[Chorus]
Now, I see fire inside the mountains
I see fire burnin' the trees
I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (Oh, you know I saw a city burnin' out)
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin)
And I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side262Embed"

It's just another night and I'm starin' at the moon
I saw a shootin' star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?

[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

[Verse 2]
I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playin' ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love

So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beatin' to

The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead

Across the sea by the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me

So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me

[Chorus]
I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

[Verse 3]
I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me ""son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea""

Ooh

[Verse 1]
Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
And now this bar has closed its doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?

[Pre-Chorus]
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn
Oh, no, no, the sun could rise
Burnin' all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again

[Chorus]
Until the night turns into mornin', you'll be in my arms
We'll just keep drivin' along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darlin', please, don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

Said, ""The world is moving too fast""
And you don't know where to begin
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fittin' in
Only to wind up on the other side by yourself

And every day, screamin' out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know

And every song that plays is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry, but I'm saying maybe that's a waste of water
You know I'm here for ya in the back of the taxi cab tonight

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
[Verse 3]
'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aimin' it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights at stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus, I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa
Givin' a dose of what the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus, I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growin' up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, readin' all the papers
They say I'm up and comin' like I'm fucking in an elevator
[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll
Take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll
Make things disappear, dear

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you

[Chorus 1]
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you

[Verse 2]
Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

[Pre-Chorus]
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo)

[Chorus]
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps, then that makes two

[Verse 2]
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
And the shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company when I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh

But if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird

If we take a walk out in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little homemade tea
And if you fall asleep, then, at least, you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say, ""It's late, love, get back to sleep""

She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5:01 like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed and I'm way too tired
Hoodie still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high

[Chorus]
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you

[Verse 2]
When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention, as she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency to finish off her sentence?
Oh, well, she's a local girl
No make-up 'cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
Is it fast food? I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna go alone

No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair

Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself

[Verse 2]
And we've got that love in us, so if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night 'til the floor feel us
If we talk outside, so you hate wasps, too?
I don't really dance, so I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that’s alright, I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don't mind sharing
She said, ""I wanna take off what you're wearing""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone

Sew your heart to my sleeve

Shooting stars, if it helps you sleep

Warm me up with your lips

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it’s late
And sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control what I’m into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
My hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don’t control what I’m into

[Pre-Chorus]
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

[Chorus]
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two

[Verse 2]
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
So I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I’m used to
And the shop across the road
Fulills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it
Past tomorrow

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this
To keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I
Need to move along

[Verse 3]
I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me
[Pre-Chorus]
And London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I’d never leave her
But now I’m ready to go
And strange as it seems
She’s endless to me
She’s just like paperwork
But harder to read

[Chorus]
Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

[Verse 2]
I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn’t sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way

Hello, everyone! Yay, we're so near the time for Ed! It's so exciting! Woohoo! Um... just wanted to say a couple more things: just remember that we are filming this for a DVD that you guys are going to be able to buy and tonight is being recorded for a live EP that you guys will also be able to buy so... I think we'd all agree that we're all a part of something really special because we're going to be able to take tonight home in a few weeks (cheering) So yeah, big honor for us all to be here and... I just want to personally say a big thank-you to Ed for asking me to um-- host tonight because it's just amazing and I think he's fantastic and I feel honored to be here. So that's it! It's time to welcome the fantastic Ed Sheeran to the stage. Make some noise!

[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus 1]
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

Could I wake up next to you
When we're hitting double figures
Look into your eyes
Like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer
Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn
It's hers to get hurt
On a late night
Coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face
I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

Flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired
So I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
But I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1

You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet?

So this is the part where everyone gets a bit involved and uh... I introduce myself. My name is Ed Sheeran and it's a pleasure to be here. Who's up for singing a bit, yeah? The lyrics are ""It's not a homeless life for me / It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be"" That's a little bit of a sing-song right now

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Can't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

[Pre-Chorus]
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home

[Chorus]
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

[Verse 2]
The pavement is my friend
And it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

[Rap Verse]
I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me
[Pre-Chorus]
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

On the last few days of LA, I got taken into this guy's house and he was sponsored by an alcohol company---quite a few actually---and uh-- got pretty wasted, umm-- all times and I was sitting underneath a tree with my phone just putting in lyrics, ""Bah! This is how I feel. Bah!"" And uh... I came up with this song and it is called ""Wake Me Up""
Because I was really pissed, it is quite silly. Bear that in mind

[Verse 1]
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles

Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

[Chorus]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Because we've watched it 12 times
And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say

I know I've always been shit at computer games
Because your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets

[Chorus]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
[Verse 3]
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try to get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

Playing a different show
Every night in front of a new crowd
That's new now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won`t hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me

I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free

Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music

Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody

But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!
Now my eyes are red

[Chorus]
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you

[Spoken]
Okay so this is the breakdown bit where we get a little bit funky. Ugh, and I forget about the whole week, you forget about the whole week, the whole weekend. Just forget about everything! 'Cause it's Sunday and we're all gonna get drunk after this and have a very, very good time and I'm not stressed anymore. We're just letting it unwind. I wanna split the room in the middle here. Who's up for that? Not, not, not literally. You don't have to literally divide. It's all good, all good. Peace and love, peace and love and harmony. What was I gonna say? This side, up there, are you with me? This side, up there, are you with me? Everyone scream as loud as you can! (screaming) Okay, so we found out that everyone's voices work. This side, I'm not gonna insult you but you are West Ham, okay? You're West Ham, yeah? You're West Ham Football Club. Get in the geezer mode, yeah? This side, you're Millwall, yeah? You two, you two hate each other. You two are gonna beat each other at whatever you do, no matter what. So if I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. If I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. Are you all up for that? Millwall, are you ready? (yeah!) West Ham, are you ready? (yeah!) Okay, West Ham, you sing this...

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

Millwall, you sing this:
My eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, (my eyes are red!)
(You need me, man, I don't need you)
(You need me, man, my eyes are red!)
You need me, man, I don't need you
Millwall are winning I think

[Verse 5]
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

[Interlude]
I got my friend, very good friend Random Impulse. He's gonna come up and he's gonna spit a few bars on the beat. Everyone give it up for Random Impulse!

[Verse 6: Random Impulse]
Yo!
In this game, I am my own damn man, no restriction, post or boundaries
Spouting heat, hungry and my circle always round to eat
Crossing circles, counting thousands at a thousand feet
Counting sheep and he's sound asleep
Summoned from the deep, now I float, to sink my boat, you'll need a thousand fleets
Walk on any beat and stomp it like a thousand feet
Talk is cheap, so I could treat you to my words for free
Now that I'm out, man, I ain't playing like I hurt my knee
It's common courtesy, I left you for a minute
Now I'm back and packing punches like I'm Popeye popping spinach
Eating every course... lunch, I ain't forgotten dinners
Play guitars as well as bars so you ain't rocking with beginners
Sorry, time's ticking, I can't mess with up-and-comers
National lottery business, only winners have my numbers
Man I'm nothing like you fronters, show you how it is
I can't really do nothing for you 'less you got something to give, Ed!

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me

[Verse 7]
I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Later!
Thank you... thank you so much! See you soon!Embed"

I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be

[Verse 2: Devlin]
5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed?
It's D-E-V to the Zed
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran]
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those
That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy
Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be
On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro
Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die)
[Verse 4: Devlin]
Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information
And then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed""
What less did you bloody expect from 'em?""
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake

[Hook]

The thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots
What's better than thinking about the ones you love?
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you

[Verse 2: Wiley]
I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say ""Yes Nan""
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying ""Yes Nan""
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm gone I want my music to play
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it
I work round the clock I don't stop at night

Hmm, let me go
To see my family
Please, Father, let me go
As my mother sleeps

[Verse 1: P Money]
I don't know about James bond
But round here nobody lives twice
When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me, I nearly lost my life
3 weeks after I got this ride
Pissed like I had way too much wine
Wished I didn't get one
Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set
Even though I didn't have a set one
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
20 minutes later I was on the M1
Tired, but I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No motion in my face
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going
Woke up, lorry, flash
Panic, break, skid, crash
Skidded more, bang, smash
Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled, didn't even know my name
Fainted, too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again

Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please, Father, let me go
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps

[Verse 2: P Money]
Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open
I could hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning
One of the worst situations I've been in
I could hear all of the angels singing
But when they stopped humming
My brain turned on, started running
Still in pain, but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly)
Ever so cunning
6 weeks later, jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes
You can't afford to let one in
Never done tunes for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learned and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But they forgot to tell you, you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show
Thinking ""I just wanna see my brother""
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up
[Hook]

Hi, my name is JME
There was a time when radio played me
'Cause my music came from my heart
It was real to me, but now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think
""JME just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill""
The reason I started making music is the exact same
Reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all of that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is
I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different?
Look at me, determined, man on a mission
My music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'ma do this

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I never had a playlist in my heart (Oh, woah, oh)
Now I need an A list just to chart (Oh, woah, oh)
But I've been famous from the start (Oh, woah, oh)
How am I gonna make my mark? Oh, oh

Are you gonna play me though?

I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing

Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See, I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth

But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof

Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

Little lady, your mind, you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck, you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is makin' you age
But you're a heroine for takin' the strain of bein' a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where you're from usin' MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out of the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never comin' back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time now, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Verse 3: Mikill Pane]
Little lady, you're tremblin' with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear
The meddlin' nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse callin' police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal goin' mad in the ward now
The cop is tryin' to calm you, tellin' you he won't let no one to harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?""
He's talkin' to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're havin' a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learnin' more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
He's kickin' knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, ""Where you been, bitch? I wanna know""
No prizes for guessin' who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's somethin' new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
And we're all under the upper hand
And goin' mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
And fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
And angels to die17Embed"

I'm in so deep
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill
Keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow
And I'm parro, running out of ammo
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow
The less then the better
More proof for the last one left
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever?
How can I be at my best with this pressure?
I've got a lot to lose
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave
And invited more than a hundred guests
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence
It's easier when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back
Back to 15, [?]
I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat

You won't drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out

[Verse 2: Ghetts]
You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking?
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin when it's in motion
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken?
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you
Arm for arm, eye for eye
I just want to live my life
But they don't want to see this guy survive

They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's ever been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in

Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know, hmm

[Verse 1: Dot Rotten]
I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you

And of the pieces of my soul

You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one

And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh

[Verse 2: Dot Rotten]
I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?""
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you
[Hook 1]
And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran]
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you

[Verse 4: Dot Rotten]
There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me
[Hook 2: Ed Sheeran]
I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
[Verse 3]
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""Re: Stacks"" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watchin' a DVD, smokin' illegal weed
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

And every weekend in the winter, you'll be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watchin' Blue Planet, creatin' new habits
Actin' as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be takin' a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
[Bridge]
Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina

(But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)

Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know

Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?

I love your hair like that

And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear

Cold as stone in the kitchen light

Tie both shoe laces, and hope that

Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waitin' for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But **** it
I won't be changin' the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothin', I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is, you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married, then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Recently, I'll tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to ""Holocene""
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to Uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad
And he told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore

[Verse 3]
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writin' a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral
And it's just hidin' my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writin' my will before I'm twenty-seven, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no

Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm

And now you're lyin' in the bed again

With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing
[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 4: Ed Sheeran]
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check

On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey

And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight?

It never works out anyway

[Verse 2]
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth
[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won't you let me know?
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here, so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Sing!
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I need you, darling

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
[Verse 3]
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""Re: Stacks"" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watchin' a DVD, smokin' illegal weed
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

And every weekend in the winter, you'll be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watchin' Blue Planet, creatin' new habits
Actin' as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be takin' a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
[Bridge]
Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)

(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina

'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina

Lovin' can hurt

But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

As if no one knows anything but us

Cold as stone in the kitchen light

Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waitin' for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But **** it
I won't be changin' the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothin', I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is, you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married, then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

I don't want you, no

[Verse 2]
Recently, I'll tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to ""Holocene""
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to Uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad
And he told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore

[Verse 3]
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writin' a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral
And it's just hidin' my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writin' my will before I'm twenty-seven, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no

Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm

I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spittin' quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me rippin' the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew, but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now, it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoidin' the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years, I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleepin' at a subway station
To sleepin' with a movie star and addin' to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now

[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again, that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whisperin', ""Everything that happens is from now on""
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still, they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then, I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rappin' a habit and keep on fashionin' magic
I'm battlin' for respect and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet
I'll take it back now

[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
I'll take it back now
[Verse 3]
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Puttin' on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considerin' a name change, thinkin' it was hopeless
Rhymin' over recordings, avoidin' tradition
'Cause every day, some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now, absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, livin' life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowin' up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screamin' out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achievin' life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never havin' a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Havin' a pint with McDaid, discussin' records we made
And, every single second, knowin' that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, rememberin' our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now
[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us

Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And I see fire hollowin' souls

And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out

It's just another night and I'm starin' at the moon
I saw a shootin' star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?

[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

[Verse 2]
I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playin' ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love

So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beatin' to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
[Verse 3]
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""Re: Stacks"" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watchin' a DVD, smokin' illegal weed
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

And every weekend in the winter, you'll be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watchin' Blue Planet, creatin' new habits
Actin' as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be takin' a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again

[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina

Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""275Embed"

Mmm

[Verse 1]
I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

[Chorus]
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

I've been lookin' for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
I'm so in love

[Verse 2]
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear

I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

[Pre-Chorus]
""How long you leaving?""
Well, Dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own

[Verse 2]
I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go

As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love

Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now, I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder

Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waitin' for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But **** it
I won't be changin' the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothin', I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is, you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married, then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

[Verse 2]
Recently, I'll tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to ""Holocene""
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to Uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad
And he told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no

[Verse 3]
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writin' a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral
And it's just hidin' my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writin' my will before I'm twenty-seven, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no

I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

Come on, set the tone

Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!

Now I'm in town, break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night
In front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao
Seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true
My songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue
I stick to other artists
I'm not you
No, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing
And move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, It's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put
Give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

You need me, man, I don't need you, at all

[Verse 2]
I sing, I write my own tunes
And I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith
To make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer writer
You're just bluffing
Name's on the credits
And you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
Young singer/writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
[Chorus]
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

[Bridge]
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning out
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning on a spliff of your high-grade
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning burning burning

[Verse 4]
Now, where I come burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high-grade weed you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I say where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yeah do da burn up the place up in the hood
One of the things that I've inherited
Like a ghetto man you should
One of the things is smoking weed
Yes it makes me feel good
But high-grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
Mommy, yes I'm gonna table sensimilla is a drug
And If I start to smoke I'm gonna turn into a thug
Where I come from all that talking
It could only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed
It is a blessing from above
Where I come from, yes we burn it
When we listen rob a dove
Where I come from, yes we burn it
After we dash to make love
Where I come from, yes we burn it
When the sun does shine
I blaze high-grade weed all the time

[Chorus]
Now, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Yeah

[Verse 5]
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, Now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height, and I'm going hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter
Yeah, the game's over, but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track, without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch
So, you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow
From day one I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa
Giving a dose of what the future holds-
Cos it's another day close, close, close, close brrrrr
I've still got a rucksack for the old clothes
I rap with the cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes
In fact, you don't know
On tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
Man, flows developing
Skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team
I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women
And then I packaged the image
Put in some content
And then I throw it back as a gimmick
The fact is this
I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses
I think I need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders
I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard part's sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping back to back
Cause I've been practising
I'm back to sing this, yes

[Chorus]
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man

[Verse 6]
I'll keep my last name forever
Keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tune
When I chase it
And replace it with an elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes, using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack
Aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack
Aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack
Still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But, more people hear me, though
According to the Myspace and Youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, If I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming
Like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Sing!Embed"

We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?
And heaven knows, no one wants it to

[Pre-Chorus]
So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

[Chorus 1]
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

[Verse 2]
We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through

[Pre-Chorus]
So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

No, my friends won't love me like you

[Bridge]
But then again, if we're not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why

[Chorus 2]
Friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you do
Oh, my friends will never love me like you27Embed"

No, I just wanna hold ya

[Verse 2: Mic Righteous]
As youths we used to play games
Like hide and seek and Simon Says
And then we realized we’re not mice, we’re men
And that was kinda dead
For one more time, let’s play Simon Says
But this time, it’s not Simon, ‘cause Simon’s Ed
Give me love like it meant life or death
Like it meant your final breath, yeah
Give me love like you could buy it from the corner shop
You could spend your time, so it don’t matter if you’re poor or not
Give me that real love, something you could feel, love
Maybe it could heal ya, just like the first time you said it
Give me love cause hate is the worst kind of weapon
It’s like I finally see the person in my reflection

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow)
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
Whenever I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
Young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all

You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you at all

[Verse 3]
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
I made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
Then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady

[Pre-Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy, I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, got a bottle full of bubbly
Mummy, I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't, sing it out
You need me, man, I don't, scream it
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't

[Bridge]
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning, burning, burning

[Verse 4]
Now where I come from, burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
'Cause if I don't have it in my pocket, I'm going to panic
'Cause like I said where I come from, weed smoking is a habit
We'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'm gonna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from, burning weed, it is a blessing from above
Where I come from, yes, we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from, yes, we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from, yes, we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time

[Verse 5]
Welcome to Jamrock, camp whe' the thugs dem camp at
Two pound a weed inna van back
It inna yuh hand bag, yuh nap sack, it inna yuh back pack
And ah give yah girlfriend contact
Some bwoy nuh know dis, dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And they don't know the real hardcore
'Cause Sandals ah no ""Back-To,"" thugs dem wi' do whe' dem got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't mek dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
And dem don't stand a chance at all, now my eyes are red

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you

Woah, woah, hey (Woah)

[Verse 5]
'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
'Cause I'm young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' 'em out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Close, close, close, close

[Verse 6]
I've still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with the cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact, you don't know
Tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
You can't keep up, you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
'Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with ""The A Team"" I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then packaged the image
Put in some content, then sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back 'cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this, yes

[Chorus]
You need me, man, sing it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, scream it
You need
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't
Devlin

[Verse 7: Devlin]
Yo, yo, you need me, but I dont need you
D-E-V-L-I-N, Ed and 32
I'm lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I ain't gotta amputate a lower limb to make you fall
Like autumn, check the post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for his fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
And now the clock's aviated and everybody's time's up
Nothing's what I had and everything is what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line, fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
'Cause I get respected while they get detested
Told the truth, there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition, just a fish, you're tryna bite a line

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Sway]
Sing it, you need me, man, I don't
Make some noise for Devlin
Sing it, you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, scream it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you (Yeah)
Sway

[Verse 8: Sway]
All over the radio and back up in the raves again
We got the crowd on the wave like it's a stadium
Call me the weather man, it's 'bout to be a great weekend
I'm on the cloud, let's make it rain again
Nice but naughty, shirts and dresses looking saucy
Living in our minuses 'cause life begins at forty, level up
Call me Bond, James Bond
How I maintain, winner stays on
My brain racing like I'm tryna win the gold for Britain
I'm on a one-track mind, let's go the distance
We're only stopping when we pose for pictures
And now we move so wavy, we get motion sickness
I choose if you're hearing
Sway started rapping, now you're fearing
Hands in the air, start screaming
I say Ed, you say— peace, yeah

[Chorus]
You need me, man, I don't
Make some noise for Sway and keep singing that hook, it goes
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, sing it out, sing it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't
Chip

[Verse 9: Chip]
Ayy
It's funny how money change the situations
And miscommunication leads to complications
Shouts to Meek Mills when your dream chasing
The people at the back love confrontation
Finsy Park to Tottenham Hale were my stations
Me, Twiss, and Dredd used to bump the train
No Victoria line, me I made a lane
Take notes from my career and them keep the
These kids can't test me, I'm on my grown
Still with Sammy, I ain't on my own
If I wear red bottoms you won't even know
'Cause you won't catch me in pictures tryna show my soles
CMAR, we come and done the place
Ice ever melts, man a flood the place
Red, white, and blue diamonds, me and Wretch are the same
And yeah, we in the same chamber, but ain't the same chain

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Chip]
You need me, man, I don't
Make some noise everybody (Give it up for Ed Sheeran)
You need me, man, I don't
One more time, make some noise for Chip
Say, you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, scream it out, scream it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

[Verse 10: Wretch 32, Wretch 32 & Ed Sheeran, Ed Sheeran]
You need three, man, I don't need two
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own lane like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
Qualified for everything, long straight season
Not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic, MC dinner time
I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
Didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit, but I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my palm, I'ma smash it

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Wretch 32]
You need me, man, I don't
Make some noise for Wretch 32 (Ed Sheeran)
You need me, man, sing it out (Ah yeah)
You need me, man, scream it
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, now everybody go

[Interlude]
Oh, oh, oh
Go oh, oh, oh
Go oh
Go oh
Go woo
Go woo-ah

Right, so this is the point in the gig where we change a little bit
One more time, make some noise for my beautiful guests
Devlin, Sway, Chip, Wretch 32
This is where we change it, right
At the beginning, you were the gospel choir
Now you're in competition with each other
You are split down the middle
This side, all along the back into the middle, up top, you are one side
This side, all along the front into the middle, up top, you are one side
To make this a little more interesting, we're gonna use some roleplay
There's a film called West Side Story
In West Side Story, you have two rival gangs
Jets and Sharks, and they don't get on
And they come to a final battle with guns, knives, and bats
They're running towards each other, running, running, ah
Stop, sing
This is how it's gonna work, each side, you are one gang each
We're gonna use volume, not violence
Right, all along the front to the back into the middle of this side, up top, you guys are the Jets
All along the front, right 'round to the back into the middle, up top of this side, you guys are the Sharks
Jets, give me a ""Hell yeah""
Sharks, give me a ""Woop, woop""
Jets, give me a ""Wow""
Sharks, give me a ""Hell yeah""
Right, this is how it's gonna work
Each side, you get one thing to sing
Jets, you're gonna be ""You need me""
Sharks, you're gonna be ""My eyes are red""
The trick is this is not a singing thing, this is a volume thing
However loud you scream, you win
Jets and Sharks, ""You need me, my eyes are red, it goes like this
Scream it out as loud as you can, Jets first, then Sharks

You need me, man, I don't, scream it out
You need me, man, scream it
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, keep it goin'
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, Sharks, here we go
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, now scream it out, scream it
My eyes are red

You need me (Man, I don't need you)
(You need me, man, my eyes are red)
(You need me, man, I don't need you)
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red

Okay, we're gonna change the competition now
To a KRS-One tune called ""The Sound of the Police""
Each side gets one thing to sing
We're gonna start off as quietly as possible
Then get as loud as we can, like this

Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the beast, sing
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
(Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police)
(Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police)
(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the beast, sing
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the beast
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound, everybody go

Oh, oh, oh
Go oh, oh, oh
Go you need me, man, I don't need you
Go you need me, man, I don't need you
Go you need me, man, I don't need you
Go you need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man

[Verse 11]
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
Replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes, using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack, aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack, aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, I still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Primark tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, scream it out
You need me, man, I don't, sing it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, scream it
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, take it up one more and go
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need youEmbed"
