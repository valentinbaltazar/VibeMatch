Welcome, cosmic brothers and sisters of Maui to the Rainbow Bridge laboratory color sound experiment
We're here for a very, very particular purpose
I think it applies
To all our brothers and sisters all across the planet
Rainbow Bridge is not just a bridge
It's something we all hope to walk across today
And have Jimi lead us across today
Just as there are cells that make up our body
We are cells in the body of the planetary being
And the purpose of humanity, for bеing on this planet
In the great cosmos, in thе multi-universes
The reason for being here is to build that bridge
Between the heart and the higher, middle spiritual centers of the planetary being
And every higher thought, and every higher action
That each of us participate in
Builds that bridge
So we all know about the vibration on the side of the crater, here
And we'd like to–
And the reason that we've–
That we've all kinda dropped out to here
And it's the first time that anybody's dropped out in large numbers since the Christians dropped out of Rome
Then, we want to convey that bond to everyone else
Instead of just kinda being a receptive, groovy audience and have what we have at every lovely concert, forever and ever, up to now
If we just met–
Turn on our energies so that Jimi can pick into that
And lead us across that bridge
And everybody across the world is gonna pick up on that
So, we're all counting on you
And here's your chance
And Jimi should be here in a few minutesEmbed"

Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger, she drinks her blood from a jagged edge
(Drink up, baby)
Been riding broomsticks since she was fifteen
Blow out all the other witches on the scene
She got a bull whip, just as long as your life
Her tongue can even scratch the soul out of the devil's wife
Well, I seen her in action at the players' choice
Turning all the love men into donut boys
Hey rеd hot momma, you'd better step asidе
This chick's gonna turn you to a block of ice
Look out

[Verse 2]
Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so strong gonna make you stagger, baby
Dolly Dagger
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge
Right on
Drink up baby
Hey!

Yeah, look at old burnt out Superman
Tryin' to shoot his dust on the sun

On the words of love
Do they ever touch Dolly Brown
Better get in some highway and clear outta town
Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger
She ain't satisfied 'til she gets what she's after
She drinks the blood from the jagged edge
Better watch out, baby, here comes your master
Alright
Watch out there, baby
Gonna give a little bit of thatEmbed"

Riding down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Trying to find his heaven above
But he is dying to be loved

He's telling me living
Is so magic
Something is forever
So he claims
He’s talking bout lying
It is so tragic, baby
But don't you worry about today
We got freedom coming our way

How long
Do you think
He's going to last
Carrying out on a gas [?]

See all the others say
Do what you please
Got to get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey motorcycle mama

Something is forever
So he claims
He's talking bout lying
It is so tragic, baby
But don't you worry about today
We got freedom coming our way

How long
Do you think
He's going to last
Carrying out on a gas [?]

See all the others say
Do what you please
Got to get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust

Reaching up but not quite touching the promised land

Saying Lord, please, send us a helping hand

Got them earth blues today

[Verse 2: Jimi Hendrix]

Sirens clashing with black earth and rocking stone
I think you better love me now, darling, it just might be too latе after a while
And tell our child to bury old daddy's brokеn clothes

I send a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart, baby
Come on along with me today

Find yourself first
And-a then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool baby
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come on along with me
Don't mess with your man
He'll never understand

Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
And then prove to the man

Well, I'm a man
At least, I'm trying to be
But I've learned before
That other half of me
I said, I'm a man
Look across the deep blue sea
But I ain't gonna search
For nothing desperately
Hey, I'm trying, trying
Trying to keep my cool
Well, I'm trying to keep my gloom
Yea, yea, yea
Well, until I find that sweet love of mine
I'm just a rolling
Screaming, tumbling
Crying, girly loving, rolling stone

[Verse 2]
Hey, if you're a woman
At least, you say you are
You're a woman
At least, you look like you are
You're a woman
At least, you say you are
But you make it off, in bed with my guitar
And you leave the real me outside
To leave out, 'round the nighttime
You say you just want a ticket to ride
You don't give a damn about-

You're just a screaming
Didn't love 'ya sometimes
But a, rolling, tumbling, stepping, stepping stone
That's all you-

I see hands, and I see tear-stained faces
Reaching up but not quite touching on promised land
I see [?] and a whole lotta tears wasted
Saying, ""Please, send us a helping hand, oh Lord""

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Just happy to hear some changes
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Know it's about that time to find it
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, freedom's ever marching to me
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Keep everybody alright

[Verse 2: Jimi Hendrix]
I hear the sound of freedom's marching drum
You and I be there, young and old
You better love me now like it's gonna be the last time, darling
And tell our child you'll sell daddy's broken clothes

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Up there stands a woman, baby
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
And I feel her burning light on mе
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Could this be God's answer?
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
It'd sure hеlp me

Well, I see hands, and I see tear-stained faces
Reaching up but not quite touching the promised land
Well, I taste tears and the precious years wasted
Saying Lord, please, send us a helping hand

On the mountain stands a woman

Hey, I feel her shining light
(Lord, Lord, Lord)

Thank you, Lord, and keep her alright

I hear the thunder of freedom's beating heart
Sirens clashing with black earth and rocking stone
I think you better love me now, darling, it just might be too late after a while
And tell our child to bury old daddy's broken clothes

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]

Hey, I see a beautiful woman

Oh uh
I see fingers, hands, and shades of faces
Reaching up and not quite touching the promised land
I hear pleas, and prayers, and a desperate whisper saying:
""Oh Lord, please give us a helping hand""
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Way down in the background
I can see frustrated souls of cities burning
And all across the water vapor
I see weapons barking out the stamp of death
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFO's jumping themselves
Laughing they saying
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess

[Verse 3]
Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink
I can't really tell my feet from the sawdust on the floor
But as far as I know
They may even try to wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me
Brother sell me, and don't worry about looking at the storm

And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary

[Verse 3]
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life they lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last

Green light, Seven Eleven
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
You don't smoke, don't even want to
Hey now, check your change
Dressed up like a car crash
Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive

[Verse 2]
Oh, is that what it is?
Red lights, grey morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip synch. to the talk shows
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

[Chorus]
If I could stay, then thе night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust

Told mе stand up and say what was on my mind

Do wе go along with something?
With some of the things we know
Ain't right?
Have to be wrong
Sometimes I feel, yeah
Oh, I feel so disappointed
Every little thing that I try
Looks like turns out to be in vain
And I turn around and look at my friends
And ask them for some kind of understanding
And they said ""Oh look at me, don't look at me""
Ooh, how they changed
So tell me, who?
Tell me who do I turn to?
Where?
Where can I go?
Who has the answer?
Seems that don't know, don't know

Send for all your absent lover's things
Sheepish wolves looking lived in eating buttons
Wink, just don't put your teeth on me

Accidents let the evening in the back door
Filled the room ceiling to the floor
Beat backbones, grazed the poem and made it strange
I wasn't born to be a skeleton

Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world beforе it happens

Jealous orchard the sky is falling off thе ceiling
While I'm tucking fibs into a cookie jar
Reverie it's useless searching in the cupboards
When everything you have is on your back

Is that the stars in the sky, or is it
Rain falling down
Will it burn me if I touch the sun, yeah
So big, so round
Would I be truthful, yeah, in
Choosing you as the one for me?
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Verse 2]
My mind is so messed up
Going round and round
Must there be all these colours
Without names, without sound, baby?
My heart burns with feeling, but
Whoa my mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh my head is pounding, pounding
Going round and round and round and round
Must there always be these colours
Without names, without sound?

Oh but my mind, it's cold and reeling

Down the street you can hear her scream ""You're a disgrace""
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries ""Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?""
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

[Chorus]
And so castles made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually

[Verse 2]
A little Indian brave who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle
But something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

'Cause she was crippled for life and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop living
So she decided to die

And to her legs she smiled, ""You won't hurt me no more""
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
""Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way""
And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going

Before I could ask ""Was it the East or West side?""
My feet they howled in pain
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep
But not as deep in my mind as the rain
As they pulled away, I could see her words
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent
I picked them up, brushed them off
To see what they said
And you wouldn't believe
""Come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle
And bring along the bottle and a president""

[Chorus]
And eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him
(Gets very lonely up this road, baby)
(Yeah, hmmm, yeah)
(Got more to say)

[Verse 2]
Well I'm riding through LA (huh)
On a bicycle built for a fool
And I seen one of my old buddies
And he say, ""You don't look the way you usually do""
I say, ""Well, some people look like a coin-box""
He says, ""Looks like you have got no coins to spare""
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone
And combed this breath right out of my hair

And I'm on my way straight home to you
But I feel so dizzy, I take a quick look in the mirror
To make sure my friend's here with me too
And you know good well I don't drink coffee
So you fill my cup full of sand
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
Cherry lipstick around the broken edge
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
And your cat he attacks me from his pill-box ledge
And I thought you were my friend too
Man, my shadow comes in line before you

[Verse 1]
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side""

[Verse 2]
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
""Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise""
And then she took me high over yonder
You might also like[Chorus]
And I said, ""Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side""

I told you man was here to love but he had to go
So you killed Jesus
You killed Abraham, too
You killed Martin
What you here to do
Now we're gonna play you the feelings
That they all left behind
Oh, you make it hurt so bad

Take everything I had

Lord, I feel the ocean swaying me
Washing away all my pain
See where I used to be wounded
Remember the scar?
Now you can't see a thing
And I don't feel no pain, no, no

[Chorus-Jimi Hendrix]
Singing about the Valleys of Sunrise
Green and blue canyons, too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is rising, rising, rising

[Verse 2-Jimi Hendrix]
Mercury liquid, emerald's shining
Now showing me where I came from, baby
Honey sun, turquoise bed he lays in
On the burning edge horizon
I'm sailing on a bluebird's mission
Bubbles and curls and tiptoes in the foam
See the wind make love to all the ocean
Tidal waves spread, and the message got home
And the message got home

[Chorus-Jimi Hendrix]
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets...
Purple and gold... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising -

Look out east coast, but you're going to have a neighbor
A rebirth land, home of the praying hands​
We know there were kinds, so much older
And they shall rise, and tell us much more the truth of man
I see visions of sleeping peaks erupting
Releasing all hell that will shake the Earth from end to end

[Outro-Jimi Hendrix]
And this isn't bad news, good news, or any news
It's just the truth, better save your souls while you can

Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide...

Crackle, crackle

Wow! Look over yonder, this is the end
He's just now saying he wants to be my friend
When he's around, I can't do nothing right
He's got me wearing shades in the middle of the night
Look over yonder, yeah

And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life they lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you, got to realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And he says, “Hey baby would you like to uh, a make a deal?""

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel? Baby!
How does it feel?
To be on your own?
With no direction home?
A complete unknown?
Look at ya...Like a rolling stone?
[Verse 3 and Chorus 3 were accidentally skipped by Jimi and he admits it in Verse 4]

[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made, yeah
Exchangin' all precious gifts and things
But you'd better take your diamond ring, I think ya better pawn it, babe
Yeah I know I missed a verse; don't worry
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 4]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel, baby?
To be on your own?
With no direction home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?Embed"

Just take all your blues
And throw them at my feet

1
I feel the ocean swaying me ...
Washing away all my pains
See where I was wounded
Remember the scar ?
Now you can't see a thing ...
And I feel no pain --

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets
Green and blue ... Canyons too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

2

Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining
Telling me where I came from --
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he
Lays in -- ... on the Burning
Edge Horizon

I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ...
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam --
See the wind make love to all
The ocean ... Joy spread and
The massage got home --
You might also likeSinging about the Valley of Sunsets ...
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising --

3

Look out East coast, but you're
Gonna have a neighbor
A rebirth land ...
The praying Burning Sands

We know there were worlds
So much older ...
And they shall rise, and
Tell us much more the truth of man --

4

I see visions of sleeping peaks
Erupting ...
Releasing all hell that
Will shake the Earth from end to end --
And this ain't bad news, good news
Or any news ... it's just the truth
Better save your souls while
You can --
Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be ...

1
I feel the ocean swaying me ...
Washing away all my pains
See where I was wounded
Remember the scar ?
Now you can't see a thing ...
And I feel no pain --

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets
Green and blue ... Canyons too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

2

Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining
Telling me where I came from --
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he
Lays in -- ... on the Burning
Edge Horizon

I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ...
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam --
See the wind make love to all
The ocean ... Joy spread and
The massage got home --
You might also likeSinging about the Valley of Sunsets ...
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising --

3

Look out East coast, but you're
Gonna have a neighbor
A rebirth land ...
The praying Burning Sands

We know there were worlds
So much older ...
And they shall rise, and
Tell us much more the truth of man --

4

I see visions of sleeping peaks
Erupting ...
Releasing all hell that
Will shake the Earth from end to end --
And this ain't bad news, good news
Or any news ... it's just the truth
Better save your souls while
You can --
Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be ...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arisingEmbed"

Lord, I had a woman
Lord knows she was good to me in every way
Yes, I had a woman
A real woman

Lord, she gave me love both night and day
My sunshine
Whoo hoo
For my woman
Or else or else
Its going to take me one more day
If it takes me

She went way down in Dallas
Way down in Texas land
Lord, she had me wrapped around her wrist and around her finger, baby
Like a ring wrapped around a finger of a severed hand
I'm looking for my Dallas honey bee

Hello, how you doin’, England?
Glad to see ya
We'll do a thing called ""Freedom""

[Instrumental Intro]

You’ve got with my children
Screamin' at my wife
You better get outta here
One day

[Chorus]
Freedom
That's what I want now
Freedom
That's what I need now

[Chorus]
Freedom
That's what we want now
Freedom
That’s what we need now
Freedom
Gotta live
Freedom
To you, I wanna give

[Verse 3]

Or you just want to bleed me
You better sticking your dagger in someone else
So I can be free

Takes him higher
Searchin' for his heaven above
But he's dying to be loved

So he claims
He says dyin'

See all the others say

He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Trying to find his heaven above
But he is dying to be loved

He's telling me living
Is so magic
Something is forever
So he claims
He's talking bout lying
It is so tragic, baby
But don't you worry about today
We got freedom coming our way

How long
Do you think
He's going to last
Carrying out on a gas [?]

See all the others say
Do what you please
Got to get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak

Reaching up but not quite touching the promised land
Well, I taste tears and the precious years wasted
Saying Lord, please, send us a helping hand

And tell our child to bury old daddy's broken clothes

It really doesn't, it really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the, uh, ever-falling dust that makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring laying on the floor facing coldly toward the door

[Chorus]
And I continue to burn the midnight lamp all alone
Burn
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag

[Verse 3]
So here I sit to face that same old fireplace
Getting ready for the same old explosion going through my mind
And soon enough, the time will tell
About the surface in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone who will toll my bell

With a thousand smiles she gives to me free

The other half of me
I have lived before
That you don't want me
But in this search
For nothing desperately
Oh, I'm trying trying
Not to be a fool
I'm trying trying
Lord to keep my cool, baby trying so hard to keep it together

After I find, baby
That true love of mine
I am just Rolling screaming
Crying flying
Can't be trusted, got busted
Rolling stone

You are a woman
At least you say you are
You are a woman
At least you look like you are
You are a woman
At least you taste like you are
But you can take it off
In bed with my guitar
And then you leave them
Throw me outside
To cry, cry
To the moon and the nighttime
Save my soul
You cannot find
All you want is a ticket to ride
After you show me everything
It did prove otherwise

About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

And I said, ""Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side""

Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
""Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man

And then she took me high over yonder

(Is the microphone on?)

[Intro]
Hey baby where are you coming from?

[Verse 1]
Well she looked at me and smiled
And looked into space and said ""I'm coming from the land of the new rising sun""
Then I said, ""Hey baby, where are you trying to go to?""
Then she said ""I'm going to
Spin and spread around peace of mind and a whole lot of love to you and yours""

[Chorus]
Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along

[Verse 2]
""Would you like to come along?"" She asked me
""Yes, take me along right now""
Hey baby, can I step into your world for a while?

""Yes you can,"" she said
Come on back with me for a while
We're going to go across the Jupiter sand and see all you people one by one
We got to help you people out right now
That's why I'm doing it all about

Yeah, his guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots is his Cadillac
Flamin' hair just a blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin

He left home when he was seventeen
The rest of the world he had longed to see
But everybody knows the boss
A rolling stone who gathers no moss

But you'd probably call him a tramp
But it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now some people say he had a girl back home
Who messed around and did him pretty wrong
They tell me it kinda hurt him bad
Kinda made him feel pretty sad

I couldn't say what went through his mind
Anyway, he left the world behind
But everybody knows the same old story

The morning is dead, and the day is too
There's nothing left here to lead me but the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's a little more than enough to make a man throw himself away

[Refrain]
And I continue to burn the  midnight lamp alone

[Verse 2]
Now the smiling portrait of you is still hanging on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, it really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the, uh, ever-falling dust that makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring laying on the floor facing coldly toward the door

[Chorus]
And I continue to burn the midnight lamp all alone
Burn
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag

[Verse 3]
So here I sit to face that same old fireplace
Getting ready for the same old explosion going through my mind
And soon enough, the time will tell
About the surface in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone who will toll my bell

Little Miss Lover
Where have you been in this world for so long?
Well, I love a lover
That feels like you, would you like to tag along?
Well, I really don't need any help little girl
But I think you could help me out anyway
Aw, sucker today

[Verse 2]
Would you believe baby
I've been looking for a soul that feels like you
For some time
Excuse me while I see
If the gypsy in me is right
If you don't mind
Well, he signals me ok
So I think it's safe to say
I'm going to make a play
Aw, yeah

And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street

Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary

And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life they lived is dead

The names it has blown in the past?
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom

Anger, he smiles
Towering in shiny metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on

But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

[Verse 2]
My red is so confident he flashes trophies of war And ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go 'round
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all of these emotions of mine keeps holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

But I'm uh, yeah, l'm bold as love

Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

And I said, ""Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side""

Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
""Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise""
And then she took me high over yonder

One time Noel was playing with himself
And she come knockin' on his door
And little Noel gonna take a solo on the bass, then
Showing that he appreciates her love
Even though she did look like home made sin
And her breath smelt like wet pussy
And while all that was happening
I looked out the window
And here comes the man with all the groovy grass
And here we are freakin' out man
You know we be gettin' into somethin' good
And we layin' back, freaking and smoking and joking
All a sudden, I hear the man coming
The man the cops they came in, oh, Lord, have mercy

[Chorus]
I said hey Gloria

Here's a song written by Dylan
A thing called ""Like a Rolling Stone""

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime
Oh, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware doll
You're bound to fall""
You thought they all
A-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus 1]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juicеd in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on thе street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""
You might also like[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus 3]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown

Goode - Live at Berkeley Community Theatre Lyrics[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go

And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

As the sad fisherman goes home without a hitch
But ""Hee hee hee"" says the fisherman
With his lady burning french fries in the frying pan

Look over yonder, here come the blues
The thirteenth of any time, powered by fools
I can see them coming
Wearing a blue armored coat
You're sitting here with your violins
Hitting wrong notes
Look over yonder, he's coming my way
When he's around, I never have a happy day
(You even bust my guitar strings)

[Chorus]
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder

Well, he's talking to my baby
They found my peace pipe on her
Now they're dragging her away
Lord knows we don't need a devil like him beating us around
Well, he's knocking on my door
How my house is tumbling down
Now don't you come no closer
The path is keeping me bolder
Wait by my door, baby

Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side""

[Verse 2]
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
""Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise""
And then she took me high over yonder

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side""

And my time it isn't long
And I still do not know
What is was that I've done wrong

Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
""Well, you fail to understand,"" he said
""Why must you even try?""

Inside, the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more
Cried for more, cried for more
Hey, you better leave that boy's soul alone

She walks with a bell clock round her neck
So the hippies think she's in with time, time
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck
Branches attack me from her neck

[Chorus]
She's so fine
She's so very very fine

[Verse 2]
The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind, mind
Morning sign sounds just like a lark
All these signs are always the  start

[Chorus]
She's so fine
She's so very very fine

[Bridge]
When I veer I get so near
But so far, far, far away
Listen to me today

[Outro]
We united just beside a leaf
The ground was hard underneath her
She's so fine, fineYou might also likeEmbed"

Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side""

[Verse 2]
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
""Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise""
And then she took me high over yonder

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side""

I used to live in a room full of mirrors
All I could see was me
Well, I take my spirit and I smash my mirrors
Now the whole world is here for me to see
I said the whole world is here for me to see
Now I am searching for my love to be
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Rubber glass was all in my brain
Cotton screaming crying in my head
Rubber glass was all in my brain
Just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
And just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
I said making love was strange in my bed

Her tongue can even scratch the soul out of the devil's wife

Well, I seen her in action at the players' choice
Turning all the love men into donut boys

There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Riding down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Trying to find his heaven above
But he is dying to be loved

He's telling me living
Is so magic
Something is forever
So he claims
He's talking bout lying
It is so tragic, baby
But don't you worry about today
We got freedom coming our way

How long
Do you think
He's going to last
Carrying out on a gas [?]

See all the others say
Do what you please
Got to get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey motorcycle mama
You going to marry me? haha

I sure got the blues this morning, baby
Yeah, and I'm here to tell you about it
So you might as well pick up on it
I'm a man
At least I'm trying to be
I have lived before
The other half of me
I have lived before
That you don't want me
But in this search
For nothing desperately
Oh, I'm trying trying
Not to be a fool
I'm trying trying
Lord to keep my cool, baby trying so hard to keep it together

After I find, baby
That true love of mine
I am just Rolling screaming
Crying flying
Can't be trusted, got busted
Rolling stone

You are a woman
At least you say you are
You are a woman
At least you look like you are
You are a woman
At least you taste like you are
But you can take it off
In bed with my guitar
And then you leave them
Throw me outside
To cry, cry
To the moon and the nighttime
Save my soul
You cannot find
All you want is a ticket to ride
After you show me everything
It did prove otherwise

You just rolling, screaming, crying good love is sometime
But cannot be trusted
Stepping stone

That's my drink, man, that's my drink, alright
Make it a double, or eh
Somebody has to sing
Some body will sing?
Somebody will sing, right?
I don't know""

You all pass me that bottle
And I'll sing you all a real song
Yeah
Let me get my key, ahem

Well, I'm looking through Harlem
My stomach squeal just a little more
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints
Pulls up to soap box door
Now a lady with a pearl handled necktie
Tied to the driver's fence
Breathes in my face
Bourbon and coke possessed words
""Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell
Or was it just an accident?""
(You know how I felt then, and so)

Before I could ask ""Was it the East or West side?""
My feet they howled in pain
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep
But not as deep in my mind as the rain
And as they pulled away, I could see her words
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent
Well I picked them up, brushed them off
To see what they say
And you wouldn't believe
""Come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle
And bring along the bottle and a president""

[Verse 2]
Well I'm riding through LA (huh)
On a bicycle built for a fool
And I seen one of my old buddies
And he say, ""You don't look the way you usually do""
I say, ""Well, some people look like a coin-box""
He says, ""Looks like you have got no coins to spare""
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone
And combed this breath right out of my hair

[Chorus]
And eh sometimes it's not so easy
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him
[Verse 3]
I just got out of a Scandinavian jail
And I'm on my way straight home to you
But I feel so dizzy, I take a quick look in the mirror
To make sure my friend's here with me too
And you know good well I don't drink coffee
So you fill my cup full of sand
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
Cherry lipstick around the broken edge
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
And your cat he attacks me from his pill-box ledge
And I thought you were my friend too
Man, my shadow comes in line before you

[Chorus]
I'm finding out that it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do the same just like him

Here I come to save the day

[Verse 1]
A little boy inside a dream just the other day
His mind fell out of his face, and the wind blew it away
A hand came out from Heaven and pinned a badge on his chest
It said, ""Get out there, man, and a-do your best""
Uh

[Chorus]
They call him Astro Man
And he is flying higher than
That old faggot superman
Ever could

[Verse 2]
Oh, they call him Cosmic Nut
And he's twice as dense as Donald duck
And he will try his best to screw you up
The rest of your mind

[Interlude]
Oh, look out, my guitars!

[Chorus]
Astro man
Flying across the sky
Ten times higher
Then that old faggot superman
Ever, ever could
Ever could

They were still arguin' about me then

You know they got pills for ills and thrills, and even spills
But I think you're just a little too late
So I'm comin' down into this world, daddy
Regardless of love and hate
And I'm gonna sit up in your bed, mama, huh
And just a-grin right in your face
And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates, huh

Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's about the time we'd like to present you to the electric church
And baby if you would you all listen to our notes
Here, here in our sins, playing
Instead of rapping like I am now
Then maybe I'll well maybe this is good enough
What you think we stick with songs
It's all freedom

There's a red house, over yonder baby
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder, baby
Lord, that's where my baby stays

I haven't been home to see my baby
In about a ninety-nine and one half days
It's about time to see her

Laying in the alleyway
Maybe some rich fool will come my way
And throw me a dime
Tthat's all I need to give me more wine
All I got is to my name
Is a beat up guitar with three broken strings
And I sure know I'm just ain't taking care of no business
Lookie here

Hey kitty cat! Where you going?
This part of the alley is my home
Walking all over outside my wall
Boy you sure got a whole lotta dogs
I had a sandwich in a paper bag
But a rat stole it, ain't that some drag?
Lord, I know, I know I sure ain't taking care of no business
Play the horn

Now try to give me a job
Feeding chickens and washing down hogs
But that meant standing up all the time
And standing up to me is just like dying
I'm so lazy that I, I could cry
But tears are just too lazy to fall out my eyes
Lord, lord, lord, lord, I'm so messed up, can't even take care of no business
Play it one more time

Well, my trip hasn't been a pleasant one
And my time it isn't long
And I still do not know
What is was that I've done wrong

Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
""Well, you fail to understand,"" he said
""Why must you even try?""

Inside, the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more
Cried for more, cried for more

There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
(That's alright I still got my guitar, look out now!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well I might as well go on over yondеr
Way back up on the hill
(I got something to do)
Lord, I might as well go back ovеr yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will!You might also likeEmbed"

Well she's walking, through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

[Verse 2]
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, she said, it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything, anything
Fly on, little wing

Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me! Help me!
Ah no, no

[Verse 3]
Yeah! Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

No, yeah purple haze
