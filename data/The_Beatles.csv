[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
[Verse 2]
No one, I think, is in my tree
I mean, it must be high or low
That is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is, I think it's not too bad
You might also like[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always, no, sometimes, think it's me
But you know, I know when it's a dream
I think I know, I mean—er—yes, but it's all wrong
That is, I think I disagree

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

And though she feels as if she's in a play

We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in

Never glimpse the truth—then it's far too late—when they pass away

To try our best to hold it there—with our love
With our love—we could save the world—if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself, no one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small, and life flows on within you and without you

Who gain the world and lose their soul

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on
(Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve…)
Alarm clock rings
[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
[Interlude: John Lennon]
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm cryin'

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come

You let your face grow long

They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo a'joob

Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round

[Verse 2]
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

Sees the sun going down

I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

[Verse 2]
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

[Chorus 2]
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Bridge]
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me, hey

[Bridge]
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

[Verse 3]
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late, hey

[Chorus 3]
For your sweet top lip, I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
And still, they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
[Orchestral Solo]

[Verse 4]
But still, they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door

Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

And my soul keeps singing the blues

Rocking in two by two

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day

And I hear them say

I can never win

In the state I'm in
How could she say to me

Let me hear you say

And then she said, ""It's time for bed""

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

It is being, it is being

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr]
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr]
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine

You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel
She has to hurry

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says
Her love is dead
You think she needs you

John: Paul?
George Martin: Paul?
John: Why don't you start your note before the count-in so when it comes in it'll be clear? One, two, till start then... count in from there. Just so you don't get...
George Martin: So we... we start, we start by fading up, or bringing it up?
Paul: Fade this up, you mean? Fade the organ up?
John: Not fade it up, just, play a bit...
Ringo: One, two, three, four...
John: ...before you count to three... ??? so it doesn't start off with ""Dun!"" so it's already down
Paul: So how do we get into it?
John: Just play it now...
Ringo: Well, George carries on counting when you just start on three
Paul: I know, we fade it in, you mean, after?
John: Not fade in, just bring it in from wherever it comes in and you don't get the f- you mess(?) it down
George Martin: Just switch it in so you don't get any, any of the organ starting up, that's what he means...
Paul: Where do you get that one?
Ringo: Yeah, but, if you do it before, we'll cut you- cut that bit off
Paul: I know, I don't see how you're gonna get any different sound from that
John: We can get the organ without the start of it
Paul: Why, though?
John: 'Cause it won't be turned on
Ringo: No, you only counted one
???: Buda, buda, bum...
George Harrison: A one, two, three, four!

Do you want them to use

Do you want them to use the chords without vibrato at all?
Do you want to hear it?

Can you tell the diffеrence?
Um, not much
Yes, thеre you are, you see, sounds the same
It sounded better without
Yeah, I thought it did actually
Sounds better without
Especially if we make it more marcato too
It's a slightly more [?]
Let's do it without
So you only hear the vibrato when you've got anything to say [?]
Okay
And even then unless it, unless it happens to be a long one, like for example you've obviously got to have vibrato on those [?] bits
But even on the, uh, you know, your statements, Tony, for example, or the inner parts, ""ba-da-da-da-da-dum"" keep the vibrato fairly narrow, not too wide a vibrato
That's it, that's it

Paul: Do you want to start it again, then?
John: No, you do it then; I'll just play
Paul: No, no, no
John: Because you'll never hear it with two of us
Paul: But you, you know how to sing it
Oh, yeah, ok, it's just critical mike
Can you read that?
John: Yeah, I can read it ok now, Paul!
Right!
You can play on your track and I'll play on mine

And he told me of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed into the sea
Till we found the sеa of green

Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Bridge]
I want her everywhere, and if she's bеside me
I know I need nevеr care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction

You find that all those words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, She makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel
She has to hurry, she no longer needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, You need her
And yet you don't believe her when shе says
Her love is dead
You think shе needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him

There will be times when all the things she said
Will fill your head
You won't forget her

It is knowing, it is knowing

I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Chorus]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said ""You've got the wrong location""
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away, across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai Guru Deva, Om

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 2]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on, across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind insidе a letter box
They tumblе blindly, as they make their way across the universe

Good morning

Spending someone's hard earned pay
You and me, Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

[Chorus]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2]
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

We're on our way home

That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you've always known
The many ways I've tried

To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago

Are you alright?

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you've always known
The many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me standing here
Lead me to you door

But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her—

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

We'd meet again, for I had told you

Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 2]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Chorus: George Harrison]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mh, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mh, get high with a little help from my friends
Mh, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mh, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

[Chorus: George Harrison]

The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

Things we said today

[Bridge]
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

[Verse 3]
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to

Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about

Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace

Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene

I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 1]
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with youEmbed"

She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job

RS2

[Part I: You Never Give Me Your Money]

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away

Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

Everybody is laughing
Everybody is happy

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun king

[Verse 2]
Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol

[Part III: Mean Mr. Mustard]

[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
[Verse 2]
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

[Part IV: Her Majesty]

[Verse]
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl, but she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl, but she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot, but I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl, someday I'm going to make her mine
Oh yeah, someday I'm going to make her mine

[Part V: Polythene Pam]

[Verse 1]
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes “The News of the World”
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(Yeah!) Great!
Fab!
Isn't that great?
It's real good, that
Real good
Listen to that, Mal
Oh, look out! It's-

[Part VI: She Came In Through the Bathroom Window]

[Verse 1]
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Verse 2]
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah

[Part VII: Golden Slumbers]

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse: Paul McCartney]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Part VIII: Carry That Weight]

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mum
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son
All the children sing

[Chorus: All]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

[Chorus: All]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

""Not when he looked so fierce"", his mummy butted in
""If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him""

What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I’m gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I’ll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible (Da, da, da, da)
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to, I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

[Verse 3]
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me

About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always

As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

Alright!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked

1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
The problems you sow
Are the troubles you're reaping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Chorus]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 2]
I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Chorus]
I don't know why you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
You might also like[Verse 3]
I look at the trouble
And pain that is raging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here
Doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro]
Gently weeps
Still my guitar gently weepsEmbed"

I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do

And I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt

They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
And everyone knew her as Nancy
She and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
Now, Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

Only to find Gideon's bible

To help with good Rocky's revival

Get back to where you should be

In no time at all it makes you more aware

[All]
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!)
As the slow ray round about
Deep and crisp and crispy
Brightly show the boot last night
On the mosty cruel
Henry Hall and David Lloyd
Betty Grable too

[John] Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show

[All] (whistling)

[John] This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:

Garry Crimble to you
Garry Mimble to you
Getty Bable, dear Christmas
Happy Birthday me too

[Paul] This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing

[John] Yes! Yes! Oh yes!
You might also like[Paul] Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...

[John] Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!

[Paul] ...to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...

[All] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!

[Paul] ...so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription

[John] Ja, das wird uns danke schon
Und denn gruss von even
Ja, denn gruss von even schon
Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy
Danke schon

Ja, Ringo!

Hello, Ringo here
As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups...

(Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas)

Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted
(Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas)
King Wenceslas:
Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!)
On the feast of Stephen (Hey!)
When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!)
Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!)

Hooray!

Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!)
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters
And I'd just like to say:

Brightly was the shone that night
Though the winter cruel
When a pork pie came inside
Gathering winter cruel

Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!)
Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!)
When ev'rybody picked it...

Ha, ha, ha, ha...

Oh yeah! Oh!

Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!)

(J): Once upon a time, there were two balloons called
Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
In a million years. They were together, man. Unfortunatimetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
Kept calling them one way or another (you know how it is)
But they battled on against overwhelming oddities
Including some of there beast friends. Being in love
They cloong together even more, man. But some of the
Poisoness monsters of outrated buslodedapethrowers did
Stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
The dry cleaners. Luckily, this did not kill them and
They weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
Hopefully ever after and who could blame them

Time is here again. Ain't been around since last year

Worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who
Through thick and thin, would surely like to say a word
Of greeting at this festive occasion

But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Instrumental Break and People Laughing and Applauding]

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison & Ringo Starr]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, yeahEmbed"

Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song

Picks up the letter that's lying there

How could she do this to me

May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me?

[Bridge]
Rita!

[Verse 2]
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you

Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 1]
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 2]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet The Wife

[Verse 5]
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good...

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They’d seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
You might also like[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
Four-thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

And nothing to get hung about

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Piccolo trumpet solo]

[Verse 4]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say, but it's OK

[Bridge: John Lennon]
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife
You might also like[Verse 4: John Lennon]
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's OKEmbed"

And when my mind is wandering
There I will go

Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?

Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it

You're holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)

I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Chorus]
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 2]
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Hey, hey, hey
You might also like[Chorus]
And it really doеsn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I bеlong, I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around
Who worry me and never ask me
Why they don't get past my door

[Verse 3]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah

[Outro]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will goEmbed"
