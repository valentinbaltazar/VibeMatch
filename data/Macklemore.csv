They told me that I vanished
They told me that I had it
They told me that I'm gone
I told 'em, ""Don't panic""
When you've done it this long
And you've seen magic
And you know it won't kill you
Even when the whole world doubts it
This is my moment
They can't take my talent
They can't take my stripes
They can't erase my hours
I'm from the underground, anything above ground is a mountain
I'm done tryna impress anybody, but the heavens where I'm headed
You don't get to hold on to your flowers
I am in my zone, еyes on the throne
20k deep, bеtter pull out your phones
Turnin' the arena to believers every time I hit the ceilin'
Ain't nobody ever touchin' my show
Look at where we started, look at where we got to
Almost OD'd that night in the hospital
Wasn't gonna die, more life in the arsenal
Got another shot to pull off the impossible

[Chorus: Tones and I]
There's no need to cry for me, I'm a fighter
Fighter
You can't take my voice from me, I will rise up
Rise up
So what are you waitin' for?
I ain't ready to die yet
The pain is where faith is born
Are you alive yet? Are you alive yet?
Are you alive?

On my grave, what quote will be etched in?
Never played the game to be a contestant
Never joined the league to ride benches
The wins hit different when they don't expect it
Yeah, and they ain't gotta like me
Got my own Nikes, no Nike ID
And I ain't tryin' to stunt, man
But my logo went over the Jumpman
I remember all I had was a bus pass
Sellin' CDs to make a couple of bucks back
And now I'm up in meetings and you better believe me
Now that we got the arena, The Sonics makin' a comeback
I'm not a businessman, I got children, man
I treat my city like it is my fam
'Til the residency gets a buildin' man
Think I'm playin' 'bout mayor, but that is my plan
You know what fifty thousand feels like
When you question, ""Is this real life?""
The money doesn't buy happiness, that's facts
'Til you take what you made and decide to give it back like that

[Chorus: Tones and I]
There's no need to cry for me, I'm a fighter
Fighter
You can't take my voice from me, I will rise up
Rise up
So what are you waitin' for?
I ain't ready to die yet
The pain is where faith is born
Are you alive yet? Are you alive yet?
Are you alive?
[Verse 3: Macklemore]
I was supposed to be a one hit ringer
Now I got too many rings and not enough fingers
Keep doing my thing, they keep chasin' the wave
Thinkin' that they're gonna be the one to outpace age
I must got Mick Jagger DNA
Rollin' Stone bags, pre-check, no TSA
I'll be seventy-eight, SM58 in my face
Like, ""Who wants to go next?"" Nobody's touchin' my stage
Their heads trippin' like a B-Boy head spinnin'
I bench press the industry and I deadlift it
It's been written, I've been runnin', it's been a minute
Been done it, I bet you a hundred that I've been winnin'
The Benz tinted, it's been vintage, yeah, Ben did it
The crib I live in is like Ben Stiller's
An evening at my house, a night at the museum
Trophies, plaques all over and the view's decent
At the end of the day, it's like, ""Who needs it?""
Play on, player, I gotta keep competin'
Keep dreamin', won't settle for shit
It isn't sport, it's my life, run the championship, I'm gone

[Chorus: Tones and I]
There's no need to cry for me, I'm a fighter
Fighter
You can't take my voice from me, I will rise up
Rise up
So what are you waitin' for?
I ain't ready to die yet
The pain is where faith is born
Are you alive yet? Are you alive yet?
Are you alive?

Alright, alright
Nah, nah

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I grew up, criminals were my heroes
The beanie from New Jersey Drive over my earlobes
From jump, it was always fuck cops and the bureau
Mix of Casper, Harold, Hunter, and De Niro
Now I'm with my kids and we watchin' Olaf
And I'm like, ""Damn, used to wanna be like O'Dawg""
Tuck the Deuce Deuce under the goose, boostin' y'all
Couple screws loose, cashier turns, poof, I'm gone
Seven, I heard NWA in the street
From my older neighbor who was playin' ""Fuck tha Police""
Eleven, writin' graffiti, fifteen, I'm sellin' weed
By sixteen, I had an MPC
(It was Hip Hop's fault) That I wanted to grow up
Sell drugs, smoke blunts, drink Mad Dog and fuck
Wanted a windbreaker and some Eastbay kicks
Wanted a perm like DJ Quik
My mama said, ""Ben, are you aware your hair is way too thin?""
But in my mind, I was Junior High Iceberg Slim
Feelin' fine, gettin' high, spendin' time with a bitch
Takin' Heineken sips, this is live as it gets, shit
But me, man, I wanted to be a vandal
Wanted to kick it with the people livin' in the bando
On Third and James by the fountain where they panhandle
Runnin' from the cops, pullin' scandals, those where my heroes

Before the downtown turned to a big All Saints

Posted up in front of the 7-Eleven all day

My heroes didn't look like yours, nah, nah
They didn't work a nine-to-five, they worked a five-to-four
Woke up at three and recorded more
See, my heroes died of overdoses, ridin' for the culture
Mind tied to psychosis, all the lies in show biz
My heroes shot dope and inhaled blow in their noses
Got locked up, got out, and did some more shit
I got that devil in me and a bunch of Henny with me
And we fuck up any city, heavy hitting, any innings
Steal the pancakes off your plate and then I'm robbin' you at Denny's
In a Plymouth that is tinted and the sherm has got me spinning
You don't want it with this, put the truck in his ribs
We don't fight fair, fuck that, we jump and get our licks
Reds and whites flash through the dash, hop the fence
Wake up, smoke a blunt, hit the park and do it again

Ah, nah-nah
Ah, nah-nah

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm an alley cat, some say, ""A dirty rat""
On my side, is my gat, but I'm lyin' 'bout that
Still bumpin' Buckshot, trench coat, all in matte black
Hat with the curls bangin' right out the back
Facts, I dive in, open eyelids, fuck a silence
Big pharma, rest in piss, and get the Heisman
Look in my iris, see the trips where I been
Anti pill bottle, pro psilocybin
Still buyin' bootleg Gucci from China
Donate most but still throw it on consignment
Red carpet, Jeff Goldblum's behind us
And they ain't got a clue that these ain't real diamonds
Don't turn me back to the old me
Backpack, rappin' and battlin' back in Oly
I was studyin' Tha Carter one right after '03
Marinara, brick oven on the terrace, with the goat cheese
You flatbread from Panera, don't approach me
Coasting
David Blaine on that beat, floatin'
OGs, don't make a mothafucker OD
That outfit, that's a ""No"" for me
If you gonna to do drugs, I can suggest some
But I wouldn't spend that much of your money on Codeine
I ain't judgin', enjoy your life
But that shit is killin' people and it's overpriced
Hit the club, get the bag, man, I know that's right
But let me teach you youngbloods how to hold the mic, I'm older, right?
Never had a poltergeist and still slap a rapper like a white Dolemite, ah

[Verse 2]
I black out, stage dive right into the crowd, I never tap out
And I ain't workin' for a fucking suit, so don't ask now
That's why I always speak my mind and never back down
Since Pac was behind Shock, up in the background
Shh, shh, shh, watch the cops
Started to rap because I cannot pop and lock
Went from sellin' Nicks in a knot in my sock
To sellin' out arenas where the Knicks throw up shots
Goddamn, that's a hell of a come up
European festival money, that's a hell of a summer
I remember they were sayin' I'd be a one-hit wonder
Forty platinum later, boy, they were wrong 'bout the number, nah-nah
I'm so focused, the pen is so potent
The beachfront look like I own the whole ocean
Pull up in that, skrrt, skrrt, the door opens
The mink coat, draggin' on the floor, I ain't even notice
These rappers so emotive, grown men emoji
Face cryin' all on their socials
And I ain't hatin', I guess I'm just old school
We suppress feelings and scrapped right after homeroom
Old gold, OJ, and some cold shrooms
Twenty ounce of Faygo to go with the soul food
Look what I made off of Protools
Still remind pops, ""Aw, man, yeah, I told you""
Ooh-weeEmbed"

I need two bad bitches and a bag of good weed
Need an eighty-inch screen, that's a big TV
I need Addies to stay up, I need Xannies to get sleep
God, give me drugs, all the lean that I can drink

[Verse 1]
All my haters, suck a dick, rest in peace
And to all the opposition, you can come and get me
When I finally do some good, I need everyone to see
But please, I need you to pray for me
Had two whips, put them on gold D's
Saw Lil Baby's, I went and bought three
Can't fly commercial, that shit ain't luxury
I need duffles, duffles, Louis, Gucci, and Balenci
I need shoes, shoes, all 23
Fill the closet, buy them all and I don't even wear these
I need a necklace, I need watches, I need bezels, I need wallets
Need my diamonds to be flawless, matching no canaries
I need more, more, I'll pay whatever fee
Put me on a billboard, face on every magazine
I want it all, run it up, what the fuck is wrong with me?
'Cause I got everything and I still ain't happy

[Chorus]
I got everything I need
So why am I fallin' to my knees?
I got racks on me, money ain't a thing
All I really want is to be free
Look at me, I got everything I need

I need a new girl, she gotta be a model
Or a rapper, or a actor, or a fucking TikToker
But we need to break up, we need to make it public

And I need to rent a yacht, need to go to Miami
Move to Calabasas, get a private bowling alley
And I don't even bowl, but I'ma make a statement
Fuck you mean? I'ma to say it, I need to be the favorite
Saw the NBA players, and I'm on Obama's playlist
Fuck a top five, fuck them all, yep, I'm the greatest

I wanna be seen, I wanna be loved
I wanna be felt, don't wanna be judged
I need some healing 'cause I cannot feel it
So pour up another double cup of mud
I do not know who the hell I am
Done so many drugs I lost who I was
Every person I let in my circle is secretly
Lurkin' and out for blood (Blood)
I got forty thousand tucked under my mattress
And a ratchet in case anyone'll figure out the address
Security system in my attic, starin' at it
I'm still flexin' on the 'Gram just to show 'em that I have it
That's the fuckin' price of fame, ain't never goin' backwards
But none of this is workin', where's the purpose in this palace?
Pop a Perc 30, girls twerkin', just another purchase
Spiritually sick, I didn't even know I was malnourished

[Outro]
Everything is desolate
Botox my forehead, they can't see how stressed I am
Everything I ever wanted, the trinity, money, power, respect
In the end, were the three things that led me to deathEmbed"

[Verse: Macklemore]
I wonder what celebrities will tweet ""R.I.P.""
When it's announced that I'm dead on TMZ
Bury me with a million likes
And put me in the algorithm like a million times
Across the table from my girl and don't look in her eyes
She's gotta compete with me lookin' at these other lies
Uh-oh, what I would trade for the dollar sign
Tag me so I can be happy, get a follow, guys, like and subscribe
I don't need Funk Flex to drop a bomb on this
I need some influencers on TikTok, you bitch
I made a whole ass album, I worked hard on it
Fifteen tracks, we don't last fifteen seconds
We got A.D.D and if it's passed that we exit
We just stare at memes, laugh, and we hit the next one
And our self esteem is so messed up and threatened
By other people's means and their perceived successes
The likes ain't hittin' like they used to
Textin' while I'm drivin' and I can't connect to Bluetooth
Tell me to engage, post more to get the views, dude
Keep up with the new dudes
You really need a news crew just to trend on YouTube
We're obsessed with our public image
More than stayin' connected to our fuckin' spirit
And if you listen nowadays, you can fuckin' hear it
Same drums, same melodies, and fuck the lyrics

So call me in the mornin' when the light wakes up
Let me know I'm alright
My million mile an hour mind, let's my insecurities drive
So call me in the mornin' when the light wakes up
Let me know I'm alright

[Verse: Macklemore]
Been tryna fill that void
I been tryna purchase joy
I been tryna fill the space inside, quiet the noise
My friends dyin' off those opioids
So say a couple Hail Marys for my friends
The ones reachin' for Heaven but who never got in
I wake up and say a couple prayers under my breath
And then I get on my phone and check all my DMs
Like, ""What kind of life is this?""
Lookin' up the ladder and I'm wonderin' how high it is
If I only had this and that I'd be alright again
Social status and all of the power in the fight against
Feelin' like my life ain't shit
Lookin' in the mirror, like, ""What happened to us?""
Got distracted, acting like, maybe I could buy love
The lies the mind weaves as we run through the mud
Thinking that who I am today isn't enough, fill the void
[Chorus: Jackson Lee Morgan]
It's gettin' darker outside, these insomnia nights
So call me in the mornin' when the light wakes up
Let me know I'm alright
My million mile an hour mind, let's my insecurities drive
So call me in the mornin' when the light wakes up

Feel like I'm running out of time and the sun won't shine forever, forever
I got my mind on my money and my money, man, fuck it, whatever, whatever
Sometimes I wake up on the wrong side, I don't even feel like gettin' up
But this depression on my brain, hope it change, but the rain ain't lettin' up

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can't call it, don't know where my head is
Reflectin' on Malcolm and the shit I thought, but never said it
To Peter, Robin, to Kevin, all my other friendships
That could havе, would have, should have, and then thеy ended
I isolate between happiness and hopeless
Know what makes it worse? Still wanna get loaded
Sometimes I feel like I can't control my choices
And something takes over and I can't turn off the voices
Sittin' with these thoughts, can't escape 'em, can't run
Got some bullets in the dresser as I polish my gun
They say a day clean is a day won
But I'm holdin' on, prayin' to a god abandoned
Zonin' on the couch, starin' at my daughters
Know there's a pill in this house that I'm obsessin' about poppin'
Reservations talkin', the push and pull of the conscience
Should probably pick up the phone and call my sponsor, but don't wanna
When the Percs don't work, Xannies won't calm me down
Not enough liquor in the bar, weed growin' in the ground
Trapped by these walls where my brain can't get out
Wonderin' if my mama have to put her son in the ground

I don't know what to say, I got nothin' to write down
On my knees questioning God like, ""Why now?""

I love my life, I got concerns
I've been through Hell on some FML
It's just as well, I might lose it

I might be broken, I need repair
Don't got the answers, think I'm confused
I asked myself, ""Who are you?""

[Verse 2: NLE Choppa]
I need you right now Mack to wake up more than ever
Ain't no more weed, alcohol, and poppin' pills, et cetera
I know these days gettin' rough, but they get better
It's a cold world, let's go to the Gucci store for a sweater
Feel it deeply in my heart you need this letter
So I pour my feelings out to you before I go and mail it ('Fore I mail it)
I don't know what I'm sensin', but I can smell it
When you write me back, just tell it, I'ma soak it up, inhale it (Inhale it)
Heard you got a daughter, well, I got one too
And she too beautiful, barely see her too (See her too)
Do you hug her and tie her shoes?
Is she reflectin' of you and got a smile that bloom? (Bloom)
Before you load that gun and shoot

I would write more, but my day about to break
We can meet up face-to-face, just let me know if that's okay

Tears
Girl, dry the tears from your eyes

[Verse 1]
It's like
I met you at my parent's house when I was fourteen
Seen you my whole life but never got to me
You'd always post in the kitchen, I knew the shelf you lived in
Above where the fridge is, but we never kicked it
Finally I decided to pull you down
Had Pac in the background, pulled the shot glasses out
Grabbed you by your neck even though we just met
Hеld you close, felt the firе burn my throat
Warmth like the Holy Ghost
I remember thinkin', ""Is this real life?""
I had two and wondered what four more would feel like
Predisposed to having an obsession
Codependent before we even had a friendship
Had a dozen of you, already loved you, I couldn't stop
Got on the metro stumbling to third and Pine block
Hit the Micky D's, puked all over the restaurant
Our first date was already runnin' from the cops, like

[Chorus]
I ride with you, lie for you
My tried and true, love I never knew, uh
It kills me to think of a life without you
But sometimes I wonder if you want me to die too

In highschool our relationship was abusive
Addicted to bein' together, couldn't control my usage
We pass out together on a stranger's lawn
Woke up in a random car too gone to make it to my own prom
But I had to have you even though we'd pass out in bathrooms
Take a month off to show myself, I know myself, don't need no help
Forget the pain, pourin' rain, brown bag full of guilt and shame
Mistress controllin' my head
Getting arrested, not rememberin' anything that I said
And I knew then that I should've left
And I could see if I didn't leave, you'd lead me to death but

I ride with you, lie for you
My tried and true, love I never knew, uh
It kills me to think of a life without you
But sometimes I wonder if you want me to die too

[Verse 3]
Bitch, you killed my uncle, you're fuckin' trouble
Socially acceptable and oh, so subtle
You ruined my life and I fucking loved you
Promised relief and left me with a rusty shovel and some busted rubble
Pieces of my life that you destroyed was once freedom and joy
Was now depression, bein' unemployed
And I knew I had to change it and face it
And checked into rehab and twenty-eight days later I remembered who I really was
I remembered where I'm really from
I remembered the beauty of the present moment
That you only get when you connect to the Creator
And the breath inside the chest that fully fills your lungs
I found the people with the same allergy
And what I thought was love was really just my disease
I always thought the problem was you and couldn't believe
When I learned that the whole time my issue was me
[Chorus]
I ride with you, lie for you
My tried and true, love I never knew, uh
It kills me to think of a life without you
But sometimes I wonder if you want me to die too
I ride with you, lie for you
My tried and true, love I never knew
It kills me to think of a life without you
But sometimes I wonder if you want me to die tooEmbed"

But I'm stuck in the sandtraps
And I thought that I was past that
My eyelids live in a flashback
And I can't heal your trauma

But am I the type
The type of man that I want for my daughters
Don't lose me now
Hold my hand like the first time outside my house
When life was just a couple miles
Me and you the world was ours
I never meant to steal your smile
Fill your heart with fear and doubt
I rerun those empty vows
I play the tape and I watch for hours

Never turn my back on my birthplace
Leave it to my city, makin' sure that the dirt's straight
Leave my kids just enough 'cause I'll fail them the worst way
If I raised some rich spoiled white girls in the first place, yeah
Leave a legacy, one worth rememberin'
In my robe, lookin' out on Rome, on the Mezzanine, like
Why creators are the last ones with some equity?
Put myself in a position to pass it to my people
And that's why I'm nеver settlin', more capital than Bеverly
Before my grandma died, she saw me on Jeopardy
Still think PJs are too expensive
Still don't make music with people I ain't friends with
Still fuck the industry, and no, I don't mess with
People that my mama wouldn't want to have for breakfast
That's right, the suits, the streams, the snakes, the schemes, the steady
Pursuit of paper over truth and dreams
Loyal to my soil, never change the oil
Kept the motor runnin', kept my foot up on the gas and push to start the button
Everything I thought I always wanted, everything it wasn't
Never know that God is everything until you lose sight of Him, yeah
Never know that God is everything until you lose sight of Him

[Chorus: Vic Daggs II]
Said it's written on my face, I can't play it off
I got so much on my plate, I can't shake it off
But I'm built for this, I'm built for this
I been stayin' in my lane, keep my head down
I was losin' my faith, but I'm blessed now
God told me, ""You built for this""
I know I'm built for this

You weren't supposed to die here
You were supposed to fly here
Look what you built off your imagination
Could've never imagined the places you would've been taken because your ideas
This is in your veins, like where the IV is
My mama's Dodge minivan became my own at sixteen
Before sixteen ever got you a phone
Maybe when I was thirteen, twelve, eleven, who knows?
But I was in the back of that motherfucker writin' my poems
On shrooms with the busted boombox
Thinkin' that this special brew and beater, I was Tupac, nah
If I could go back and give that motherfucker advice
I'd say it was already written, boy, keep livin' your life
Put everything you got into your truth
That instrument you carry around, that is a tool
The most precious one you'll ever have, there's no shortcuts in the craft
Because the craft is actually just a path to discover you
It can get you pussy, respect, money, fame
And they love to call it, ""the game,"" but please do not get it confused
'Cause that's just the temptation that God is going to put in front of your face to see how bad you really want the jewel
And you don't run this shit, these are God's words
And when you catch the Holy Spirit, thank God first
Kill the ego, kill the need to keep on pleasin' people
Self-centeredness and self-will isn't how God works
We only here for a blink and it's gone
So, what you gonna do with the ink you use in your songs?
Regardless of your deal, or the label that you're on
When you die, the Universe already owns them all
[Outro: Macklemore]
That's God's will
It's all God's willEmbed"

I know my mama always told me I should drive slow
But I been bending corners with my eyes closed
Feel like I been sleeping on a tightrope
But its my time though
Run that back again I would throw it away
One way ticket Imma go MIA
Ain't no bottle big enough to hold all this pain
The world is gonna know my name

[Verse: Macklemore]
They told me don't spend too much time looking back
Stare at the future too long the present's what you're looking past
Mistakes can be hard to face in that looking glass
But I wouldn't be who I am if I took 'em back nah
Just a kid in the back of the bus in his headphones
Trying to crack at a bad one and not get left off in the friend zone
Put my name at the top in Helvetica where the letterhead goes
I'm rounding third and finally got that go ahead to head home
This is Grandma's cornbread flow
When the album's finished I'm taking the fam' to Venice
And I ain't going to Club Med though
I'm not well read no quoting Shakespeare off the head
But the mouthpieces always trend and a little more Detroit red though
The talk Pellegrino Arrowhead no
All my dawgs with me like I bought some stock in Petco
Off the leash all their bark is cheap
I finally cut the strings
I didn't want to have to dance and sing and answer to Geppetto
Life's too short whether I like it or not
I don't exist in the dimensions they put round my box
Just me myself a ceiling a couple of thoughts
No one on their deathbed regrets the things that they should've bought
The greatest resource is time and you can't buy back the clock
You can't rewind the tape and dub over the things I've watched
Only a matter of time before they pass the rock give me a shot I promised my mama Imma show the world what I got like

I see a fork in the road
I don't know what path I'm takin'
But my compass is broke
And I don't know if I'ma make it
Yeah, yeah
Told a lot of lies, pushed the love aside
Tried to drive away, but my hands are tied
Never givin' up, always stay and fight for me

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I been drivin' this road, I been drivin' this road
Uh-huh, fork in the middle, got two choices to go
Give the kids a kiss for me if I don't make it home
When I was growin' up, we didn't have a diagnosis
We just kept takin' more to get the serotonin
Got older and all of my homies overdosin'
And therapy wasn't an option to process our emotions
Mama always said, ""What you afraid of, boy?""
""Everything's good, you got angels, boy""
""Closed mouths go hungry, better raise your voice""
God-sized hole, no replacin' the void
We create out of chaos, the music is a seance
The land that our ancestors' graves on
My favorite artists are my two little girls
I see freedom first hand in what they make with their crayons

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Virgil said that when you make it to the penthouse
It's your duty to send the elevator back down
Somewhere along the highway I got lost
And I realized God was ahead of me all along
My mind on my business, grind my only mission
Most High, the messenger wasn't quiet enough to listen
My time was occupied, when even dinin' with my children
It's like me, myself, and I, and I lost sight of the vision
On borrowed time, livin' in extra innings
Industry survives, I'm glorifyin' the millions
The playlists and the streams, the album bundles and tees
But they cannot manufacture what resides in the spirit
The Phantom ain't enough if you don't remember all of the countless rides in the Civic
The moments of failure that proceeded this
Not givin' a fuck about other people's perception
That's what freedom is and that's what I'ma teach my kids
Any moment, peace is available, you just gotta remember to breathe it in and finally I can breathe again
Anyway, man, I'ma roll the dice
God got the wheel regardless of where I go in life
[Pre-Chorus: Macklemore]
I know tonight, it was always on glow
And when I was lost, I was on the right road
Tail lights ahead as I drive slow
Just a right turn then I find my way home

To wherever they may lead
I'll follow your tail lights
I'll try and match your speed

[Outro: Macklemore]
I don't use turn signals
Windows tinted, got a perfect view
World's endin', I'ma burn with you
Sun goin' down, gotta turn in soon, oh yeah
Lookin' in my rear view glass
Learnin' from the past with a beautiful crash
Write my name in the dust on the dash
It fades, but the memories last

You know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

R.I.P. Willy Wonka, watch the roof come off (Willy)
I pull up in that candy paint, call it Veruca Salt (skrrr)
You cheated and you lied, you broke the rules, my dawg (rules)
Now you wanna come around when there's food involved
Hell no
Let the truth be told, I'm in a Coogie robe
With the Dookie rope, and Lil Boosie on (Boosie)
I'm eating sushi rolls, doin' the tootsie roll (hey)
Thinkin' 'bout future goals, hater what you been on? (yeah)
I'm in a neutral zone, I'm 'bout to lose control
Then I'm hoppin' out, you think it's Rick Ross
I'm pullin' out in that Maybach
Didn't cop that from the thrift shop (hey)
With my daughter, singing ""Hakuna Matata""
Why they hootin' and hollerin'
I'm maneuverin' out to Budapest
And my baby momma duckin' the audit
The IRS been callin', tryna get in my wallet
But they ain't gettin' all of it
I put my feet up on the ottoman, I ought to be relaxin', y'all (relax)
'Cause I'm just 'bout that action boss, 'b-b-bout that action boss
I'm a motherfuckin' icon (icon)
Boots made of python (python)
I met with the Pres and I'm in Obama's iPod (hey)
My front yard got all kinda cars
Long Caddy, blue body, call it Avatar
I don't really fuck with the caviar
6 figures gets you 16 Wonka bars, give me that

I took a jet out to Punta Cana (pew, pew)
She got her lips 'round my my anaconda (oh!)
Hands on my hip when I grip the burner (brrrt)
Roll up some cookie, you smell the burner (cookie)

Blowin' up this money like a flute
I pipe the shit up but can't pipe that bitch up (pipe)
No, Super Bowl ring, but not one Super Bowl (hey)

I wanna be sober, but I love gettin' high
Wanna give it a hundred percent, but I'm too afraid to try
I wanna be faithful, but love hookin' up with randos
I wanna live by the law, but still think like a vandal
I wanna get exercise, but I'm too lazy to workout
I want all the finer things, but don't wanna go to work now
I wanna go outside, take my family to the beach
I wake up in the morning, first thing I do is look at a screen, at a screen

[Pre-Chorus: Macklemore]
Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?
I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV
And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me
I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking

[Chorus: Dan Caplen]
All my little problems keep on buildin' up, and buildin' up
All my good intentions just ain't good enough, can't find the love
So I smoke until my lungs are full
And drink until I lose my cool
Apology's my middle name, and one day I will change, but
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I want world peace, but I wanna watch Worldstar
I know that I should stay home, and still wanna kick it where the girls are
I wanna be a feminist, but I'm still watchin' porno
I wanna eat healthy, but I'ma eat this DiGiornos
We live on social media, read other people's thoughts
Tweet about justice, but don't show up to the march
I think about the earth, and I think about the eco
What am I willin' to sacrifice at the expense of my ego?

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 3: Macklemore & Kesha]
Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days
[Bridge: Kesha]
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change

Break out the velour suit and the Stacey's
Give me a baseline and a break beat
Fuck around on the dance floor, make a baby, watch me
Got a cane with a gold tip
Gucci ice cream tat type flow, bitch
I could make it rain, but I won't, shit
'Cause I'm cheap, motherfucker and I don't tip (I don't)
Watch out, I'm about to pull this new watch out, ta dow
Puttin' in work, we don't clock out
How 'bout, we go and cut the rug at the pow-wow
Get to movin' and breakin' and poppin' like wild style
Electric boogaloo
She movin' that body like a booty in a hula hoop
Gave her that look like, ""You don't know what I'd do to you""
And she was like ""Oh my God, I just Googled you""
Jheri curl, mullet on some Mario Lopez
Last call, then we go and hit the coat check
Lyft outside, buenos noches
Now tell that motherfucker, take us back to the homestead, gone

Sweatin' like I'm eatin' jalapeños out in Baghdad
You ain't on the level, got a medal for the flash dance
You ain't fucking gigging, what the hell you getting mad at?
I pulled up in that purple thang
I didn't dress like Prince in Purple Rain (oh my God)
Lions, cheetahs like the circus came

Hold up, do you know who I am?

Turn the block to Woodstock
Retire? Don't think that I could stop
Jet-ski the way I ride the beat
And fuck your wave, I'ma die knowing that I did me
I got some words and I cannot let them die in me
This is arena status
Our bones end up in the ground, does it even matter?
Make some good music, get what you put in
Get out and go and leave the planet
Now what the hell did you think this is?
We're born, we're dying, in-between we live
Love, prosper, hands to the sky, catch a gospel
Roll the dice, nah, I ain't betting on tomorrow
Chain looking like Orion's Belt
Jacket looking something like a lion pelt
Had to take a break and find myself
They put me in a box by myself

Are the same writers that gentrifyin' Bed-Stuy

Whip this bulky like Costco, I'm out here and dodging 5-0
I hit the block with that top low, a dookie rolled with a poncho
But it ain't about to rain on me
Tryna sing up in this bitch, but I ain't on key
Now I stay genuine, I'm the same old G
Feeling like John Havlicek, check, with these eight gold rings
Play the flute
[Chorus: King Draino]
Goddamn, they hatin' on a player (Why that?)
Don't understand, they need to get they weight up (Okay)
Shazam, I'ma have to David Blaine 'em (What you doin'?)
Emoji hands, I'm praying for them haters (Amen)

I paid my dues, now I'm really on
Prince to the SEA, put my city on
Left the condo for a bigger home
Everything clean like my chicken bones
I work hard, I work hard for it
Had to go back to the chalkboard
We was tourin' countries all foreign
Now I don't gotta open car doors
So say what's up to my haters at the club tonight
I'll be busy singing my daughter lullabies
When she sleep, I hit the booth and get super lit
Living my dreams I can sleep in another life
Living my dreams I can sleep in another life, yeah
The tensions so thick, you can cut with a butter knife, yeah
If that's your example of artists, then what am I?
You lied, they consume it, you say that you boomin'
That's probably why Metro don't trust you, gosh

[Chorus]
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah

Ten million sold, go and look at that
Ain't no middleman gonna get any of that
I suck at math, but I know how to add (1 + 1)
That's a whole lotta money
Bought my baby's momma momma a pad
Wow, do a spin move on stage looking like the white James Brown
There's a whole lotta people in this arena, you know it sold out (sold out, sold out)
Took my daughter on the road and she pointing at me from the crowd (from the crowd, from the crowd)
Saying, ""That's my daddy, top 5 on stage,"" no doubt
In God we trust, God we trust
They ain't came in the same way
They are not with us, not with us
Came back and it's game time
This the follow-up, and now I'm up
I decided that was not enough
Dopps and Budo with that final touch
Competition, go and line 'em up
I run this shit, I run this shit, put that on my momma
I done this shit, I done this shit, since I was pushin' a Honda
No one hit shit, no one hit shit, platinum plaques in mi casa
And my accountant's dead (rest in peace)
Couldn't count the commas

We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I still creep on your 'Gram, oh
See you with you and your man, oh
And I scroll, and see the pictures you deleted
Like the history ain't happened, long as we cannot see it
Getting back is insanity, and we repeat it
Momma said we need counseling
But I can't reason with a terrorist
Oh, this is embarrassing
You ain't Cinderella, ain't no pumpkin, turn them into fuckin' carriages
You create a narrative, people ask me ""Where's she been?""
Send her packing, now she's living back out at her parents' crib
Fight, break up, we fuck, we fight, break up, you know the deal
Vent to friends and tell them, ""This the last time, I'm for real""
You text me, then the next thing you know, I'm behind the wheel
Pull up, fuck you in the backseat thinking this will help us heal
There is no use for you texting my phone
Got FOMO the minute I walked out the door
Can't get in the gate because I changed the code
Now you can toast to the love we don't make anymore

Back on the ""Why didn't you text me?""
Back on the ""Shit, I was busy""
Back to us raising our voices
Back on that nobody's listening
Back to those horrible choices
Back on you moving back home
'Cause I would rather live in Hell than get comfortable sleeping alone
Back to that lying deception, back to the self-will
Back on that ""Well, she don't do it, and I know that somebody else will""
You cheated, I cheated, you cheated, I cheated, I mean it, please Father, forgive us
The dirt that you've done and the secrets that we swept up under the rug that are gonna die with us
And I tried to cut the ties so many times
That I finally gave up on the scissors
We are both sinners, if we both lie to ourselves
That is just selfish, that isn't commitment
I try to hold it and I try to hold it and
Numb to it all and ignoring it
I'm just searching where the closure is
Going in circles, not noticing
But in my heart, I know I'm not over it
[Chorus: Donna Missal]
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine

I know you're troubled, girl
I seen you on Tumblr
February, dressing like a summer girl
Mini skirt on, no underwear (Whoo!)
I wanna take you shopping
Blow a bag of Prada
She say ""Those clothes expensive""
So we end up at Zara
Late night, hit the city
And we go out to Target
Like why we go to Target?
This electric wheelchair's poppin'
You read bell hooks and Cornell West
You make me quesadillas when I'm stressed
And be like, ""Boy, you better clean up the mess
And take out the trash before you come back""
Stay in, amen, don't fall asleep 'til the AM
Wake up in the morning and I'm prayin'
Sunlight made its way in, gave me angels
And I hold 'em, paint a mural so golden (alright)
And my girl, she sweet as hell
But we'll have a world star moment
Like ""I'll fuck this bitch up"" (whoa)
Yes you will, my darling (aha)
Type of girl fight for the family (she will)
And jump in if there's a problem (progress)
But not today, the ocean waves
I can't complain, I hold her waist
My only ace until we're old and gray

Yeah, House Party 3 (ok)
Come spend the night with me (let's get it)
And bring your toiletries
You got your girls with you

Moms and pops, they used to take us to church
Saying ""If you don't believe, then the prayin' don't work""
With the beatbox I got free on the pavement, I'm first
Music brought me to my knees, I found faith in a verse
So dear Spirit, I know I gotta take a chance
And my mistakes and shortcomings finally made a man
I got some issues, I got problems, gotta make amends
I watch my daughter giggin' in the kitchen to the safety dance
This shit right here, we call love
You can't put that into words, but feel that in your gut
The goosebumps on my arms, I watch the fallin' sun
Kiss my daughter and say ""Thank God"" as I wake up
Oh I know, yeah, I know now
And I'm up, but I'm aware that it goes down
Travelled 'round the globe, I needed to slow down
And no better feeling riding 'round in my hometown

Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday mornin'
Been doing my own thing, can't say that I'm sorry

Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
If I could read the world my notebook and these thoughts in it
Would they judge me or love me for what I've written?
Tryna get closer to spirit that enters the body
It's the vessel like I'm not in it
In fifty-something years, I won't be here
There'll be a kid with some headphones coverin' his ears
Walkin' 'round a hallway, dreamin' of ideas
Find himself in the sound 'cause music is a mirror
What you looking for? What you headed towards?
What's your name worth when they mention yours?
When you leave here, are you stepping forward?
Can you remember your intention when they question yours?
They're gonna question yours, they're gonna question yours
I've been to rock bottom and I'm headed North
If you don't love yourself, what's the respect for?
If you don't love life, the check won't correct yours
Excavate

[Chorus: Saint Claire]
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace

I had this vision of my death
Surrounded by people I love and respect
In the baby blue Cadillac hearse
Pullin' me 'round the block that I rep
The greatest fear that I've ever kept
Is dying with regrets
Like was I just alive for success?
Or did I leave a better life for the rest?
My greatest achievement isn't the dollars
My greatest achievement isn't the followers
My greatest achievement isn't the accolades
My greatest achievement is my daughter
Wakin' up in the morning, bein' a father
Watchin' the light kiss her eyelids
Hearin' her sing along to Chance
And bein' like, ""Yeah, that's my kid""
The light started to glow
And the saxophone from Coltrane started to blow
Tender, laying in the snow, turn on my headphones
Couple miles to go before I run out of road
Excavate

[Chorus: Saint Claire]
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace
[Outro: Macklemore]
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read
Just flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read
Just flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?

Now when I say 2-0, you say
Nah, you know the rest
This is our scene
Our music, our movement, the history lives through us
I write to the beat and let life play the guitar strings
Despite the drama, there's respect and camaraderie
Every time one of my friends is mentioned in My Philosophy
It's a rite of passage, I'm not trying to be corny
I got love for Sportn' Life, Alpha P, Massline, and Onry
Every time somebody steps out on the road
They bring a little Northwest soul with them, amen
Alright then, just so you know
I try to carry that every time that I rock a show
So, turn my sound up
Ricochet off our mountain
It's Good Medicine that Chief Sealth would've been proud of
Sends our city, town pride, heart, blood, sweat, tears, I-5
North, South side, vibe, live, ride down these city blocks
And never will be stopped
They tryin' to shut down the clubs that my city rocks
Now Mr. Mayor why would you enforce an ordinance?
Music it saves lives, these kids out here are supporting it
And through the art form we've learned the importance of community
Truth to the youth so they know what's up
Yup, and as a public school student
I learned from my teachers, but became through my music
Take that away, that's a vital
14 Fathoms Deep, Do the Math, Tribal
My greatest teachers: B-Self and Vita
Wordsayer was my mayor and things have changed
But I carry the torch and what I do with that flame
Is lit every time that I step on the stage
The skyline is etched in my veins
You can never put that out, no matter how hard it rains

Northwest, making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do, coming to my side
I mean I like how y'all do
Thank you, but we onto new
Put it down for the town with music
Making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do, coming to my side
When my peeps know my crew bring the flame
Put it down for the town
Wearing that Seattle blue

[Verse 2]
That's right, when you put on a show
And watch the people seat in between the creases and the doors
Hitting up Meli or sneaking in 'cause they're broke
Not leaving in between sets because of needing to smoke
The reason being whatever
The scene from Beacon to Everett
Is in need of less ego when we kick it, alright?
I get on stage, style, share my whole life
Try to reach 'em at the bar where they're drinking Miller Lite
But the kids in the front, they bring out the passion, dude
Make noise throughout the show and not only when we ask 'em to
I watch the older cats jaded in the back
Hands clasped, forgot when they weren't too cool to be a fan, damn
Hatin' at the concert
You don't remember RKCNDY, watching Heiro, or vibing out to Alkaholiks
I know it's not the same, it never will be
But my, my, my, my city's filthy
And we've been truly dope
Since Supreme was up on Broadway in the dookie rope
Mean muggin' in Sir Mixalot's video
Back when Scene was rockin' house parties on the floor
JMG's, Sit N' Spin, and The Paradox
Back when Marc introduced Geo to Sabz
So much has changed here, so much has not
I was just a kid hopin' I could earn my spot
Try to get some props
Meet a promoter who'll give me a shot
To let me get up on stage and get the crowd to rock
Read a page out my notebook
What I thought would be respected, they would connect with it
Now looking over the city's the only thing that keeps me calm
Scattered thoughts jotted down by this pen in my palm
It's like my city stands still, the world looks on
If I could only capture its beauty and put it in a song13Embed"

[Verse 1]
I walked in with a pimp strut
… “What up?”
Door man’s like, “You on the list?”
I’m like, “Shiiii…
I should be there… like after the L’s”
He said it’s too early to tell
“Fuck it, go ahead.”
Afrika Bambaataa
Kool Herc was looping the break beat
Rocksteady was breakin’
That’s what’s up
Gave Scott La Rock dap
Proceeded up to the bar one Taki 183 and flat black was tight on the wall
Eddie Pint was with Dante
And went to bomb broadway
Sugarhill, Run-D.M.C. were kickin' raps
Busta and the Beasties came in, drinking brass monkeys
Bumrushed the show, hopped on stage then
A whole bunch of white dudes opened the door and came in
After Ed Lover, Dr. Dre then Big Daddy Kane
Said there ain't no half steppin', walk this way
Went to the next room had the 90's on it, ""hell yeah""
Ayo it smell like chronic
Hella juice & gin
I grab my cup, try to fill it to the brim
Somebody said ""Ayo, you ain't chipped in? I'm playing nephew, go ahead""
Ice Cube was choppin' it up
With MC Ren and Quik was playing the cuts
I saw Eazy, Spice 1, and King Tee
Bloods and Crips talkin shit and straight schemin’
Olde English, Starter caps, and gold daytons
Gold-plated, hearing Bones, Jheri curl activator
And the party started crackin
And this dude in the background who looked familiar started dancing...
But I don't know he seemed dope
The whole party was like he hadn't rapped in the east coast

Lyrical, physical, very artistical
Give the party people something funky to listen to
Step up if you wanna get hurt
Step, Step up if you wanna get hurt
All you MC's are some riders
All you need is a line
Til' you change and rearrange
And then what happened this time
I checkmate, terminate, never late, contemplate
Mind state is never fake, hesitate you lose

[Verse 2]
There was this group in the cypher called Das FX
And a Tribe Called Quest
Q-Tip was searchin' for his wallet sayin' somebody got him
10 dollars sayin' it was someone from Compton
LL was on the side of the kangol, talkin' about his Momma
Sayin' that if anyone stepped
They’d get knocked out. He promised
Watching Butter-Pecan Ricans licking their ice cream
Ghostface did lines, and Bees that were lime green
??????, liquorice and a dutch
I hit that shit once and then passed out off the blunt
I woke up in struggle for breath by Nas
He said sleep was the cousin of death, my God
Door busted down and I thought it was the cops
It was 2Pac saying that he had just gotten shot
Stood up out the wheel chair said “fuck this city.”
Grabbed a Cristal bottle, pointed it at Biggie
Puff jumped up was like “take that, one”
The whole party stopped and said…
2Pac left the party with Suge in the ‘lac
Nobody ever thought that ‘Pac would never come back
An hour later Big and Puff left
Big said he was ready to die, but there’d be life after his death
Craziest shit I’ve ever been to, the wildest venue
But it wasn't over yet, the party must continue...
Yeah, Yeah I said continue
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
[Hook 2]
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
Crucial, lyrical style ain't what it used to
Microphone check one two (echo)

[Verse 3]
For some, this is where the party began
Some say it’s where the party was crashed
There was a new room, a new dude named Shady in the Aftermath
""Hi, my name is, what..."" it was that everybody started to want to rap
Rock fans from the other parties put down their guitar straps
And started writing their bars on a pad
The ‘burbs were already in the building
And the media been feeling if another party was on smash
Pepsi endorsements, Spike, Coca-cola
Was tellin' the whole world where the party was at
The line to get in, it wasn't just around the building
It was around New Zealand and the underground was making chat
Saying it was wack; remember the art the heart, they taking it back
But it was too late for that, they started making, scratch the line
Complaining about the game, was saying it’s wack
Hold up, half the people that were dissing it
Were half the reason that the party was so big
And everyone in line was out there trying to get respect
And then the party got put on the internet
Shit
They bum-rushed the door
You couldn't move anymore
There wasn't room on the floor
And out came the neighbors
Getting on TV and complaining about the noise
Bill O’Reilly and Oprah came down and they started hating
The venue wasn't making money cause no one was paying
Unless you had Lil’ Wayne or T-Pain in the room
Nas came down and said the party was dead
Somebody lit a match all you heard was a

Thank God it's Friday
Got my paycheck and I'm going home
Leaving my job, on the highway, turn up my stereo
Because last weekend sucked
But this one's gonna be different
Because it's fucking Friday, I'm getting drunk and we gonna kick it
Then my friend's like, ""Hey man, what's going on?"" (""I don't know"")
We all know though that we're gonna get drunk at the club
Get it crunk to the same shit we did the week before
Meet at the store
Free funking in my house
In high school it was drinking games
Bad house parties in Ike's house
But now we go on the town
We gotta hit the club
We gotta spend them bucks
And we gotta get it crunk
Seven for a drink and fifteen cash at the entrance
And thank heavens Wells Fargo's got overdraft protection
We walked up in
Yes, they're spinning R.Kelly's remix to the remix about a chick and skeeted on her belly
The females (woop, woop) they're done and there're plenty
I got two dollars... ah, charge it, bartender a round of Henny!

[Hook]
We're going to the club, club
Pour me another one, gotta get numb, numb
Hopefully end up with a girl I can fuck, fuck
Oops, baby you know that I meant love, love
Who's coming with me back to my tub, tub?
""Now, Macklemore, you know you ain't got no hot tub, man,"" tub, tub

Like this sucks, I'm hella bored
Decided to cut the rug with a female, like stellar on the floor
Break her off her stiletto, sore
Thought she was Puerto Rican, started talking
I'm like, ""Woops, it's a honky, she's just hella orange""
My homie's like, ""Mack, what you tell her for? She was feeling you""
""Dawg, I could peel her foo, this is Washington not Florida""
The white girls are looking for some big black dick
The black girls are all, ""Yeah he's cute for a white guy, but that's about it""
Asians kicking with Asians
And the Latinos are too beautiful
Wish I could confidently be like, ""Girl you don't know what I could do to you""
Get her back to the pad and probably bust in my pants
She'd be like, ""Ooh, ah, pappy,"" I'd be like... sorry
Think I'mma buy you a drink? Better find you a shrink
(""I'm rich bitch, psych"")
I sling CDs and grind tapes, bet your boyfriend can't spit
Get the clit to vibrate
I should have stayed home, I get more chicks on MySpace

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
There's that sweaty girl (sweaty girl)
In the corner on e-bomb
Thinking she's in a Missy video but really looks like a retard
And there's the wall muggers (wall muggers)
That shout just to seem hard
And there's the ball suckers (ball suckers)
That fight and just seem odd
I spent seventy-five dollars and these drinks don't work
Who the hell's this ugly, taint skank?
Why are my friends in pink shirts?
My hat's too big
My air-force's were clean when I came here
Now they're stained in beer
And who peed on my white tee?
I thought this was the spot, I was supposed to get jocked
There's a dude talking on chickens and they're clucking for cocks
Funny thing is, we're all insecure
That's why we call the bartender and tell him to give us a beer
Until our judgement is blurred and little voices slush and they slur
We getting faded, waking up hungover and going to work
Do it every weekend, this is the life
You better peep it
And it ain't no secret the club sucks, but do we go?
Better believe it!

Now we live from the side of the last of the four corners
Just short of the northern international border
Was born a town upon the pond that all the people call The Sound
It’s time to call ‘em out, you standin’ up or fallin’ down?
Saba dug inside a crate and Jake responded, he was on it
We interpreted the sample, canceled
The opportunist on the corner acting stupid
We plotting to take it back
The crying and dedication on Gentrification Ave
No imitation of way back, preservationist rap
We honor the past maybe to move it toward the future
From fresh tracks to Emerald Street, its foundation
And Mr. Anthony Grey paved the way and now we chase him
But they didn’t have the patience to place it as a priority
Herbs and haters never have served the greater majority
Words will never capture the glory of our story
Performing but never forgetting who came before me
In the Northwest, Northwest, Northwest, Northwest

[Verse 2: DJ Sabzi]
I’m from the city where it rains at
Where we bring the pain at
Put you lame cats where the lames at
We fly, we fresh, we hood

I’m good with that nonsense
See I’m on everything constant
So you better ask him who I’m is

The town is enhancing at the current date and time
And in the state of refinement definitive way to climb
When its sink or swim
You want to test us? Better think again
Going hard ‘til we reach the end
One day at a time I just move faster, I just move forward, I just move past ya
This is a new chapter from here on after

I’m from the city of rain and we came to spit flame
But come equipt with many mix that could solicit your dame
I’m kind of sick with it mane
I’m from the city where you probably find ‘em twisted in chain
I keep it natural that’s the name
I love my town so damn much I never change
But I will speak to you through rhythms and over melodies
Travel the Emerald City with visions that you’ll never see
And clowns that front ain’t worth my energy
So here’s the remedy
Northwest, northwest, northwest, northwest

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
I was that kid on 23rd and Alder
With the ghettoblaster, got jacked, ran and told my mama
Came back, quarterback, playing Steve Largent
With lines and stay on your mind like Brian Bosworth
Aw heck no, this the best coast
Since Vita was ridin’ rays on the metro
One radio station they're really not playing it
We need Kube like we need to build another stadium
From Chop to Showbox to the spots that we playin’ at
We rock it like this rock, rock turn it hella quickly
There really isn’t anything that you could tell my city
The crowds gonna be like, “Oh wow, that was hella filthy”
(""That was hella filthy, though"")
I brought my shelltoes with me, long-ass march, but the clientele’s listening
Now while I’m at it I’ll throw in a backpack
Put the Northwest on the map, then go out and sell fifty
[Hook x2]
Anybody contest, North by Northwest
And it's still no rest cause we're not finished yet
We're broke, but not broken
Cold, but not frozen
Lost but not forgotten, we're kickin' the doors openEmbed"

I swear I've been here before, there’s a war in my heart
Inside my chest is a thorn, it's been torn from the start
The picture painted is warped, the hearts aching and scarred
Music’s the band-aid I’m too afraid to take this shit off
Another drink at the bar, but I’m not drunk enough
Each shot burns less but the chest isn’t numbin' up
A voice keeps talkin’ in my head and I’ma fuck him up
Fill the gun with lead and bust until the pump shuts him up
Emos and rockers and rockers and emos
Another shot of some vodka to get myself up off of my ego
There’s a door to my conscience, I can’t unlock it or see the peephole
This angel held my baggage and then vanished like where did she go
I was beside her but I was walking by myself though
Break the silence with my cell phone it doesn’t help though
I can’t believe this is happening, sinking into depression
I’ve been here before and now I’m back again

[Hook]
I keep fallin, I keep fallin, I keep fallin, down the rain
Keeps pourin, keeps pourin, I don’t know if I can get up today
Keep fallin, I keep fallin, fallin, down the rain
Keeps pourin, keeps pourin, I don’t know if I can get up today

[Verse 2]
6 am hung over leaving my booty call watch the sunrise
Head over I-5 headed North but there’s no sign of sunshine
Empty brandy bottles spilled on the forgotten memories
Know I gotta let her go I’m just to selfish to set it free
Life forced release, two hours later I just got up and bounced
If she could only see me now head lost swallowed and drowned
The path is up but I followed it down
A man gone and hollowed out because you opened it up
You can’t start over now
What’s to keep going for?
Validated by drunken whores
Bloody knuckles so numb and sore from punching these rusty doors
Freeway signs underpasses man stranded dusty mattress
This world is bipolar, beautiful for some for others the fuckin’ saddest
So sick of lugging baggage
All I got is drugs and alcohol and these cuts of passion
Brain serenade razorblade, punk madness
Pain is love plug the drain but the rain keeps crashing like

[Geologic]
Stand up, sit down, stand up again
Morse Code sent to God, are you listening?
He must have been too busy fixing other shit
No call, no response shows the opposite
We confess to the man who was faceless
I still do the same but to thousands of strangers
Went through some changes, some said I'm faithless
Cause I replaced the altar with a basement
I often fought the explanation of where people go when their bodies let go of the soul
Does it just turn cold?
Or do we get judged and told where to go?
And if so, how the fuck would you know if nobody came back and said I'm telling you, bro?
I could never get past the shit that was spit out the pastor's lips
And the rapper's started making more sense
I guess that's the reason that some people cringe when they kids get a hold of my shit
If the grip of a God is insistent on not questioning if he truly exists
No wonder that I got caught up in the music it filled my spirit to the brim, amen
Motha' fucker

[Macklemore]
This is my offering card
The only thing I have to offer is bars
The only time I felt like I was talking to God
Was in my Walkman walking with Nas
Alright see I be going to Sunday school every week
In the back trying to read, but see that something was off
Maybe it was cause I was trying to huddle in the yard
Preacher didn't connect when he would mumble the Psalms
I was in my head and I was bustin' with Pac
Takin' off my wifebeater and getting drunk in the park
After that part, I found God, it wasn't Jesus
Some psilocybin and the ink it released
I began to hold communion every time my music came out the speakers I used it
And it fuled my movement I believed in, voice of reason, just me and my Adidas
And I could achieve it, I put my hand over my heart, pledge allegiance
I solemnly swear by the faith that raised my since Kool Herc dropped that needle
The South Bronx, that's hip-hop's Egypt
The word of our God is manipulated and twisted by the same system
That is infiltrated and falsely interpreted Jesus
One life, one love, one God, It's us, treat your neighbor how you would want to be treated
The universal laws of God, don't look too far it's right here, us human beings
The spirits right here and I don't have to see it
Now every time I want to connect with God I put my headphones on
Then I nod, grab my pen, my pad, let it seep in, in
And that's my process
And God's always watching

I've been obsessed with words ever since I was a little buck
Then I grew bigger and figured drawing pads weren't big enough
I wanted to use a wall, but in school was taught not to
And that graffiti was the root of all evil
It's just letters and making them unnatural shapes
So clean caps, surgical masks is actually sayin' activate
To coat our empire
Liftin' mad cans of paint from Fred Meyer's
Empty 'em out under bridges and walls of alleyways
Giving the graff task force a sour taste
The same flavor that makes haters salivate
I was more gully as a minor, caught a felony, so nowadays
I don't struggle to prove nothing to you
I get a head full of letters, I'm cutting 'em loose
Up in the booth, cousin, it ain't a gift, it's a habit
Whether good or bad, I won't regret it when I'm looking back

[Hook: Sapient]
‘Cause I'm a letterhead
I'm a letterhead
So don't sweat the technique
When I represent me; get 'em!

[Verse 2: Illmaculate]
Lunch time, I was tryin' to bring that realness back
Fuck the lunch line, 'cause I ain't have no skrill or scratch
I was on the way to Fred Meyer's just to fill my bags
Steppin' in the home improvement section with my sticky hands
That's why I got these baggy pants: to conceal the stash
But undercover security can't conceal his badge
I know every single camera that this building has
And I racked so many cans that I'm almost feelin' bad
That's exactly what a bad look ain't
‘Cause it's quite good, like the Backwood taste
And I never stole a Snickers, but I have took paint
So, hello, my name is pickers in the blackbook, thanks!
Shit, I'd be admired if I was tryin' harder
But I'm a riot starter, beef igniter
Just a street writer, but I hope to die a martyr
Freedom fighter, with a stolen Pilot marker

I was just a kid in Seattle, doin' kickflips in a flannel
With some fat caps, I racked off midget enamels
In Cali, they rhyme ""Shelltoes"" with ""Melrose""
My posse was on Broadway, scribin' on the metros
Gettin' pound by the bus driver — ""Hell nah!""
I was a letterhead, my life was graffiti
Letters I lived, I put pride in that mean street
Adventures to your ribs, I'm not goin' to the precinct
You can buff me, you can cuff me, you can't stop me
I'm young, cocky, gettin' up with my sharpie
Michelangelo with the concrete
That little ball in the paint can
Was the metronome to my heartbeat
I put my freedom on the line for the letters on the walls
Shubu, patriot, flat black up in my palm
Cherry red in my blood, I bleed the ink through my arms
It's like America: bombin' buildings and not gettin' caught

Still trying to figure out what I find comfortin'
And who's gonna take account for all this sufferin'?
It's not always gloomy, I'm assuming if you sing too
It might give me the power to wake up a-gain
Let's be honest, it's kind of hard to find beauty here
And a cobweb of a long leg, solace it would appear
Solid, Mr. blockhead with a wooden spirit
Tell the doctor we're all dead and it's looking serious
I've been at shows where the acted like they couldn't hear it
So I substituted my saliva for truth serum
This crooked look is piercing, it could burn a hole through you
I see through your two-faced ways despite the both of you
Askin' for a penny in a mechanical city
Black phantom of the back alleys, poet of the square smokers
Rappin' filthy where the animals with guilty pasts
Ration out their fat yellow bellies or the share holders

[Hook]
Damn it's cold here
Will the people start dancing when the smoke clears?
I need a reason to keep walkin'
Day dreamin' of the evil in my walkman
Say a prayer for the people in the audience
Say a prayer for the people in their coffins
And keep walkin'

Vanish through the alleyways (ghosts)
Past the green room
Enough drink tickets to the point where I can't perceive truth
If God is in the building then I can't see you
Even if they put their hands up in the air that won't redeem you (shows)
It's the place where they start fables
They spend money on jack and coke but are flat broke when they hit the merch table
No hand out for the wolves and the people that are hungry
And won't sacrifice records to get some cheddar with their lunch meat
I just pray for that some day, but around here we get more rain then we ever get a sun break
It's never enough to get something and I wish I could say that I was humble enough to be blessed that some came
But it feels like hip hop's dead, I don't know who killed it
The poison in the pen or in the heads of who built it
If I don't know the ledge how can I expect that the children won't jump to their death when they question what real is?

[Hook]
The air is cold here
Will the people start dancing when the smoke clears?

Feels like a night for a party
My nature so naughty
There's a knock on the door, it's the neighbors
Quit cock-blocking
We're having a ho-down, are you hoes down?
Don't let me pull my hose out
'Cause it's big, long, pink, strong
And been known to dance, like, all night long
Grab my hand, play this song
DJ, save my life, come on
Leave your fear, back off the wall
Free of beat and pussy pop
And if you don't have a pussy
Pop a cock into a booty

I will dance, I will dance, I will break that ass off
And I see you in the corner, corner looking so small
Doing the robot like, ""If I die tonight, at least I went hard""
I will not, I will not give a damn who watches me
I will live, I will live, liberate the fox in me
I will be the disco ball, freaking give my all
To whatever girl's booty I'm freaking on
I'm not skeeting, nah, it's just freaking hot
Alright, I skeeted

[Verse 3]
I will not be a mannequin (No), the ego, banish it
The roof's on fire, let's burn down the Vatican
I will moonwalk to Pluto in honor of Michael Jackson
In heaven he'll be saying, ""That man is tight at dancing""
RIP to the king, Michael Jackson, we learned it all from you
Dedicate this to the dance floor
Party up the sorrow 'til tomorrow morning happens
We pledge allegiance to the DJ, put your hands up
[Chorus]
And we danced (Oh)
And we cried (Oh)
And we laughed (Oh-oh)
And had a really, really, really good time (Oh)
Take my hand (Oh), let's have a blast (Oh-oh)
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives

But your friends are huddled up and they are hating on a player

I see so many people lost who really try to pretend
But am I just another white boy who has caught on to the trend?
When I take a step to the mic is hip-hop closer to the end?
'Cause when I go to shows the majority have white skin
They marketed the windmill, the air flair and head spin
And white rappers' albums really get the most spins
The face of hip-hop has changed a lot since Eminem
And if he's taking away black artists' profits, I look just like him
Claimed a culture that wasn't mine, the way of the American
Hip-hop is gentrified, and where will all the people live?
It's like the Central District, Beacon Hill to the South End
Being pushed farther away because of what white people did, now
Where's my place in a music that's been taken by my race
Culturally appropriated by the white face?
And we don't want to admit that this is existing
So scared to acknowledge the benefits of our white privilege
'Cause it's human nature to want to be part of something different
Especially when your ancestors are European Christians
And most whites don't want to acknowledge this is occurring
'Cause we got the best deal, the music without the burden
Of being black in a system that really wants you to rock
'Cause all you need is a program and you can go and make hip-hop
And we hate the mainstream 'cause we're the ones that took it
Now we listen to Aesop Rock and wear t-shirts that say ""Brooklyn""
But it's not about black and white, right?
I mean good music is good music regardless of what you look like
But when you don't give them props isn't that selfish?
That's like saying rock was actually started by Elvis
So where does this leave me?
I feel like I pay dues, but I'll always be a white MC
I give everything I have when I write a rhyme
But that doesn't change the fact that this culture's not mine

[Chorus]
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means I'm not keeping it true, nope
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means I'm not keeping it true, I'm not keeping it true

[Verse 2]
Now I don't rap about guns, so they label me conscious
But I don't rap about guns 'cause I wasn't forced into the projects
See I was put in the position where I could choose my options
Blessed with the privilege that my parents could send me to college
Now who's going to shows, the kids on the block starving?
Or the white people with dough that can relate to my content?
Marketed the music, now adapted to the lifestyle
What happened to jazz and rock and roll is happening right now
Where's my place in the music that's been taken by the media
With white corporations controlling what they're feedin' ya?
I brought up Aesop Rock, but I'm not even dissing, dude
We love hip-hop, and what do you think caucasians are listening to?
And I speak freely when I write this
If a black MC examined race, there goes half their fan base, white kids
And this is so true
And we didn't even have to fight the system, we just went and picked up the microphone too
And we got good at it so we should be rappin'
But only supporting them is like burning Jimi and buying Clapton
Now Clapton's incredible, but no Jimi, no foundation
So here comes history and the cultural appropriation
White kids with do-rags trying to practice their accents
From the suburbs to the upper-class, mastering a language
But hip-hop is not just memorizing words
It's rooted in authenticity, something you literally can't learn
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm gonna be me, so please be who you are
This is something that's effortless and shouldn't be hard
I said I'm gonna be me, so please be who you are
But as I'm blessed with the privilege, they're still left with the scars

[Chorus]
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow, too?
That means I'm not keeping it true, nope
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow, too?
That means I'm not keeping it true, I'm not keeping it true17Embed"

Ladies and gentlemans
This an ode to the B-boys, B-girls
The people out there who do it for the love
And believe me I'm not dissin' anybody out there who's trying to get paid
I'm trying to get paid too!
But I got one question

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Whatever happened to the heart?
That pumped the passion into the art?
The entity that gave you the energy to wanna start?
Breakdancing, I'm battling, doing it at the park
Where the mission was expression, not only to top charts
I don't know what happened, wanting to blow rap
You lose soul and passion for the flows and the tracks
Radio's lacking, controlled by fascists, assholes doing damage
But we're gonna take it back
Before beats to a hundred G's a pop
All you needed was a tabletop and a beatbox
Hip-hop without the B-boy is like shelltoes only having two stripes
Hip-hop, we're freedom-fighting, graffiti-writing, party types
That recite and organize and revitalize our rhyming
'Til the group of the moneymakers systems
Knows that the industry can eventually get served
Breakers of my verses spinning up a revolution throughout our words
If you really want it, come on get it, cause I've got it
I'm honestly paying homage to forgotten pioneers of this culture that are giving them props and learn
If you wanna earn your stripes
You gotta be able to rock this mic and set cyphers alike
The feeling to put in everything you got in the circle
Will never be documented in the Coke commercial

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now B-boys, B-girls
Bring it back to the block
Lemme see you get ill, for real, pop and lock!
If you record without thought then stop
Because I'll serve your whole album with the goddamn beatbox
Without thought it just happens
If you gotta think to feel, that's not rapping, that's acting
I'm from a land of backpacks and fat cats
MCs with sick raps who serve those that are wack
It's a way of life
I put all my energy into the melody
On the mp3s until the death of me
Record exceptionally, especially
Whenever I be monumentally, grammatically, killing the mic
I tell my DJs, cranking that music, keeping 'em moving when the beat plays
Staying into it, breaking and grooving, and MCs they
Thinking that you should always pursue in what their dreams make
Taking from lucid to really do it
All the people gotta make their money
And the way to make money is to get inside of the industry
Take it on the radio, flow
So you can go blow, we get a car
And a crib up on MTV
But in the end what's classic?
Radio bubblegum? Or a voice filled with passion?
To my real hip-hop heads, please stand up
Cause the only people that can preserve this art is us5Embed"

Life moves pretty fast
You don't stop and look around once in a while you could miss it

[Verse 1: Ka.lil (aka Khingz) of Abyssinian Creole]
Look, I've been away from my city, the city's changes ain't pretty
Babies still playing in ditchy forgotten corners
The city's forgotten its warriors
Who died young
Eyes hating the sun that's shining before us
How rotten bodies fertilizing the forest of concrete and glass
Foul hearted police aiming their gats
My head hang over beats
I hope my ghosts stay in the past
And days I couldn't play to the pad
We the same kids they'd be sending to invade Iraq
And ""make it safe"" with crack
I got that Gray Goose and OJ in a glass
The last day before my cousin hit the pen
Down to swing
I came back to the town just to be down with the king
And loving surroundings it seems
Just then he find out his baby cousin fell off a balcony
Images of a violent paradise is drowning me
Lost souls and I can't let go or tell no
The same scenario that rules South Othello
Black, Browns and yellow
Southsiders tell the devil ""hello""
And heaven ""bye""
And it hurts too much to ask why

From the places with plenty
To the space with no pity
The forces changing our city
One day at a time
If I don't change what's been given
What can I say to my children
Who gonna be claiming this city
One day...

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I grew up on Capitol Hill
With two parents and two cars
They had a beautiful marriage
We even had a swing set in our yard
My mom didn't have a job, because my dad made enough
Money that we could live comfortably and he could support us
Now, he'd commute to Tacoma, so we knew we'd be good
But then I realized everybody looked just like me in my neighborhood
I'd go to school, which was diverse
But indeed us, I got sandwiches and Capri-Sun's
And my friends ate the free lunch
It's crazy trying to look back, cause when I was growing up
I didn't understand the fact was
There's something called a social status
And my black friends weren't in my financial bracket
And then my city's divided
From neighborhood to neighborhood
We're polarized but we claim that we're progressive
The police shoot in the hood but never once in my residence
Has a white person been shot or even stopped in a Lexus?
And to think that we claim that so much has changed
Since Brown versus the Board of Education and Roe versus Wade
But around my way it all stays the same
They just figured out a way to separate the black and white face
[Hook]
From the places with plenty
To the space with no pity
The forces changing our city
One day at a time
If I don't change what's been given
What can I say to my children
Who gonna be claiming this city
One day...
From the places with plenty
To the space with no pity
The forces changing our city
One day at a time
If I don't change what's been given
What can I say to my children
Who gonna be claiming this city
One day...

[Verse 3: Gabriel Teodros of Abyssinian Creole]
Say it's the richest city in the world, right?
Images of Tent City in the shadows of Amazon's office site
In the jungle down the slide in Jose Rizal's park
There's this part in the gate, with a trail to a place over I-5
Where families survive, most my early life we've known about it
Called development? They kicked them folks out
And moved them around every chance they can since
So scared of homelessness, but ignoring them ain't gonna change it
And tearing down the 'jects ain't gonna make your ass safer
For all that paper wasted just to build up Safeco
While Garfield High School still remains like a slave boat
We gave up on hope, a long time ago, so
I wake on this floor, after pacing hours before
Mind racing like a child torn in war zones
With every side challenged
Needing to manage and understand this balance
I can't fall or falter
Brother, I'm just an author
And no amount of words offered has ever been enough to alter this system
Swallowing souls broke
My own folks roam upcoast
Holding dreams close of what America was supposed to be
But works for the rich only
This Southend in reality
Took my family back to what they was running from before
When they left that war
Same shit, different continent
Home don't exist anymore
Home don't exist anymore
The 206 that raised me just ain't the same, yo

All those moments
All those moments
All those moments will be lost, in time

Ladies and gentleman, my name is Macklemore. This is my music, and it feels so damn good right about now. Check it, I got a story, yo, it goes a little something like

[Verse 1]
When I was seventeen I was staying in NYC
And my homie told me where I could get a fake ID
""Ayo, son, you better get that shit when you in NY"" (okay)
So I hopped on the subway and I gave it a try
To my pleasant surprise the ID looked fine
5'9"", blues eyes, born in nineteen-seventy-nine (just right)
Nervous as hell, I went to the store with my homie
Came out and yelled ""Dawg, they sold me a 40""
Yeah, you know that I was the man
Buying liquid contraband with a fake ass hologram
No more looking for bums, standing in the rain
Stranded on Broadway and giving 'em all my change
For the rest of the summer man I was on fades
Seventeen, had it made, getting drunk everyday
Ayy, I got treated a whole new way
Because of a piece of plastic that proved I was of age

[Interlude]
You know what I'm saying, all of a sudden you get this little piece of plastic and you're in the club. Seventeen like bah! Check it out, it's like this, yo

[Verse 2]
Now for the next three years I had so much fun
Getting drunk in hip-hop clubs where you had to be twenty-one
Then one day I was walking and I saw a sign
That said KRS-One twenty-one up and live
That's hella tight
Ayo I heard he always ripped it
So I hopped up in my Civic and went out to buy a ticket
When I got up the the door the bouncer checking ID's
Looks at mine and he's like ""Nah, we don't take these""
I tried to reach and grab my shit back
But the mother fucker was tougher than Shaq, on crack
I should've punched him, but I would have reached his knee cap
And that probably wouldn't have hurt him very much
He kept laughing and smilin', he called me a dumb shit
And if I would've let myself I would have cried in public
Oh no, I'm like ""Give it back, bro!""
But no, my ID was jacked by the Caucasian Deebo

Ha I'm laughing right now but at the time it really was not funny and it's still not very funny. Fucker

[Verse 3]
Bitch why you got to take my ID?
Why do I have to be 21 to drink a Long Island Iced Tea?
I hate bouncers with their bald heads and ten foot tall legs
And shirts that they outgrew when they were like ten
*Get 'em*
Your mother is dumb for having you
You're a bouncer because you have a small dick and as a kid everyone laughed at you
*Get 'em*
You're too big and you never seemed to listen
You look injected with the shit they give to KFC chickens
*Get 'em*
I don't like ya, at all I despise you
If I was tall I would fight you
If I was a dog I would bite you
Every single day you make people cry
And your job is to go and ruin teenager's lives
Ok I'm going too far bouncers aren't all bad
I'm sure they make great husbands and really strong dads
But hopefully you learned a lesson from me
Never take an MC's fake ID
Yup, I said never take an MC's fake ID
You could be buff and tough, it don't matter to me
Cause you're going to get burned if you step to MCs4Embed"

Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky

Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by

Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky

Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
A friend of mine once told me, ""We have many paths in this journey""
They act in different directions, so when you question don't be worried
It's not a wrong one, beauty can be found in all of them
You'll meet people whose paths intersect, but you don't know how long you'll walk with them
Cause the truth is, and it's so hard, but you'll never know
How long we'll continue with our loved ones down this rugged road
The path veers and it's clear that we must steer alone
I've learned if you can't hold on to that moment that exists- let it go
Cause freedom is God
Freedom is acknowledging the mask you have on and possessing the strength to take it off
Freedom is accepting every step of the path
And when it's hard having faith in the ability to embrace it, that's where you are
And this is it
The same shit that we work towards, but go against in the same sense
My friend hit me to some game and truth unraveled, she said, ""The brighter the light, the darker the shadow""
And since I'm on cliche terms, knowing is half the battle
But I don't know, so I just go with what was destined
Life can be a burden or a blessing
The choice is yours to be connected
It's there if you want it, you got it, now let it

[Verse 2]
I feel like I have nothing to give right now
This is my trial, tribulations, and it must go down
But where's the up? I'm stuck with the broken smile
No joking now, wanting to grab a swish and smoke this out
The moment of a man choosing what path I will go down
Do I give in, give up, or get up and live right now?
With a split gut pick myself up and spit my style
This is the only thing that can hold my ground
You're born into this world alone, and alone you'll go out
All I have is myself and everyone else I doubt
You can only trust yourself and depend on the help of the pound
Inside of the chest that beats with the breath of the now
No sunshine when she's gone, I can only see clouds
No homies can hold me down, the spirit's testing me now
But I can withstand this world, but it seems so foul
Flood of emotions, it's like I'm being held down to drown
Hell's right around the corner, but I can turn it around
You always have a choice, no matter the situation you're not bound
To nothing, no one, you're chosen for this job
This is your life, you can't escape this bitch when it's hard
Just know that it passes, but you'll collect scars
They never go away, but they will make you who you are
This is a beautiful struggle, I share it in song cause
I can't control this, remember: the moment's beyond us

Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky

Ladies and gentlemen, Sekken Thaughtz on the beat
(And you know how I feel) Big up to Lace Cadence
Good lookin' out for this one, man

[Verse 1]
I love hip-hop music, I just hate the ego
The politics that follow it, getting caught in it can be lethal
See I love the community, 'cause a community will embrace you
But you turn it back the community is the people that will hate you
See everybody's striving for that same shit
To get paid and make it, and I'ma be honest, I'm tryna become famous
When someone makes a move watch that person next to you
Cause I'll warn ya
I love Hova but jealousy's The Takeover
Here come the mean mugs
""I can't do what he does""
And where does that lead us?
To the ego that feeds us
I wish that I could just do what I do
But when a door opens for him I'm afraid there won't be enough room
Comparison's a mother fucker
Like MLK said
""We all want that band leader syndrome and it won't stop""
This concept makes me wonder, is it the commodity
Of the music or the ego that is killing hip-hop?

It's the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
It's the ego that makes me talk shit behind people's back
You know that it's the ego that's constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
It's the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged
I said it's the ego that has me trippin' about the next man
You know that it's the ego that makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want

[Verse 2]
""I'm so cool""
For real?
You know dude, I'm serious spit it different and if you just flow too
I'll listen lookin' for glitches and rip 'em to shove improve
That my rhythm's a little bit more intricate, just to boost
My ego, it's so evil
Threatened by so many different kinds of people
It seems that if you're going through somethin' and life is feeling uncomfortable
The immediate place you go is to your ego to comfort you
When Boom Bap got signed I hated on him
When Grayskul got signed I hated Onry
And that's hard to admit, but since I'm really being honest
I wanted to be one of the first to make it as a Northwest rap artist
Instead of taking it as a plus for my region
I took it as a cut to my dreams of makin' it out of this political scene of
Northwest haters to be next, I guess I'm just like them
Jealous of who's taking that step
[Chorus]
It's the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
It's the ego that makes me talk shit behind people's back
You know that it's the ego that's constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it

I said it's the ego that has me trippin' about the next man
You know that it's the ego that makes me not go to the front

[Verse 3]
Now everybody got one but people trying to front
Claiming that they on the humble but cocky
Now it comes up when we judge
Or are threatened by someone
But everyone still be like ""man that's not me""
Now let me break it down son
It's only a lack of love for ourselves
Cause we're submerged in ""I gotta be""
The best or number one
But it's just that we don't trust

Yeah
Bring my drums in, bring my drums in
Now bring my drums in, Now bring my drums in
Nod your head come on now nod your head I’m gonna do it a check in

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Yo, we all know that life can get hectic
But if you live in the second
You exist in the present
And that's how you stay connected
Through good times and hardships if you learn to just accept it
And know that every struggle in life is there to teach you a lesson
It's times like this that make you
It's always the darkest part of the night right before the sun has its breakthrough
The spirit's there to knock you down, but if you make that the end
You'll never know the beauty of being able to stand up again
And face it with patience
The basis is dealing with judgements and hatred, depressed hopeless feelings
But I've been told that you only create your own ceiling
And life is limitless and knowing this is what the spirit is

[Hook: Macklemore]
That's why I try and inhale deep
So I can find peace
In essence just find me
That's why I lose myself in these beats
As I become one with the drum and set myself free

Whatever direction life leads me
There's a purpose behind it, that's the way it was supposed to be
At anytime you could turn over a new leaf
We all know the truth, it's up to us to use the key
It's been three years since my first album dropped
And it's been fear that's really got me stuck in this spot
Not wanting to put out anything whack
So instead of putting my licks on tracks
I put my lips to a sack
Cause it's easier to spend your life drunk and high on drugs
Than to put everything in a recording, put it out, and then get judged
We look for the audience to put their hands up and show love
But when their hands go down, our confidence really takes the plunge
So instead of making music that people might not like
I went into isolation and traded in my mic for the pipe
Started living the college life - drinking and smoking every day
Rationalizing to myself that I was going through a phase
That I'd stop, thinking my music would take its place
But when you live in fog, inspiration's hard to create
It takes more to get connected than to quit smoking for a day
And when I get frustrated I get a Swisher and get blown away
Then all of a sudden it hit me: these kids are listening
If I'm not making music then why the fuck am I existing?
How can I talk about the problems of something else
When I don't have the motivation and confidence to change myself?
It's been so long since I really truly felt
What it's like to live life without substances to help
Massive struggle, that's natural to one's health
But with addiction in my blood, I play the cards I was dealt
Knowing that it's the most calm right before the storm
And when you least expect it, it doesn't rain it pours
I swear to God you can never be warned
And with or without umbrella nature's still gonna' take its course
[Hook]
That's why I try and inhale deep
So I can find peace
In essence just find me
That's why I lose myself in these beats
Put away the weed and turn to my M.P.C3Embed"

Hello Americans
My name is George Bush, and I'm going to do a rap for ya'll
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm from Texas
We're homophobic and sexist
And if these Mexicans keep coming in I'm 'a dismember 'em
You don't see me in El Paso, selling their tacos
Shit in my el baño, I'll cut off your asshole
Goddamn it, don't even talk about the faggots
If I ever seen one singing the national anthem I'ma strangle 'em
Hell nah, they can't get married, but they can fight in the military
Hopefully they'll end up buried in a cemetery
I don't even consider 'em people
Go ahead put 'em in the front lines
Next to the Negroes
But I'm not racist
Colin Powell's like my brother, alright I admit it I hate him
Where's Dick Cheney at? Probably off in Iraq
Finding some oil to tap, tell 'em I got up on that
And y'all still think it was Bin Laden
When it was us and the Masons, plotting on oil profits

[Chorus]
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though

My brother said some racist shit a couple of years back
Then the blacks came out and started to protest and crap
And I knew I'd have little hope, cause all of sudden
The blacks got together and started to register to vote
But thank God for computers and them helping
Cause we got the last names of every single felon
We programmed the computers to find the names that were the same
Whoever came up couldn't vote on election day
Way to go Jeb, really great strategy
We got rid of the majority of black families
And I'm not even talking about Dade County
The expired military ballots are bogus, counted
I'd like to thank my cousin and the help from my pappy
My cousin owns Fox and it made me very happy
He told the entire world that I won
Before the votes were being done counted
And even though Gore had more, what matters in the end
Is the Supreme Court, and those are my dad's friends
So thank you very much, and please remember
If you don't vote, I'll see you back in November


[Chorus]
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'

See I don't know why I gotta go and creep around
You've seen me and my penis
Not used to having to sleep without somebody
And I've been chugging alcohol and I'm leaving now
And I don't wanna go home alone tonight
I was freaking with some hunny named Lisa
She was squeezing alpha Puerto-Rican Diva
Weaving her hair with the cleavage out
Expedin' by the V
She's flashing the keys to go peep the house
And then my phone rings, it's my girl on the line
It's like, I don't know what the hell to do
It's like women like this are seldom and few
I'm fucked up in the club with a blunt and a butt
But my love will hang up if I tell her the truth
See, I can be a selfish dude especially when
I'm off a blunt and a brew but
But she's so sexy, now let me spend the night
It's like help, either way I'm screwed
Get it?
See if I lie, I got my conscience to deal with
But if I go wakin' up in the ride then I'm gonna get
To grind with a fine Puerto-Rican Brazilian
But is it really worth it? I don't know
I gotta ask myself that question
Booty's truly an option
But it's not gonna suit me like my girl Evan

No more dollar drinks so she
Followed me with the house keys
And I know what I'm doing is wrong
Hoping that you were the one
But out 'til like two in the morn
With nobody you wanna know
It's comforting to know you're home
When I'm out on the road
I know you're lonely though
Or maybe got some flow of your own
In the looking glass, you shake your ass
I sat back and I watched
Then I took your hand, and we both danced
While thinking of the thoughts
It might've been the circumstance that hurt
This man - I'm a circus act at most
Nobody's perfect girl, it's a perfect world
But we don't have to know
And I'm not trying to justify it
But I might try to simplify it
One touch and I'm mesmerized
So I mess around in disguise
Flesh to the eyes, test to the lies
Sex gets my vote unless...

Yo
The first time I heard Digital Underground I was in the first grade
My homie, Lace, brought it over and he dubbed it on a mixtape
I would do the Humpty Hump and perform to his verses
12 Years later, I learned that Shock G and him were the same person
I loved Hammer I can't front he taught me how to dance
Along with Bell Biv DeVoe I had Jay-O's and a pair of zebra pants
But this was the foundation
What would come to be a life long passion, journey and drive an MC
Some people ask me what it means
I dont know where to start
Its the deepest connection between my soul and my heart
When I first stepped to do a cypher in a jam at the park
I got served No for real I got served
But see I learned something observed others
And watched an urge hungered
Verse studier earned a turn on that block
I dont care who you are or where you're from or what you believe in
But if you love Hip Hop I bet
Its more or less for the same reason
This is it when you spit you exist in that moment
And if you're sick with that gift you then rip it when you perform it
Then all the shit that you live begins to lift off your shoulders
And the audience well they get to experience where your soul is
The most amazing feeling rocking a crowd to your anthem
To the front to the back with their motherfucking hands up
Cause I'm an MC won't be the first won't be the last
Just another B-Boy and I'ma die in my stance

Dont put your hands down Keep that shit up

It goes front back front back I said front back
To my people you know it
It goes front back front back it goes front back
Okay, bring it down

[Verse 2]
Now I don't know if it's the clothes, the hoes or the cars
That make people rap like they're trapped inside these bars
This shit ain't complicated, man, just be who you are
Too busy searching for the light, missing the fact that you're a star
Now who's got passion? Stand the hell up
'Cause I wanna hear somebody rapping who's got it inside their cuts
Now you can get intricate, displaying your fancy cadences
But if you're not speaking the truth you might as well not be saying shit
I said ""Who's going to teach the kids?""
You wanna blow up and get famous so you can get some new rims
All the money in the world can help you look like a star
But money can't buy you the heart to go and put inside your bars
And I like nice shit too
Believe me, I got a closet full of Nikes and whole bunch of Velour suits
Fitted white Tees and an Icy earrings like the whole youth population of hip-hop
But look beyond it when I record to these beats
But if I don't speak me
What's the difference between my lyrics and what you hearin' on MTV
People fear that if they're steering away from the mainstream
Then their album won't sell, well, I could give a fuck
I'm just gonna freestyle and spit what's inside my gut
And if you want to you can go and label me conscious
But just remember there's a kid at a bus stop beatboxing
Whose life's will be affected by what's inside of his Walkman

If you got a pen and a pad put your heart down

Ladies and gentlemen, introducing
The ""Penis Song""
(Oh no, he didn't) (Honkey dick)

[Chorus 1]
This is my penis song
I wish that I had a bigger shlong
One that was quite a bit more thick and way more long
One of those porno king kong dongs

[Verse 1]
Haha, check it out, yo, uh
I wish my dick was bigger, yep, I can admit it
I'm above average on inches but I wanted damn double digits
If I had a big ol' cock what would I do?
I'd probably go to Florida and show it to Trina and screw
Get butt naked and start streaking at my school
And get arrested but at least the girls would be impressed
With my third leg and, and then I'd go to a keg and
Do a keg stand, get drunk and do the running man
With no clothes on just to show off
""My dick's bigger than yours when mine is cold and soft""
Haha, oh yeah
I forgot that's not really the cock that I have
I went out and party-bagged 'em and quickly opened the package
And it fit me like Kriss Kross's old school starter jackets
Tryna convince myself like, ""Size doesn't matter
Anyways I'd probably just put it on backwards,"" I mean
I know that God made us all different and special
But shit did he really have to invent lopsided testicles?

I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you never see me skinny dippin' in August
Always walkin' around with my hands in my pockets
Tryna pump blood into my guy Alfonso
I mean, goddamn I don't think you girls understand
I've had a complex since that song Short Short Man
And even though girls have told me that I'm big
When I watch a porno I feel like a little kid
I mean, let's take Ron Jeremy
Now if a girl sees him she'll compare him to me
And every MC in hip-hop has got a huge cock
Or at least talks about it in every song that they drop
I mean, shit
If I was really hung I'd make a whole album called Me and My Dick
With interludes of all the girls that I'd been with
And talk about my package and multiple orgasms
'Cause all that I see is that size does matter
We got Enzite, penis pumps, surgery to Viagra
But when it all adds up you can't really change it
I'm not a porno star, I just gotta face it
[Interlude 3]
You know, I mean, what can I do? Nothing, right? This song goes out to, like, all the, like, little bit above average dudes, to, like, the small dudes, medium dudes but all you big guys, man, stop [?]

Now, I don't know why this world is a trip
See, I just float by hoping that I can live
With a pen I'm so high, using this medicine
I got a little bit of it to give
Come on, hear me now
My momma says the trip inside of you gon' hear it child
We all got it, if you want it gotta get it out
I know you know what I'm talking about
See it's the music from the magic, got me on top of these clouds, come on
Keep it poppin' with my favorite song
There's no feeling like the city walking with my walkman on
It gets to me, giving me goosebumps and I'm gone
And when I die just make sure that I got my pen and headphones on
In good times and upsets
Rain, hail, beats, sand, heat, land, and a lot of damn sunsets
They say that you can never capture the moment
Photograph or record it, but I swear I can when I bump them
As I bear witness to existence, setting in the distance
For a sheer instance I become one with it
Dismeant up to ten when I listen like I was set on this mission
Places I've been when I with them
I'm feeling the most high when I got my pen and I'm scriptin'
No engines speakin as I enter religion
No crosses, pews, prayers, or repentance for sinning
Just the RCA jack, a sentence and a vision
Inside of the gut, time with the cut, right from the plug
That feeling that goes right into us
Instead of bump live, but with eyes wide shut
You got some fire and a lighter, I'mma fire it up
Depending on the month, sometimes I feel high with just pen and pad
If the gab, the light's within us
I can apply my touch on the mic stand and bust
To the whole planet, and my headphones on

I just get stressed when I try to understand it
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you can't plan it
It's always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it

[Verse 2]
Now, have you ever done hallucinogenics?
Children, don't get it twisted, I'm not reccomending
But it's not fried brains and hippies and kids jumpin' off buildings
It can be spiritual epiphanies and medicine
Now I first tried shrooms when I was 16
And the universe became more interesting
I began to contemplate my place in this landscape
And reflect on what it meant to be a human being
What I went through felt as though I dreamt it
Through my experience, became aware of my breath, then
Began to cultivate my art with the intention of the heart
Started to use my sentences as reflections
And what I saw was God was in all of us
And we'd all come to be interconnected
And all that was depended on all of us
And had effects like a domino when you let it
Go with the flow, that the universe holds
Understand that there's more than you expected
I don't do shrooms anymore cause I don't need to explore
All that I was looking for was was the present
[Hook]
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you can't plan it
It's always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you can't plan it
It's always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens

""I don't feel there's any point in trying to survive when people don't try to help me.""
""When we—we share a community, we should all be engaged and more involved in each other's wellbeing, you know?""

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now everyday that I walk outta my building
I see homeless people sleeping and chillin' on the steps to the apartment that I live in
I’m not saying everyone’s a victim
But the people that I live with treat ‘em more like villains than actual citizens
I walk past a man laying in his own vomit
He gets his food and his garments by digging in the garbage
I beg your pardon, Mr President, but I'm a resident
And since you've been in office I haven't seen any evidence
Of things changin', we go into Iraq and attack
When we got people on the streets without a roof over their back
We've come to accept the homeless as part of our landscape
The money the government wastes could provide them with a safe place
To eat and sleep, but we cease to see
That our own country is based around war, power and greed
We got families on the street with nowhere to go
And the concrete's the only place they have to call home

[Chorus 1: Don-P]
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home
Feeling you're all alone
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home (Yo)
Feeling all alone

Now every face tells a different story, a different message
Now how can we judge the book when we don't know the beginning?
We don't know what turned 'em to the bottle, or started injectin'
We just see dirty clothes and another bum beggin'
We don't see the kid who was an addict the second that his mom was pregnant
Or the young girl who was raped and stripped of everything sacred
Who now stands downtown walkin' on the block pacin'
'Cause the only way she knows how to make it is gettin' naked
We don't want to face it, and it being the fact
That the government created the ghetto and gave it crack
To oppress immigrants and blacks, and give 'em more of a setback
Like the last five-hundred-years wasn't enough to accomplish that
Now look at the homeless rate, and tell me to my face that race
Doesn't play an intricate part in your fate in the United States
Now think about your home, and the place that you sleep
And the homeless, who only have the concrete

[Chorus 1: Don-P]
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home
Feeling you're all alone
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home (Yo)
Feeling all alone
[Chorus 2: Macklemore]
Now if you wanna see change then throw your ones in the air
You think the system that we're living in is not fair?
You wanna see change? Then put your ones in the air
Now point it to the ground, 'cause change starts right there
Now if you wanna see change then throw your ones in the air
You think the system that we're living in is not fair?
You wanna see change? Then put your ones in the air
Now point 'em to yourself, 'cause change starts right there
'Cause change starts right there

[Outro: Don-P]
The streets are cold, all alone
In the city
Where you lay your head is your home
What a pity
People pass you by with a glance
Say you're filthy
But they don't know they pain you've been through
No, not really2Embed"

Yo, I'm getting older now, 23 years old
And half of me just wants to make the move and go and settle down
The other half's like, ""Hell no, you better mess around
Don't let me down, especially when you got an album coming out""
When I first saw you I'm like, ""Aw shit
Goddamn it, look what God did, Hail Mary Jesus""
Three years later I'm sitting in our apartment
Thinking about all the places that my heart's been
I mean it's crazy right, this is maybe wife
The one that found me in a drought, pulled me out, and made me right
Through the ups and downs we stuck it out and now you're leaving town
Another couple thousand miles south, which leads to crazy fights
And I don't know how to deal with it
I gotta be real with ya
Each day I get filled with the
Feeling of realer love, we wanna continue it, but
This ain't the same old love song
'Cause we been through the depths where all the trust is gone
For months on end all we have is phone calls
But you know what makes it worth it?
To watch someone progress, to have them watch you
Someone that you respect and value and cry to
It's something so comforting, 'cause it could bring so much truth
But then magic can be stagnant and the relationship doesn't move
The commitments to yourself, and that you're always learning
To acknowledge you're both perfect and still wanna keep working
To progress as a person, but as an individual entity
And then come together as a unit but still maintain that identity
It sounds so elementary, but it's so complex
The most delicate balance to get away from attachments
But it can work, I'm attempted, nah, we're living it
To keep defining and redefining what love and commitment is
Sing that, come on

Yo, just working on dependency
Sometimes the thing you love the most in this world, you just gotta let it be
It hurts to have to set it free
And if it does or doesn't work we both know that it was meant to breathe
Can't hide from experiences
And there's so many people out there in this world we're gonna find interesting
It's only a matter of time before that right connection
Thousands of miles away, what you expect?
You see I'm wondering where are you
Tearing the label off of a beer as I'm sitting at this bar stool
You would tell me not to call you
To never use you as a fall through, to sit with my emotion
But the lump in my throat builds as the heart rips open up
And not even your voice alone can shift to go and close it shut
So I just let it flow through me
Feeling lifted from the spirit like the bag in American Beauty
And if your life truly flashes in front of you
When you die just know the best time of my life has been loving you
I love you, you know
Let's get 'em, come on

Yo, remember high school?
With that dude who thought he was so cool
Walking around like everybody should know who, he is
Like he was some superstar in the biz
Just because he had a Japanese car and some rims
It's silly ain't it?
It goes to show how tainted
Cause these hoes jocked him like he was somebody who supposedly made it
And I'm not hating man, the dude was my boy
But I watched girl after girl get their world destroyed
Now when a squirrels a squirrel and a nut is a nut
And I seen a lot of girls cut so they could get stuffed
Or at least be cool in the high school soap opera
Cause kids do anything to be popular
Guys get their hair cut so girls can jock ya
But if girls get with guys their known as a trick
But if a dude does the same shit, he's known as a pimp
And the question is: Is there really a difference?

[Verse 2]
Remember that girl in high school that everyone wanted to hit?
She wore them dresses with the bestest breasteses the size of Texas
And she was the queen of estrogen, White, Black, Puerto Rican, and Mexican
And she sat next to you in third period
She powdered her face but her skin had no flaws
Her tits looked like she wore three wonderbras
Thank God for that math book you put on your lap to
Cover up your jeans when your dick got hard
I mean she was amazing I'm not playing
You were like 14 but she was still the kind of girl you wanted a baby with
And I could tell the way that she would rock them pants
That a lot of dudes hit it but she wanted a chance
You talked to her, but she gave you the shoulder
She was the type of girl that was cold as Boulder
She'd only mess with ya if you drove a Rover
What I push? Well fuck it
Let's just say a bucket. OK
Anyway one day I rocked a show
And I see her right there chilling up in the front row
Next time I go to my math class for sho' she's talking about
""Hey yo bro, I didn't know that you flowed
Hey yo what's up with that CD? Maybe we could eat lunch after P.E
Ah hee hee hee hee hee""
If it's the mic you rock, the car you got, the 3-pointer you shot that get's the girl then she's probably a breezy

Remember high school with that girl you can't remember? (Who?)
The one that never stuck out, she kind of looked like whatever
Kinda nerdy, never came to the parties
She went home after school and never really chilled with nobody
She was in one of your classes and used to wear glasses
With braces that accented her pimples that weren't really attractive
But she was good in Spanish and let you cheat off her answers
But when you'd see her in the hall you would walk right past her
You acted like a bastard and never treated her right
Cause her body wasn't buckling and her face wasn't tight
Well guess what
See that beautiful girl with the big butt
Standing at the incense shop reading the poetry that she writes
That's her. Oh hell nah, I know that's not her
Wait minus the pimples, the braces, and a lot less nerd
Take off the overalls and the baggy sweatshirt
Yeah there she is, reading about her words
Shit, man I'mma go spit some game
Wait I see some resemblance from like way back in the day
I rememeber that girl that only liked me cause I rhymed
And now I'm really only talking to this girl cause she looks fine
Back when she was normal I wouldn't give her my time
Shit that's crazy

The other day, me 'n XP opened for Souls of Mischief
I'm like ""Yo, let's get on some angry MC showmanship and hit 'em""
Rocked all the cocky songs and not too many soulful lyrics
Even a couple dissin' women callin' 'em ""groupies,"" ""hoes,"" and ""bitches.""
Got off stage, and I'm like ""Yo, I know that we killed it,""
Ran into a familiar face, a female who comes in and supports us
I said ""Peace!"" She said ""Wait! Let me talk to you for a minute
I know it's none of my business, but I wasn't impressed by your performance.""
I said ""Word? Shit, I love feedback and criticism.""
She said ""I miss the passionate spirit, your political vision
Quite honestly I wasn't offended by those references to women
But you're only continuing society's conditioning.""
It hit the heart of me
I told her that this was part of me
I stand up for human rights, and treat others how I would wanna be treated
But every song can't be seepin' with freedom
'Cuz the other side of me is sexist then people will feel that I'm preachin'
""Everything's peace and love?"" uhh, that's somewhat misleading
Because this world is fucked-up and I'm a pro-duct to what I'm seeing
Not to justify, but just to touch on my being
I learn from these verses and my purpose gets surfaced with demons
Now I am sexist, I'm prejudice, I put that in my music
She said she heard that perspective, but before she turned around
She said ""We have a flame, your fire's ignited with sound
Are you building the empire up, or using your fire to burn it down?""

Consumption, contradiction. I'm conflicted with being a hypocrite

Now one thing that I've always struggled on
Is how to incorporate drugs and alcohol into my music outside of sober songs
'Cuz on that perspective, that's all over my records
But the other side isn't represented unless it sessions with XP
How can I admit that I love to smoke weed
Knowing the kids are listening and many of them look up to me?
Not to say that I'm a role model, but I know that words are power
And if I condone bottles and chronic, I am sending out the
Message ""It's okay,"" hey I believe that it is
Chronic can be medicine, but it's all about your relationship with it
See I'm either off in the wagon riding and everyday with the spliff
Constantly looking for a balance but habit turns to addiction
And hip-hop music and weed: they're inseparable
So MCs that don't smoke or drink, talking about it, to me, seems questionable
It proves how much people just want to be accepted
And not seem straight-edge to their audience, so keeping it real is neglected
'Cuz when I'm smoking, I wouldn't wanna bump a song like this
Put on some Dev and break out the Swishers, and a bong and some licks
See that's a part of me too
And I know that I would make more money if I wasn't as true
To all the struggles of the blunted consumption I'm going through
Make music for the party, and the people support you
I burn Brother Ali and buy 50, what does that say to you?
Bring it back around
Am I building the empire up or using my fire to burn it down?

This is for my soldiers
Not my soldiers that chose to be soldiers
But the soldiers that were forced to be soldiers

Now what’s the trouble, you scared of being a human?
If the truth is a tool I double dare you to use it
Hit the booth and I’m well aware of what I’m doin’
If I confuse you with the humor I’m preparing them for the movement
I’ve been alive before and every person’s got a purpose
Most don’t observe it or know what they’re striving towards
Only you can light the torch
Cause you won’t survive the war if you don’t know what the fuck it is you’re fighting for
Most of us won’t open up and trust the inner source
Combined with being tempted to just accept it
But don’t twist the message, if you must think of my support
Sometimes you gotta pull off the tees and get on some left right left shit
I worked with 80 soldiers hooded behind locked doors
Forced into a war, an entrance with no exit
Before they could grow up, just some crazy soldiers
Arming them with crack and guns, in essence, defenceless
Yup, my man rapping, charismatic and handsome
In his own words 21st century panther
Thirteen-years-old gets into a fight
Decided to steal the kid’s bike
Cops come and he ends up in hand cuffs
Two months in and now he’s caught in the trap
Got out, got caught with a gat and crack
Now what do these people think
Juvenile life like that he grew up in a room with a mac
And he’ll be policed until the day he can legally drink

I wish it was a dream but it seems too vivid
There’s blood on these streets I can’t see who’s is it
I should probably mind my business
I said tell me what’s the matter with this picture
I wish it was a dream but it seems to vivid
There’s blood on these streets I can see whose is it
America wants me to mind my business

Now if you contain anything in a cage
Its natural tendency is going to try to be escape right?
When these kids get out of the gates and face life
If you raised them as a criminal what do you estimate they’ll behave like?
The ratio is 80 something percent of kids who get locked up again or go straight to the pen
And that’s strange right
It’s a snowball effect, and they wanna see you again
So they can make sure that America remains white
Yup, going back on that race shit
Most of the neighborhoods are like cages they try and escape and
If the American dream is to make it
It’s obviously blatant that if you’re left with nothing, what do you do?
Take it
Attempted Murder was the case
My man got beat up, stomped in his face
Ask George Bush what you do when you’re attacked
His boy went and let it spray, hit one of them in the leg
Now George you can relate
Remember Iraq, or was it Afghanistan? Just ain't funny
Proving sometimes you gotta take something to make money
My man’s homie snitched and said that he planned to hit
And he’ll be out when he’s 46
Now ain’t the game something
The soldiers follow the same orders
The generals are Crips folk and south of the border
Nortenos and bloods
Now is it a kid with a gun or the system he lives in that has his disorder
If there’s a fiend on the block, somebody’s serving em
If there’s a teen with a Glock, there’s a cop looking to turn 'em in
If you have something I want, there’s somebody murdering
Since 1492, where the fuck do you think we learned it from

The page, it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways

[Verse 1: Xperience]
Instead of staying the same
'Cause I see better days ahead of me
I paint them on the page
Then I save them for the rainy ones
When anger and the anguish want to hang around
I say 'em outloud and complain to them
I figure I'm made to live and haven't gone that far
But I made it here, so if there is a God I give thanks to him
Then I take the pen and make amends again
The only way I know to repent
I know somebody's listenin'

Dear God, I'm so thankful for you keeping my plate full
The struggles, heartache, pain, the progress and the breakthrough
Every single track has made who I am to this day
Through this page is the only way to paint you
But lately it's like my soul feels counterfeit
Scared to pick up the pen to see what the hell might come out of it
So God, grant me the serenity without giving me the christening
Because all I ever needed was a beat and people listening

[Hook]
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways
'Cause the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page, it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up (Good Morning)
I'm gonna change my ways

[Verse 3: Xperience]
Instead of rotting away and plotting my grave, hiding in a bottomless shame
I found a way to fight my way out and see the light of day
And proud to say I took the safe route, but there's a price to pay
They like to keep my name in they mouth and tell lies on me
What you see is what you get, truth in the flesh, homie
You can do the rest, I'm through with trying to prove myself to you
I'll see you when you wake up, hope the feeling is mutual
[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Now for artists and musicians, you see the target's to listen
To the heart and then script it, with no margin, no limits
To make to pain, strengths, sun rays a part of the picture
And convey it in every shade and take it farther and vivid
They're gonna say what they say, to barge in the vision
And whatever the DJ plays, they market the gimmick
But I've got a path to follow and the longer the distance
I realize I'm already awake
I'm just starting to live it
My language

[Hook]
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways
'Cause the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page, it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways4Embed"

[Intro: Macklemore]
Check it out, yeah

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
The risk of blunderin' to rap in front of a couple a hundred kids knowin' my licks is humblin'
Spit the struggle of an addict to puff in them swisher split but the light that was lit, I quickly run from it
I turn away from that source inside
A slicker for happiness, thinkin' I need a store to buy it
Recordin's priceless but look at how important ice is
I thought rhyming was forever now it's imported diamonds
My point is eyein', music that's absorbed my life an'
You glorify guns, they bust sex and drugs of course they'll try it
And I can't even front like I didn't, cause I still do and that's why I'm spittin'
I'm lookin' for this thing called moderation that I heard some found
The only problem with drugs is sometime you gotta come down
I lived half my life numb and bud drowned
And rum, vodka, how many bucks have I spent on dubs now?
I'm 23, look at my lungs now
The amount of THC from the swish of sweet blunt count?
I can't even conceive, that's why I run wild
In these streets like I was 13, like fuck now
I make that revolution music, but not for the army
A reminder against the vices that harm me
Cause I could never see how affected my lung is
You only get one shot at life, no ad-libs or punch ins

Now, my mom once told me that we're not finished products, only
Authors of a book, and the object is to write it slowly
This is my last 16, I'll go for it
Four years in college and this is all I have to show for it
I said, this is my last song, so here's my passion
18 tracks, each one an attempt to take my mask off
Woo! The oral tradition's been passed on
While she ride the rhythm to the points that I'm a blast off
And as the music absorbs through
Me to be like Don P. hearin' beats from my dorm room
XP, It's been a joy and blessin'
My boy 'til my death and my Step-Cousin with voice from heaven
Yes, Budo! It was you who produced through
I am connected and now our friendship is the truth, dude

In life, seven going symphony
I orchestrate my music willingly
Like emus? making history
Mentally we’re manipulated by the music industry
It’s conference, chivalry, creativity, lyrically step up and take a stand
But if you over-stand linguistically then represent
For it is evident that the dead president is taking our culture out of its element
And my testament is to get it back, take propaganda and insert facts
Starting a positive revolution within the rap, clash, and that’s vain called
Jewelry ice and money and women don’t mean a thang
It’s a shame what we listen to, “In actuality it’s hurting who?” Me and you
Originating a negative that America looks up to
And we think it’s cool, but in reality it’s whack
And the media associates hip hop with commercialized rap
I’m taking it back to the positivity, provocative productivity
Rebelling against this industry
Drop if it’s hot, drop it if it’s pop
Doesn't pop and lock? Then it really ain’t hip hop
So don’t cop it
But this is the only way that we are going to stop it
If they don’t make a profit then there won’t be a market
Do the math, listen to the music that comes from the soul
Most quote, unquote MC’s are in it strictly for the bankroll
And have no mind control
Behold, when the trend ends, they get back
Silly bitchin' for the check, what the fuck did you expect?

Welcome to the culture
If you don’t know it’s called hip hop
If you knew, sorry for the review, but it looks like a lot forgot
We bomb cities, pop and lock
Spinning our records as we rock
To the beats on the streets kicked over a beatbox
Intellectual evolution
Consciousness distribution
Substitution soul speaking sound service is my solution
Strictly b-boy
No decoy hot boy stuck in irrelevance
Hip hop prolonging the art
Bringing it back to the elements

[Verse 2]
Let’s get back to the basics
Step one, knowledge of self
If you don’t know yourself you won’t be content with evil wealth
Many seek to find a peaceful state of mind
Assuming that finances verbalize, but you walk the line?
Ignorance is bliss
Surprise
So if you are stuck on manatary? Monetary mersany?
You will never learn that the best things in life rest eternally
I don’t put music out of my purpose, and my service
To my mental, well folk, without it the other steps are worthless
Shining, shimmering light, despite counterclockwise movements
So I listen to my intuition and let my eternal ways, and release my inking in fluent congruent fashion
Pardon the provocative exceeding ear drum boundaries, I’m lasting
So the fakes get crossed out because we don’t need ya
I’m second cheese wannabe MC’s end up taste-testing for Velveeta
Y'all some bitch-made
Paper-weight, deteriorate
On the couch ejaculate
I got to regulate
Innovate, operate, and never do shit
All you talkers make me sick
Thinking that smoking weed on your couch is gonna get you a record exec. on yo dick, and
Get you a deal?
Look in the mirror and honestly tell yourself that you are Keeping it real, but you lying
Listen to your heart and hopefully you will learn
That your actions speak louder than your words

The drum of the heart was the start
The civilization to embark
So our art’s origin is the drum
Our cerebrum is our brain
Our body is the temple
And you treating that right, yo that’s essential to yo mental
And I wanna preach, but I figure MC’s have the power
And if they have the talent they can reach ya audience
Without displaying cockiness
Hopefully you gain insight to real but demo bumping' progress Of the occupants
Because this is rhythm
If it comes from the soul
Your skills shall unfold
And the truth shall be told

Man, I'm loving life right now
I'm just looking out the window and just thinking

I mean this is the Pacific Northwest

""I'm gonna go here, I'm gonna go there""
I mean go ahead and travel
But just know
There ain't no place like the fresh coast, man

I was born on this earth, a child of the sun rays
Lifted by the hands of the sand and
Ever since the first day, I saw a doorway
And eventually made my entrance
Embarked on what happened to become my fortress
The first sentence. In the ever glowing paragraph
Using words to communicate with the life forces that I call my mom and my dad
A continuous family tree
Blossoming with me in the middle of fate, destiny, and reality
As I proceeded to grow I met my love on the radio
And knew that I had to be down with the Knights of the Round Table
At the age of thirteen, began to work out my flow
Met Mind Control, and a year later pulled the sword from the stone

This is the land of the enchanted
Mesmerizing beauty surrounds this planet that’s taken for granted
I see it every day
As poison unfortunately is force-fed upon the face of the human race
Leading to the decay
Of this ground that we walk on
As an organic emperor I have started on a continuous thought song
The melody’s moisture rains in my brain
His mind remains soothed by the way that this music plays
Feeling the force of the melodic texture
Harp strung, heart sprung
Toward a medieval adventure
Those inspired can attend a lecture
Kings of the continuous Casper? From now until November

Feeling freedom, talk as I walk
Embark on the meadow of thought with the plot
On the future that changes, my reason rearranges
Leaving lackadaisical phases conquering the mazes
Of confusion
Mind over matter
Climb the ladder
Find and gather
The knowledge of life
A plot to music, and use it
Fluent with my words
Curve, turn, swerve, urge, and learn

Concentrate on your mindstate
Spit licks and practice

So I was relaxing at the spot
And some dude came through and was like, “Yo, you got flows?!”
I was like, “Of course”, and I asked him if he rhymed
And he was like, “Only when I’m off this sizzurp!”
I love to rap, I don’t even care if you’re whack
You got, flows and a beat, we can do that
He was like, “Okay, but you go first"", so I spit an unedited
Spontaneous improvisational verse, and we were chillin'
Then this fool grabbed the mic and was like
“Yeah, I be killin', stackin' millions, eatin' children
Fuck a slut bitch”, I interrupted his ignorant ass
And said, “Unless you’re trying to sound like Brother Lynch
On shermstick, that the microphone you need to pass
You don’t got a Bentley, I just heard you talkin' about your bus pass”
He said, “Fool you don’t know me!
I’m crazy, blood! I'm a North End rider, just ask my homies
I jack white boys like you” I replied
“You’re white too"", he said, “Honky, I wear FUBU!
I’ll fight you! Let’s go head up!”
I told him, “My man slow your roll, peep the flow and just wake up”

So I was talking to one of my teachers and they asked me what kind of music I made
And I said, “Hip Hop, I’m an MC and I make beats.”
And he laughed and he’s like
“Mm, you must be like Eminem.”
First of all, hip hop is my life
My culture, my blood, and me being white
Doesn’t have anything to do with my skills
He said, “Oh you’re like Will Smith, Puff Daddy, dollar dollar bill bill?”
Nah bro
Never associate me with Eminem, bling-blingers, R&B singers
I’m just sendin' out words that the youth can relate to
So they can stay faithful
Themselves they regulate when ignorant people degrade you
You should respect one another, you’re a teacher
And still haven’t learned you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover
He said, “Oh I’m sorry brother, calm down homie, don’t bust a cap in me, word to your mother.”
I tried to help my teacher see the light
But ignorance leaves people in the dark seeing only black and white
I looked him in the eyes and told him straight up
""You can’t teach if you don’t listen, open your eyes and just wake up""

[Verse 3]
So I was at the bus stop kicking a beatbox
And started conversing with some lady about music
And she asked me if it was true that
“All people have guns, smoke blunts, and drink forties in hip hop?”
So I told her
“Don’t believe everything that you hear
The news associates acculturate violence and fear
Fear extorts fear
Hip hop is universal
A positive outlet with energy flowing through the circle expressing souls without rehearsal
A conscious movement in tune with
The mental physical spiritual side of the music
It’s about love
Unfortunately, it’s stereotyped as a culture that’s based upon thugs
Hip hop is not about guns
And like all cultures, yes some hip hop heads do drugs
That’s not even relevant
In moderation, drugs can actually open eyes and expand the elements
I’ve come closer to my ancestor’s remnants
Scripting my life through the force of their spiritual presence
I use my lyrics as the evidence
You question hip hop’s drug use?
You should be questioning the President’s

Out of the womb I slipped
Between two vaginal lips
Pushed to the light of a sight
A fetus into a child
In the spring of the suns
But not the wet 'n' wild
Journey conceived
My fathers sperm giving my mother a seed
Implanted it in the ovaries
Of eternity and entity
Organism in the system of creation
Sperm swimming in the lake
Fluids that make
Being in the congruent state
Through movement i was able to generate
Enough energy to surpass fate
And become part of human race
Waiting for the cervical canal to dilate
Silently, silently searching for a trace of a base
That I can call my own
And aware my surroundings built under my creators
Sanctuary was my home
Binding with this life with force I would twist my body
Communicating with my mother pounding on her uterus
With my underdeveloped kick
The pulsation was my snare
The moment we share was rare
One breath, one life, one love
Push came to shove
I didn't want to budge by the force form above
Let me know, it was the time to go, told me so
A baby boy
With the the ovum of the X and Y chromosome

Knew my origin, the question that others took for granted
Don't forget where you came from
From the Fallopian tube
From the flesh of your mother's breast
You used to hang from
We got a nation held to ransom
Killed in selfish ways

Let's start the planning of enhancements for our grandsons
Offsprings, daughters bending Marauders and handguns

Good evening fellow earth people
Tonight I would like to take you on a trip
A trip with our minds
We're going to do something a little unique this evening
Start by just relaxing in your chairs and feel your consciousness
Feel where you are
I think most will find your self awareness
Somewhere up here in the cranium
That's where I dwell, that's where your center of awareness is
Self awareness, mind
Self awareness, mind

I felt her stare
A timeless glance surpassing infinity with beauty that I could not bare
This woman was rare
Ruminated infatuation with the essence of life encased in the shape of the ever match of the metronome of eternal bliss
These eyes are putting my hands around her hips
Dancing to the sound of two hearts synchronized by a kiss
I could not resist
But to look back and imagine us intertwined soul and mind holy divine love is by but I
Turned away
Becoming entrap I fear with the thought that my heart would be empty until the day that love would serenade
A song that was requested but was never played
A hopeless romantic with dreams of a soulmate that just been slain
So I said
Wanting to turn back had to turn back but the treasure that I Searched for my whole life
Would turn from gold to black
In an instant
My intuition forced me to go the distance
A-hundred-n'-eighty degree turn and hope with me and beauty With love hung from a rope as fate sculpt
Inside my ear
She waves the finger from her lap and silently mouthed the words ""come here""
Sweat poured on my face terrified from the daughter fear
And as i walked toward my companion I felt that my destiny was near

[Verse 2]
I approached my stranger
A modern-day Mary and the manger
A woman who by existing did mankind a favor
She sweet taste of life that death wishes it could savor
If beauty could be bought in the bible
She would be the thing for God's savior
Stood right in front of my face
I stuck my hand out to shake hers
She pushed it away and grabbed my waist in an embrace
It seemed like for hours we were in that pose
My hands explored the flesh of her back exposed by the revealing Dress that she had chose
To wear
We were rhythm I was the kick she was the snare
The feeling of knowing that this is it is so rare
She stroked her fingers through my hair
I felt the moment for what it was worth if I should spend the eternal harmony with my soul in the earth
She had given birth to creation filling my vows with the emotion of love combined with the constellations above I knew that I had found
My lifelong companion and after all those years I was alone
She grabbed my hand and whispered in my ear ""let's go home""

We made love
Possessed by the spirits enchant approaching human being Separate entities rejoicing as one

Flesh red
I touched her breasts
As a mother firsts touches her infant
Her body was my canvas and I painted an in-depth picture to distinguish
The feeling of being in-sync with
A companion that would never leave you
She spoke only to say ""I need you""
Every push was a pulsation of love's rejuvenation
She was freedom and I was a slave who had touched my whole life with liberation
Souls united under the force-field of trust
The orgasm was everlasting exceeding the depths of passion past the earth's crust
I had licked the juice from the sweetest nectar she returned the favor swallowing my soul the feeling that would last forever I remember
We held each other
Our bodies fit together like a missing piece of a puzzle
Our minds were one organism
Congruent
She got up to leave
""Hey yo wait I never asked you your name""
She turned around looked into my soul
And silently whispered ""Music""
Her name was Music !Embed"

Stay true to the truth and aware of the fiction
Love life for what it is, appreciate music and listen with open ears
Open eyes, see through the disguise

Meditation will take you high
Internal instinct can sync with social
Independent art, do your part, show support to locals
Use your trifocal, of your, third eye optical
Discuss meta of the universe, and philosophical
I know dependency seems impossible to break
But I know that from reading that mistake’s a clear mind state
Will elevate your being higher than any drug
Using moderation respect your breath and show love to the
Spirit above, and develop, a greater understanding of this life force
You call your own and embellish
The moment in search for your objective
I’m not preaching, just speaking on my life from my perspective

People tend to believe
On the basis of outside authority
Now in no way
In the science of mind do we ask you to assume any bidding
On the basis of outside authority
We ask you to think for yourself, to turn within
To experiment with the principles
And see
That they are demonstrable
They work, these writings, the scriptures, the sacred literature
A great (?)
Which is a source of an interior power by which to live
This is where it ties in with the faith
Because without the mystical element in any religion
The religion is sterile
It has no dy-dynamism
It isn't going anywhere, it isn't going to do anything for you
Because it's all, you're on a head trip
(You're on a head trip)
(You're on a head trip)
(You're on a head trip)
There are definite (?) we need to teach you
That make you live more comfortably in yourself
And with other people
Both in regard to the physical laws of nature
And to the psychological aspects of man
None of this scientific evidence means anything
And the breakthroughs and knowledge
Will still lead the West spiritually bankrupt
If we continue on our negativistic course
Today's answer, of course, rests in learning to effectively meditate
Coming to know the real purpose of life
To return to man's victorious spirit
Kingdom of heaven that is within (within, within, within, within)See Macklemore LiveGet tickets as low as $80You might also likeEmbed"

I exist as an explorer
Inspired from the winds enchanted, organic intent which caresses the aura of life and its winding roads
My home lies within the confines between the earth and the atmosphere’s ozone
A nomad on the roam I walk through the park
Acknowledging tree shades, light to dark, and my mark can’t be measured by miles or kilometers
My dreams I reach pinnacles of infinite heights, spiritual flights, cause’ i'm a wanderer
Possessed by an infinite journey
I go with the pace of my heart, my metronome is not in a hurry, life will surely lead you in the right direction
My soul is the compass of my intuition combined with reflections makes up my perception
I fly on the back of the sky, surfing on the thought plane
A matter inspired by my ancestors lives
So high, you don’t know where you are
I see the goose prairie with my family
Contemplating the stars on our backs
This is not about where you want to be, but where you’re at
And if you know that, and simply follow your own map?
Reality is an effect
So don’t believe everything that you hear
I ponder the thought of life in other unseen atmospheres
Anything out of the ordinary is considered weird
I try to stay clear of them Earthlings and their peers
Trying to find thoughts fountain
With a backpack and a notebook, I sit on top of the olympic mountains
Negative thoughts, I drown them ascending the trail
Winding around the curves of rock, plotting the scale of destiny’s surface
I will never fail
But my purpose is passed with worthless merchants and their distracting urges
I meditate to the medicinal music
Produced by the choir of tropical rainforest animals
Aware that I am only a student
The classroom of mother nature is the only witness
But life can leave you in an instant
And in the forest, it’s the survival of the fittest

Traveling, babbling to my self
Not knowing where I am going
I follow the river that is showing me direction
I expand over the universe and converse with heaven
Hovering over gravity’s dimension
Feeling freedom and justice
I metamorphosize
As a Native American
Hijack the Santa Maria and assassinate Columbus
Transcend my being back to present time
Sit on the porch with my parents and converse about life in the sunshine
Abort my mission for another expedition
Listening to birds cipher in tree tops as I beatbox to their wisdom
I stand on sacred ground that is engraved
For all the fallen journey men who pave the way for the present day
I stand alone with only my echo trying to act brave
Deciphering graffiti hit it by the Americans who decide the adventures in K
I puff on the peace pipe and watch the smoke sway
Aware that one day we will all pass away
But until that time
I will sit at the sea side
Unwind and continue to write rhymes
I’ll praise the most high
Without that spirit, life would have no light
The guiding force that shines bright
Giving travelers their navigational insight
With my walking stick, I spit licks
Hop over the present and watch the apocalypse erase this in the year 2006
Back to the 206
Hop on a bus to the 604
Like a show in fourth world
Having them screaming for more in the front row
Remain humble
I transport to the Grand Canyon with an eighth of 'shrooms concealed in my jansport
I report into my notebook as the remedy
Conserve my energy into painting the present
Remembering the memories
Always remain in forward motion
I hold the pen of eternity as I script to the sound of the waves formed from the ocean
Swim to the pace of the harmonic embrace
Tectonic plates shifting a subsonic rate in the Earth’s outer face
Changes like the seasons
I converse with Orca whales about existence and the reason why we fight our own kind when we all are breathing

From start till death do us part eternally through eternity I feel
From front rows at shows to family meals
Rides and automobiles
Which have manifested from taking spills on training wheels

Chorus X2

The energy flows from the cord to man
Women and children
Those who you have spent your whole life building a relationship with
Can end
As quick as a sandwich
Your trust melted
While drowning in betrayal and disbelief
You see who is really your friends
This world is full of selfish sapiens, slithering snakes
Who will take your trust, lure you with this bait
And sell you out for their personal sake
Built on hate, smiles and popular facades
Quick to stab you in the back with the object that you thought your relationship was built on
I got your back, and you got mine cuz we’re homies
Not need to greed and selfish needs
I question who really even knows me
Myself
And when I’m by myself
And I need someone plus myself
Will they sacrifice theirself to help?
Oh I see
If that’s the way it’s got to be
I guess I was a fool to assume that we’d be down until eternity
Oh I see
If that’s the way it’s got to be
I guess in the end the only person I can truly count on is me

I am happy to join with you today
In what will go down in history
As the greatest demonstration of freedom
In the history of our nation
I have a dream
That my four little children
Will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged
By the color of their skins
But by the content of the character
I have a dream today

[Chorus: Macklemore]
This the moment
January 13th has giving birth to the resurrection of the dream
Putting liberation first, 1929 until the present
The movement has begun
The infinite anthem of freedom will forever be sung
This the moment
January 13th has giving birth to the resurrection of the dream, yo
Putting liberation first, 1929 until the present
The movement as begun
The infinite anthem of freedom will forever be sung

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I have a dream, a dream deeply rooted inside of my soul

There's a light inside for you to hold onto

But I am giving my soul and dedicating my spirit to the realm of (?) With all the (?) philosophies

Seeking to find oneself as a conversation with self you must Discuss
