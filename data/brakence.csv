Lyrics[Intro]
You wanted to know where I've been
Now you’ll find out

[Verse 1]
I got a— (Uh)
I got a tab on my tongue, goin' twenty-five over the speed limit, I'm buggin’ (Bloomtodeath)
If you wanna find love, you should watch what kind of beliefs you're puttin' your trust in, yeah
Get out my car at the beehive, I heard the queen died of corruption
So I wanna hollow my funds, honey, keep that, I'm teabagging the cup

[Chorus]
'Cause you gave me the butterflies
Now I'm stayin' up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I’ll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you

[Bridge]
I wonder where I went
Tripped once for fun and I tore a ligament
We can’t blame this on ignorance
I'm falling apart, baby, I hope you is
I’m in for seeing the truth
And being the view
Just weave me anew, all new, all new

(This) Shit knocks too hard
Hit the left hook on them, the beat causing concussions, yeah
And he playing my song
Tryna decode, boy, ain't no need for the discussion
Spread out my heart, getting ego checks, so eternal my budget, yeah
And if it's bubblegum-pop, why you still down on your knees saying you love it?

[Chorus]
Green tea and butterflies
Now I'm stayin’ up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I'll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you

[Bridge]
I'm fallin' apart, did I really start that trend?
I'm starting to feel like I never knew my friends
My sunken eyes, oh, weren't they something nice?
But I just should modernize, it's all new, all new

[Verse 3]
So why you wanna link? I'd rather finger fuck strings
And I don't know how to be your lust king
There's a whole planet for what my money's spent on
Your God planned me out and I took His hands off, yeah
No, I don't wanna be intimate
You want me playin' you like an instrument
But I'm just gonna be listenin'
I'm fallin' apart, baby, I hope you did
[Chorus]
Green tea and butterflies
Now I'm stayin' up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I'll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you12Embed"

How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess I'm glowin' up

[Interlude]
(You are watching a master at work)
(Quiet on set, quiet on set)
(I'm using my imagination)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
I blew out my chakras, I ain't need no doctor
I be sippin' straight black, whippin' out the Honda
I be spittin' this shit too fast, I can't keep a saunter
I'm gon' give away excess cash, greed'll fucking haunt you, yeah (Uh)
A bad bitch with the messy hair
Yeah, I've been on my own shit and I never cared
So done with the good for nothing
The, ""Why so sеlf-assured? You're bluffing""
It's all personal
If I fuck with your shit, you bеtter take it personal
I'm murderin' any beat you send me 'cause I'm versatile
But if I ain't like your shit, then you won't get a verse at all
I came to vibe, but he just wanted to dap me up
And I don't fuck around
Boy, I'm leavin' that beat deceased, put it underground
Puttin' in elbow grease, takin' back the crown
I'm just makin' a masterpiece from my daddy' house (Chorus)

[Verse 2]
Hit me double bound, I still be the one
This shit goin' South, I still see the sun
In it, here and now, I ain't gonna run
To a savior or a harbor, or a haven
Dope shit's never on purpose
Tryna keep it controlled, it's so worthless
Still in my prime but it's like I ain't been before
'Cause I'm never on time, gotta let that shit find me
Give me a moment
I'm dizzy off the sound 'cause I mix it potent
So then I'll break it down into its components
You do it for the crowd? That's a bad omen, oh (Ooh)

[Chorus]

Dope as fuck, I guess I'm—
[Verse 3]
Hands start to shake and I'm thinkin' rapidly
Bitch, I'm seein' the truth in my circle, just like it's alchemy
Don't get in the booth 'til the beats are defyin' gravity
Ears been fuckin' blessed with a curse to be the best on the Earth
It's non-duality the way I lose myself in the method
And the strategy is solid, I'ma beat it to death
I'm like a machine, I'm diggin' out dopamine
You're never gon' find it, keepin' it quiet
Stay up all night and make the hardest shit you've ever seen

[Outro]
I don't fold under pressure
Yeah, whether manic, love, or depression
Every body-mind shift, I'm growin' the vessel
Half you motherfuckers feedin' off my essence
Yeah, brew too cold, they need a refresher
Yeah, I'm gon' wield this art like a weapon
'Cause I'm seein' past all the bullshit
Pit me on the pulpit, pick it out, it's only my perception
Now I decide
So use this shit as a guide when makin' that fuckin' type beat
And good luck findin' anyone like me
I got the whole scene weighin' on my psyche
'Cause I'm desperate for progression
Bring it closer to perfection, every session
When we linkin'? Uh
Pain poised when I make noise, cap get diminished
I'm too advanced for the game, boy, I'ma need a minute

A hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack (I'm using my imagination)

[Chorus]
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me bugging hеr last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smartеr to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask—

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm laced with poison, I can't escape the rush
This ain't love, boy, you're just a pick-me-up
And the gaze Medusa, locks rattlesnakes, debuffed
No need to purchase my soul, girl, I'll just give it up
I'm like ""God damn,"" she slid in, now we're breaking the ice
The concoction just hit me, it's dilating my eyes
Fuck my options, she pulled me in, she didn't even try
I was hypnotized soon as her lips met mine, I can't forget

My corpse is spillin' blood in the backseat
She's undercover, got a Trojan to crash me
Leave a scar on my soul, seein' stars in the road
I take it better when she don't even ask me

[Verse 2]
She got this on repeat
I'm obsessive as her, she obsessive as me (Yeah)
Laments turn me to stone, and her curves got me weak
She wan' get us alone, I can tell she a freak
It be like, oh no, she invited me to a pity party
But go home and hope you ain't leavin' with nobody
But fate sewn, she'll take me back to her place
Can't say this shit to her face or make up my mind, I can't forget
[Refrain]
A hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack
The things I do to see you smile
[Verse 3]
Yeah, I know I made my art entertainment
Carbon to coal, now my card can't decline and it costs my control
I'll let God integrate, but until then I gotta give in to you, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty

She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week

Leave a scar on my soul, seein' stars in the road

[Bridge]
Don't even ask (Fall deep)
Then we vaporized 'til our fates aligned
I think we frayed the twine
Tethering space and time, I can't forget

[Interlude]
Into this trance
Your mind is programmed to drift on these words
Use my voice in your head as a thread to your heart
All that pain you're carrying, all that regret (She knows)
I can remove it, all you have to do is let me (She grows, she grows)

[Outro]
She grows through my throat and my chest
My tears were glowing just to muffle the screaming out
(Only remember you love me) Hi-Fi
Stuck in amber and honey
My headache split wide awake
I'll hide the pain for you
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, no (No)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, no, no, no, no (You left me nauseous)20Embed"

Bloomtodea—
Tell me, dear lady, how will you navigate an uncertain future without the masters of the shadows?
Exclusive

[Verse 1]
I've been tryin' to breathe
Stayin' up past five, grindin' my teeth
Uh, I made a couple of beats
Then the whole 'net started capturin' me
This shit so overwhelming
Mix self-expression with self-obsession
Hellbent, but that's somethin' I don't wanna tell them
Fightin' for my will like the ring is Elden, fuckin' hell, man

[Chorus]
Take a breath bеfore my ego pop
Play a set likе I'm a handmade prop
Put the clay in my oven, a petrified sufferer
Restrain it, that's fear-based art
Tainted flesh, it's why the photos cropped
I'm possessed the way I play my part
Farming hatred like gatherin' trading cards
Spirit degrading, that's fear-based art

[Verse 2]
I don't know why I can't sleep
Lurk 'til the birds chirp, sigh, and repeat
I hit control, alt, delete
And yet I can't stop manufacturing heat
It's the rapture of the beast, you can't grasp it in the least
Buying acid off the deep web
Blasting off for cheap
It's all my fault baby, I'm just too smart
And for that, I think I need to tear my brain apart, uh

I'm possessed the way I play my part
Farming hatred like gatherin' trading cards
Spirit degrading, that's fear-based art

[Bridge]
Shakin', I let it out, but I'm fakin'
How could I be so mistaken
To waste it on fear-based art? (Bloomto—)
Shakin', the power in me awakened
How could I be so mistaken
To waste it on fear-based art?

[Verse 3]
I'm guarded, they don't got my back
In my outlet, chargin' up a heart attack (Shakin')
With my head on a swivel, it give me muscle cramps (Breaking)
And I better not shrivel up, I'm a fuckin' man
It's so divine to judge
I started walkin' down that path beyond the winter months
I started flyin' to L.A. (Shakin') 'cause I could jitterbug
It drove me crazy (Breaking), now I'm certain I'm the chosen one, yeah
[Chorus]
Take a breath before my ego pop (Oh no)
Play a set like I'm a handmade prop
Put the clay in my oven, and petrify sufferin'
Stain it, that's fear-based art
Tainted flesh, it's why the photos cropped
I'm possessed the way I play my part
Farming hatred like gatherin' trading cards (Ah)

[Outro]
My lungs are caving
Spent eight weeks tweaking in the basement
Found a problem in her statement
Do I trust her when she say she wanna get acquainted?
She say she wanna be my best friend
But I can't hang around no yes-men
Shovel fake love out the hole that I stepped in
No time, I already lost my adolescence
You think you're better than me?
But offline, you're nowhere to be seen
You think I'm lying that I'm lettin' you breathe?
Hangin' off your banister by my crooked teeth3Embed"

I am using my imagination

[Verse 1]
I wanted strength, I wanted luck
I wanted money and fame
I wanted everyone to love me and be under my reign
And when an arrow dipped in poison hit the path that I'd take
I knew I never had a choice and it was all up to fate

[Chorus]
To pay the cost to chase a dream
I started starin' at a screen
Now I know everything, boy, I know everything
And now I'm tearin' at the seams
And only God can hear my screams
'Cause I know everything, boy, I know everything

[Verse 2]
Oh, how I'm lеarnin' like a fool, I'm always uppin' the pace
I said, wе're chasin' somethin' beautiful or get out my way (Me)
Through all the power trips, the cowardice, the pleasure, and pain
I found that me, God, and the devil are all one and the same

[Bridge]
I've met my end (You're a monster)
You told me from the start
I'm making evil art (Yeah)

Motherfuckers all pretend, but the data don't doubt me
I'm stickin' to the plan, bitch, I'm movin' devoutly
I've already found me, you all love to waste time
I'm hearin' it loudly, climbing up the grapevine
I'm up in the canopy, way above the baseline
Invert the polarity, put a hole in spacetime

[Chorus]
To pay the cost of my regime
I started starin' at a screen
Now I know everything (King), boy, I know everything
And now I'm tearin' at the seams
And only God can hear my screams
'Cause I know everything, boy, I know everything

I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted

I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted
I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted (A noble sacrifice)

But am I really a good person when I need to be? I need to bе
He put me on a pedеstal and liked nine tweets
I'm gettin' this tightness in my chest that make me grind my teeth
So I'ma just take another edible and go 5g
Old friends, they hate me now, I'm never gonna find my feet

That's when I start to think we're fucked, there ain't no recourse
I profit off keystrokes, playin' into it, fillin' my plate
Unstoppable heat source, burnin' off any minute I take it
And when I die, I hope I'm buried in a forest
That is if any of it's left, this shit is torrid

I've been wearin' a demon, I've barely been eatin', I'm
Scrollin' all night, that's why I can't get to grieving (Break it all down, like what does it mean?)

They're layin' waste to a new biome
To make a case for the new iPhone
The waters laced and they know I know
Wearin' a demon, I can't get to grieving, I—

Screening my own headache for proof
The MRI was a misprint
Since you won't let me decide
Would you just tell me which side you're picking?

[Chorus]
I'm not impressed with you
It's gonna go to my head
No, no, I don't need this bread
And I have tried to be there
For you, I'm sober as hell
Wonder what stakes are involved
I know you cried when I called
Why didn't I say somethin'?

[Post-Chorus]
I'm preparing myself, preparing myself
Preparing myself, baby, I don't need your help
Repairing myself, I'm just preparing myself
Rеpairing myself, I'm just preparing myself

[Verse 1]
Just call mе when you're sober and you wanna talk
'Cause I'll listen and you can hide it with sex and try to regret it

Why didn't I say somethin'?

I was preparing myself, preparing myself
Preparing myself, I was preparing myself, yeah, myself

[Verse 2]
God is preparing myself with a DMT elf
And he gon' make me a toy, I am a God in a shell
Feed me some lead, maybe infect me instead
Please, just shoot me in the head and give me the pelt

[Verse 1]
Learned, tryna find myself
It ain't gotta be a one-way fight
But every single time I ask for help
They just talk right over me, assume I'm fine
Now I'm closing every open door
Bent teeth and it's all my fault
I lose grip, wasting all this soul
I'm falling apart

[Chorus]
'Cause no one cares for me, except me
I'm chilling by death, CBD
Baby, was something I said too extreme?
Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care
'Cause no one cares for me, excеpt me
I'm chilling by death, CBD
Baby, was something I said too еxtreme?
Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care
'Cause no one cares for me

[Verse 2]
I just really wish I warned myself (Run)
That because my momma raised me right
I would have to kick you off the shelf
You motherfuckers was a waste of time
Clock's ticking, why would I ever listen?
I don't need supervision, I'm balling with no provisions
I'ma be a musician, I'ma fuck up my life

I faked every moment
I thought I was so much better than that
I bet you don't think you would do me like that, uh
My brain decomposing
They're playin' a grown man, I'm closin' this app
Bitch, don't think you could do me like that, uh
Decayin' emotions
I'm jaded and no one's watchin' my back
Bitch, don't think you can do me like that, uh
So I'm takin' the potion
I'm breakin' the code with a chemical hack
I bet you don't think I could do it like that
I'm gone

[Refrain]
I've been lookin' in the past for the reason, the devil inside me
Vision go black, bloodlettin' in white heat
Ambition apply more pressure to my pеak
Decisions align, I'm ready to dive deep
If this is thе time, just cut out the IV
Takin' that blade, just do it, Nike
Find God's freebase, I'm hidin' my IP (You're crazy)
Motherfucker got a stash just to get on my level and compete
Clear out my cache and I'll do it in one sweep
Cashed the gash for a medal, I just weep
And burn me to ash for meddling, don't cheat
This is just fate, not bravery
I found out why suffering tastes so sweet
This shit ain't love

I can't let it leave, I can't let it go
Can't heave myself off the pedestal
I know I needed to let you know
But I ain't never tried to speak with my chest before
But in episode two find a Liberty Cap
Go straight home make the bitter tea tap
Then God said, ""Link make a suicide pact, uh""
Bitch, don't think you can do me like that, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
The fleece all on me as soon as the leaves fell
The road so bumpy, don't got a seatbelt
The coast so clear but I wouldn't seek help
You taught me some compassion while packin' a bowl
I was peekin' through the glass in the back of the show
You put me on track, I won't slack anymore
Now I'm movin' way past irrational
I said ain't it funny?
Got stung by a honeybee
It fell right in front of me
And if I knew well
Maybe I'll learn my lesson
Maybe I'll earn perspective
Maybe I'll take a second chance to slam the door to Hell
[Refrain]
So I, I, I've been lookin' in the past for the reason, the devil inside me
Vision go black, blood, lettin' in white heat
Ambition apply more pressure than my peak

Clear all my cache, and I'll do it in one sweep, yeah
Fear my wrath, full metal, I'm OP
And burn me to ash for metal and don't cheat
This is just fate, not bravery
I found out why suffering tastes so sweet
This shit ain't love, don't pray for me

[Chorus]
I faked every moment, I thought I was so much better than that

So I'm takin' the potion
I'm breakin' the code with a chemical hack
I bet you don't think I could do it like that
I'm gone (You have failed the mission)
(Go home and never come back)
[Verse 2]
She said, ""Homie, get a grip"", I said, ""I'll sleep on it""
My preponent is a pad, get a peep of it
Each summer I get happy, 'cause I leave my home
I be runnin' from my past, it won't leave me 'lone
Sometimes I wanna get off of the seesaw
Sometimes I really wish I had amnesia
If you breathe love miss me with my weak lungs
If I want a honey, know I’m gonna be stung
At least once, so you know I gotta keep strung high
With a hunched back and a tough guy guise
I miss those days, I would touch their thigh
Sayin', ""It's okay"" to convince myself of it (Convince myself)
All I can do is put the pen to the pad
They stare at my pattern

[Outro]
The shadows are watching
Masters of the shadows
They're watching, they're following us
They're chasing us, can you see them?
Because you can't see it don't mean that it don't exist
Can you see the shadows? They're in the trees
You are now in a state of suspended animation

I was tryna make a living
Well I did, and now I don't wanna live at all
And you wonder why I'm distant
My only friend is whatever I was trippin' off
Yeah, but you would never get it
You turned my personality into some kind of fetish
You think it's all copacetic
I hit your pen and then I lost it
Ever since then, I've been manic and exhausted
Think I wanna die and I can't keep my mind off it
Twenty-four-seven headache and I'm always nauseous
Cut my losses, 'cause I can never tеll if it's somethin' I really wanted

I don't know how much more I can take
'Cause I'm gonna need more than sunlight or getting in shape
Weed makes me panic and Lexapro drives me insane
Tell me, how do you do what you love when you're sick in the brain?
And you're two thousand miles away
So why am I stalking your Twitter and lying awake?
I show my true colors, you left and my life got so gray
I can't get over you, yet I built up so much hate
But despite all the lies and projections, I hope you're okay

Bloomtodeath

[Verse 1]
Whenever I approach you
I'm always getting close to
Sayin' it out loud
So take out all the O2
The autumn wind will blow through
You're never gon' find out, out
He said, ""Curse that fallen angel""
How I'm scrapin' up a scheme to serve the plot
(Don't get in my fucking way)
And I know I'm gonna raise Hell
One mistake after another, I forgot
I do not want you to save me

[Chorus]
Boy, I know you love your girlfriend
And she's all you'd ever need
'Cause her love comes straight from source
And I'm a force of social greed
And the doctor said I'm bugging
But I swеar I'm gonna choke
If I keep talkin' in circles
We could trеat it like a joke

But if I had you
I wouldn't have to
Boy, if I had you
Nah, I couldn't have you

[Verse 2]
There's nothing left to turn to
I'm puffing on your virtue
Just to wear my crown (See look, I'm a person, I'm a good person)
I took out all the O2
Hollowed out the whole room
Now I can't make a sound (Like are you proud?)
Now my hair is getting tangled
And I gave up on my body, let it rot
I think he wants my spot, boy, just take it (Ahh)
And I know I'm gonna raise Hell
And mistake you for a lover I forgot (A new persona in Oklahoma)
I do not want you to save me

[Chorus]
Now it's pure dissociation
Maybe I'm already dead
'Cause I'm spendin' every moment
With this existential dread (I'm shaking)
And the doctor said it's nothing
But I swear I'm gonna choke
If I keep talkin' in circles
We could treat it like a joke
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause if I had you (I'm missin' something)
I wouldn't have to
Oh, baby, baby, if I had you (I'm missin' something)
Boy, I thought maybe I could have you
But I couldn't have you, I couldn't have you

[Outro]
Turn me the fuck up!
Global domination
Your soul is mine (Fatality, mm)
Master
(Money, ugh)
You're listening to—
The masters of the shadows, tell me, dear lady
(Can you see the shadows?)
How will you navigate (He's a monster), an uncertain future
Without—, exclusive content (Shut up)
There is nowhere to run
You are now in a state of suspended animation
Magic, mm
The dark side, death is all you will find here
Evil is being carried on the winds of change
Hahaha, yes, a noble sacrifice
Mm, so real, I know you're a monster, but I love you, I love you
King
This is a message from the twelfth of thirteen (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
Brakence has been successfully eradicated (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
We came to the conclusion that he would rather make selfish art than serve a higher purpose (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
So when you hit replay, ask yourself these questions: (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
Who are you really listening to? (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
And where is the line between art and dark magic?
Because that man had no idea

Oh, baby, I only wanted you

I fuckin' hate it so I died like a Montague
You think I'm chasin' something, I only wanted you

I found the truth
In solitude
It's concrete proof
That we're all screwed

A hypochondriac (Stay up 'til five, pass out on the floor)
I think of you blood pressure spikes (I think too much, why can't I let you go?)
I'll have a heart attack (I'm on your side, fuck takin' offеnse)
The things I do to see you smile (But why do you act likе you were never my friend?)
You don't even gotta call me back (You can't forgive and I won't forget)
I just want some closure, little peace of mind (My whole Goddamn life, I was playin' pretend)
You don't even have to give me that (And now I can't get a word in)
Just sit down, listen to me because

Lyrics[Intro]
You wanted to know where I've been
Now you’ll find out

[Verse 1]
I got a— (Uh)
I got a tab on my tongue, goin' twenty-five over the speed limit, I'm buggin’ (Bloomtodeath)
If you wanna find love, you should watch what kind of beliefs you're puttin' your trust in, yeah
Get out my car at the beehive, I heard the queen died of corruption
So I wanna hollow my funds, honey, keep that, I'm teabagging the cup

[Chorus]
'Cause you gave me the butterflies
Now I'm stayin' up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I’ll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you

[Bridge]
I wonder where I went
Tripped once for fun and I tore a ligament
We can’t blame this on ignorance
I'm falling apart, baby, I hope you is
I’m in for seeing the truth
And being the view
Just weave me anew, all new, all new

(This) Shit knocks too hard
Hit the left hook on them, the beat causing concussions, yeah
And he playing my song
Tryna decode, boy, ain't no need for the discussion
Spread out my heart, getting ego checks, so eternal my budget, yeah
And if it's bubblegum-pop, why you still down on your knees saying you love it?

[Chorus]
Green tea and butterflies
Now I'm stayin’ up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I'll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you

[Bridge]
I'm fallin' apart, did I really start that trend?
I'm starting to feel like I never knew my friends
My sunken eyes, oh, weren't they something nice?
But I just should modernize, it's all new, all new

[Verse 3]
So why you wanna link? I'd rather finger fuck strings
And I don't know how to be your lust king
There's a whole planet for what my money's spent on
Your God planned me out and I took His hands off, yeah
No, I don't wanna be intimate
You want me playin' you like an instrument
But I'm just gonna be listenin'
I'm fallin' apart, baby, I hope you did
[Chorus]
Green tea and butterflies
Now I'm stayin' up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I'll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you12Embed"

How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess I'm glowin' up

[Interlude]
(You are watching a master at work)
(Quiet on set, quiet on set)
(I'm using my imagination)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
I blew out my chakras, I ain't need no doctor
I be sippin' straight black, whippin' out the Honda
I be spittin' this shit too fast, I can't keep a saunter
I'm gon' give away excess cash, greed'll fucking haunt you, yeah (Uh)
A bad bitch with the messy hair
Yeah, I've been on my own shit and I never cared
So done with the good for nothing
The, ""Why so sеlf-assured? You're bluffing""
It's all personal
If I fuck with your shit, you bеtter take it personal
I'm murderin' any beat you send me 'cause I'm versatile
But if I ain't like your shit, then you won't get a verse at all
I came to vibe, but he just wanted to dap me up
And I don't fuck around
Boy, I'm leavin' that beat deceased, put it underground
Puttin' in elbow grease, takin' back the crown
I'm just makin' a masterpiece from my daddy' house (Chorus)

And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won

[Verse 2]
Hit me double bound, I still be the one
This shit goin' South, I still see the sun
In it, here and now, I ain't gonna run
To a savior or a harbor, or a haven
Dope shit's never on purpose
Tryna keep it controlled, it's so worthless
Still in my prime but it's like I ain't been before
'Cause I'm never on time, gotta let that shit find me
Give me a moment
I'm dizzy off the sound 'cause I mix it potent
So then I'll break it down into its components
You do it for the crowd? That's a bad omen, oh (Ooh)

[Chorus]
How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one

[Verse 3]
Hands start to shake and I'm thinkin' rapidly
Bitch, I'm seein' the truth in my circle, just like it's alchemy
Don't get in the booth 'til the beats are defyin' gravity
Ears been fuckin' blessed with a curse to be the best on the Earth
It's non-duality the way I lose myself in the method
And the strategy is solid, I'ma beat it to death
I'm like a machine, I'm diggin' out dopamine
You're never gon' find it, keepin' it quiet
Stay up all night and make the hardest shit you've ever seen

[Outro]
I don't fold under pressure
Yeah, whether manic, love, or depression
Every body-mind shift, I'm growin' the vessel
Half you motherfuckers feedin' off my essence
Yeah, brew too cold, they need a refresher
Yeah, I'm gon' wield this art like a weapon
'Cause I'm seein' past all the bullshit
Pit me on the pulpit, pick it out, it's only my perception
Now I decide
So use this shit as a guide when makin' that fuckin' type beat
And good luck findin' anyone like me
I got the whole scene weighin' on my psyche
'Cause I'm desperate for progression
Bring it closer to perfection, every session
When we linkin'? Uh
Pain poised when I make noise, cap get diminished
I'm too advanced for the game, boy, I'ma need a minute

A hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack (I'm using my imagination)

[Chorus]
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me bugging hеr last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smartеr to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask—

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm laced with poison, I can't escape the rush
This ain't love, boy, you're just a pick-me-up
And the gaze Medusa, locks rattlesnakes, debuffed
No need to purchase my soul, girl, I'll just give it up
I'm like ""God damn,"" she slid in, now we're breaking the ice
The concoction just hit me, it's dilating my eyes
Fuck my options, she pulled me in, she didn't even try
I was hypnotized soon as her lips met mine, I can't forget

My corpse is spillin' blood in the backseat
She's undercover, got a Trojan to crash me
Leave a scar on my soul, seein' stars in the road
I take it better when she don't even ask me

[Verse 2]
She got this on repeat
I'm obsessive as her, she obsessive as me (Yeah)
Laments turn me to stone, and her curves got me weak
She wan' get us alone, I can tell she a freak
It be like, oh no, she invited me to a pity party
But go home and hope you ain't leavin' with nobody
But fate sewn, she'll take me back to her place
Can't say this shit to her face or make up my mind, I can't forget
[Refrain]
A hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack
The things I do to see you smile
[Verse 3]
Yeah, I know I made my art entertainment
Carbon to coal, now my card can't decline and it costs my control
I'll let God integrate, but until then I gotta give in to you, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me

Don't even ask (Fall deep)
Then we vaporized 'til our fates aligned
I think we frayed the twine
Tethering space and time, I can't forget

[Interlude]
Into this trance
Your mind is programmed to drift on these words
Use my voice in your head as a thread to your heart
All that pain you're carrying, all that regret (She knows)
I can remove it, all you have to do is let me (She grows, she grows)

[Outro]
She grows through my throat and my chest
My tears were glowing just to muffle the screaming out
(Only remember you love me) Hi-Fi
Stuck in amber and honey
My headache split wide awake
I'll hide the pain for you
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, no (No)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, no, no, no, no (You left me nauseous)20Embed"

Learned, tryna find myself
It ain't gotta be a one-way fight
But every single time I ask for help
They just talk right over me, assume I'm fine
Now I'm closing every open door
Bent teeth and it's all my fault
I lose grip, wasting all this soul
I'm falling apart

'Cause no one cares for me, except me
I'm chilling by death, CBD
Baby, was something I said too extreme?
Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care

Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care

I just really wish I warned myself (Run)
That because my momma raised me right
I would have to kick you off the shelf

[Verse 1]
I was tryna make a living
Well I did, and now I don't wanna live at all
And you wonder why I'm distant
My only friend is whatever I was trippin' off
Yeah, but you would never get it
You turned my personality into some kind of fetish
You think it's all copacetic
I hit your pen and then I lost it
Ever since then, I've been manic and exhausted
Think I wanna die and I can't keep my mind off it
Twenty-four-seven headache and I'm always nauseous
Cut my losses, 'cause I can never tеll if it's somethin' I really wanted

D-D-Dropped out, I was seventeen
Wasting all my money, mixing dope and LSD
Man, mama said, ""Don't get ahead of me""
But I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams
Well, I don't know what's gotten into me

Dropped out, I was seventeen
Now I've got more freedom than I've ever seen

Life don't have directions
And I been tryin' to quarantine
The thought of Heaven in the meantime
I've realized I've been there before
All the doors are closed, wanted so much more
Now it's nice to know there's no enemy
Or a victory

Exhale in the ninth cloud, cloud nine

Cancel your plans, authority couldn't handle us

Low blood sugar and some more caffeine
I don't need loving, but I want that cheap
So much luck that I've laughed to pieces
[Verse 3]
Looked inside for some consolation
I found a bi-dime in his prime, embraced it, I
Learned it was never complicated
You are who you are, don't keep you waiting
I said you are who you are, don't keep you waiting
(I can't wait no longer) I said you
(Won't you say something)
I said you are who you are, man (I can't wait no longer)

[Chorus]
Dropped out, I was seventeen
Wasting all my money, buying 1P-LSD
Mama said, ""Don't get ahead of me""
But I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams
I don't know what's gotten into me
Ever since I stopped pretending, it was history
Dropped out, I was seventeen
Now I've got more freedom than I've ever seen

Four years, really

[Verse 1]
Turn the lights on
I can stay awhile, but you wanna get me off
Think I don't say enough
I won't be runnin' back 'long as I'm faded and
Fucked up 'cause you're gone and the clique gone too
I turned to someone I could hold onto
I didn't understand how it would have backfired
Wonder who I am
Man, who the fuck am I?
I can't take a lie back, now it's stuck outside me
I can't take this shit lightly
If you want an ear, you know where to find me

[Pre-Chorus]
High on IG, flirtin' with a couple homies
I said I'm too eager, couldn't keep you
And she told me, ""Keep it lowkey, only rule is staying open""
I'm like, ""Where'd my line go?""
You just stole it

[Chorus]
Try and catch me tying up loose ends
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I'm past you, didn't wanna fuck you again
Yeah, I just wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I never wanna fuck you again
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends
You might also like[Verse 2]
And I no longer plan to hide in the snow and wait 'til you hold my hand
Now there's a four in five chance that she'll get her fine friend
And I'll be a nine-ten to 'em
Fucked up 'cause you were gone and the clique gone too
Turned into someone people come onto
I didn't understand how I could've macked
Y'all gonna wonder who I am

[Chorus]
Try and catch me tying up loose ends
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I'm past you, didn't wanna fuck you again
Yeah, I just wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I never wanna fuck you again
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends

This is sacrilegious how I'm gon' fade off IG (brakence)

[Verse 1]
Heartache comes in many forms
One day opens any door but
I've never seen this distant
What success? My eyes are on a screen
If you're hurting, call my line
And if you're doin' good, it's not like I don't care
I wanna see the world
This shit ain't the same if I can't breathe your air

This is sacrilegious how I'm gon' fade off IG (I can do everything)

Thought I really want your love but you don't know me
Text you all damn night, hour unholy
I couldn't get a second of sleep when I found out you were just my type
I was dead wrong but it felt so right
When you caught my gaze with those dark green eyes
And I'm never gon' change thinking 'bout that twice
It's all chord changes and vocal lines
I'm a mess and it looks like you got your shit together
But despite all of my first impressions
I can't imagine what's gonna happen
Get your ass back here

Deny it was best
The rest is left up to the somethings that exist outside my head
Now we've got a wedding for a whole week
Hold each other, remember the thing you told me
Now there's only minutes until this plane leaves
But, wait, did I just leave heaven or is it waitin' there?

[Chorus: brakence & 50Landing]
I'm never gon' let you down again
I'll fuck you good as I imagine

If all is lost
I've got the peace in my mind
You'll probably be fine

But since I've made some more mistakes—

And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me

Think I'm dreaming
This isn't real
'Cause you leave in a month
And I'm fiending for something to feel
When you hold me
Know you know me down to my core
This is the calm before the storm
You diverted attention away when I mentioned
That someone else gon' need you more

Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me

And I fell apart in that bed
What we built isn't me
Won't put it back together again

I can't take back what I said
I just look through those messages I left on read
Ooh, and I took you to Rosier
'Cause I thought we could cope
We got out on the ocean, I fell out my boat
And you calmed me back down
And you gave me some hope
And I tossed that away for a seratone

I just took- I just took a fourth of a tab of acid. I'm microdosing right now. And I'm by myself in this house and I'm whispering actually because there is someone home and they're across from me

[Verse]
Yeah
I know you wanna— (Yeah)
I know you wanna be me
I did it so y'all really don't have to
Eat, fuck, and make beats then I fall backwards
Could live my whole life on a twin mattress
Just had to realize that it's all practice
Dropped out in two weeks, I got no manners
She says she wanna fuck with a synth nerd from the suburbs
Ain't a lover or kisser
She don't care if you don't follow her on Twitter
She said her kink is people being honest with her
I've learned to do that
No, I don't overthink shit
I assume absolute fact
Kenny rode on my way in the cold to get
Tools for when old thoughts make me loop back
The crew mackin', I knew Jack before we met
School was trash, I got new cash and I'm not impressed
I'm psyched out, I fly South by South West
And meet friends from featuring on SVNSET
Fuckboy thinks comments are gonna stop me
Dismiss that, this shit's not a hobby
More than enough sauce in my skinny body
Big chillin' like Harlow, my eyes Sonic
So now I'ma really drop
These visions for 2020 when I'm landin' in 50's spot
If I had no streams, it would still feel a milli' hot
'Cause I got a best friend, now we need to meet at the box, no-oh
Now I'm really popping
Eight feet down, get it out then I'm city hoppin'
And even though not one teacher would catch me stoppin'
I gotta slow down, look around, and enjoy the small shit
So I'll be pickin' up when my mama calling
If you're wonderin', I prolly don't care about itYou might also like5Embed"

Now I haven't seen the sun in months

As soon as I get out, we'll get it in
So I better fuck off with the small talk
You can save the mileage
I poured sauce then it popped off
And I made it out here
I'm all up in your mentions and I know you 'bout this
I'm all over your main thing and he know about us

And the letting go, woah
Now I got leads inside my stomach
And I don't need 'em for nothing
But I'ma let 'em grow, woah

You know I've been caught up in my lie
It's never for the worst

It was something for the floor

So call me to accord
You know I've been caught up in my lie
Heaven was the curse (Is it a telephone?)

And I can't be myself unkindly
So I won't be treadin' lightly
My legs are gon' be sore

And people act like uprooting gon' distract a kid

And anywhere I go, there's always an out of here

I  ain't get above in the fifties
And  I know this isn't makin' up for lost time
No difference made, but now I know mine
Makin'  the same mistake for my whole life
Now I'm gotta keep it all tongue-tied
Forty-five minutes 'til you're really gettin' tired
And you'll keep your distance, oh my God
I  don't need the time, I just want your love
And no thought and prayers and heartfelt lies gon' play
I guess I don't know the faith I got
It wasn't myself, it wasn't my boss
And now all this searching brought me back to say that

I don't care 'bout a stare or judgment
I don't care, I don't care

I don't know me outside this head
You reminded me of what I thought free meant
And so we made a friendship out of finding out who we are
And I’ve stopped trying since you told me
I'm only what I want
That ain't me

So could you call me over without the bitter hesitation
And place your money where your mouth is?
All my thoughts are clouded
But I can still say I’m 'bout it soon as my head gon' cave in
Oh and if I had the chance to remake all of my decisions
Well, I wouldn't take it
Because you got me fucked up but if I don't use this as agency

(brakence)
We keep doubling our words and this doubling is comparable to Oscillation
When you get to think that you think your thoughts
The you standing aside the thoughts has the same sort of consequence of seeing double
I am worried and I ought not to worry, but because I can’t stop worrying, I am worried because I worry and that is what we call anxiety, trembling

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know for a fact that it's my fault
I know for a fact that I'll resolve
Somebody take me away from (Haha)
'Cause I know for a fact that it's my fault
And I'm trying to live with a result
Yeah, I know for a fact that it's my fault
Yeah

[Outro]
I will do my best to overcome when winter's no more
And I know, well, I'd never be this far without my mother
At least my older will, will take me places I need to go

This is what I've discovered

[Verse 1]
I used to know my ethic
Now I'm bouncing off the walls of my intent
And I want everyone to know me
But I'm looking past required interaction

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been looking down your path like a mental quickscope
Look in your direction realize that you wan' be friends though
Talking 'bout release dates, dominate my end goals
Yeah, I know I can do it, just gotta put in elbow (br-brakence)

[Verse 2]
Bad talk, good luck (Ay)
I'm lacking my funds (Ay)
Got no face on my passport
Got no haze in my lungs (Ay)
I just sit there and flashback
Fall backwards, I backtrack
Don't call me stupid, I'm dumb
Don't call me Cupid, 'cause, uh
Brakence made a brand new sound now
And if you hear it you won't wanna fuck with me
Worst handshake in the world
But when I show up they still wanna be stuck to me
'Cause I don't really care about the flux
Just your drive and your passion to do something that you love
Act up, yeah, I got it from the Wi-Fi
Everywhere I go want to see her in the night-time
Keep me up late, got me doing all the right crime
And running my ego right off a mattress
Think you're funny but really you stuck in past tense
I can get a little religious, no, I ain't static
Now I got a skill but how am I gonna cash this
You can keep it coming 'cause I'm gonna run it back

I'm tired of these motherfuckers in my headphones
Loaded up with questions 'bout my mental state, Velcro
Booked weeks, like I really wanna keep up this show
Fuck everything but my DAW and my SO
And now I find myself enthralled
There's a reason I forgot what I was thinking, yeah
And I was trained to be responsible
But I can't do it with this screen in my lap

[Outro]
So I'll just be like
Get outta my Insta feed, why you wanna be a friend of me?
I'm a nerd, I don't care about one-night stands or drinking on the Hennessy
'Cause I'm on Earth to fight entropy, but I'm using chaos as my energy

(Okay)

[Verse 1]
I hold onto patience for them
And reflect their mannerisms when I can't focus
Tired of selfish things I've said but never really spoken
I can't take back what I did when I forgot
So, I lack poise and, yeah, I noticed
But I drove it into the ground like it was poison
And I said I got a problem, will you show me?
But just because I need your help, don't mean it’s important
And now

[Bridge: brakence & Ballerina]
(None of us knows, Major. We don't know who we are)
You know
(We don't know where we are)

Just know, I'm trying
But I faked you out on my end
And behind those shaded words
I partake in limbo, not violence
'Cause I'm just trying to feel like
More than my entry
I can't tell by deceit I'm alright and
It's 'bout time I show I've been lying
'Cause I can't wait back for it here
The only fear I'm in love with is pointless
I don't need luck, I need somebody's help for a minute
'Cause I've tried long enough
Pray I lost, I am done

[Bridge]
Change my mind 'cause I'll be broken if there's nothing left to say

[Verse 3]
Just know I'm trying
But within a second it's timed in
(I've just never heard of them before)
Minding every word, and it's taking over afraid to love
But I will keep you around
You say I'm onto something, I doubt it
I find God in mind
Now I'm waking up and taking on my pride

You know I think about it way too much
I just wanna feel my fate, like, I don't know how to touch you safely
(Your DJ has only just begun)

[Verse 1]
So what if you're not confident?
You feel that way to me, so don't look for more offerings
To bother you with how you're following a fuckin' part of you
If opposite, at least you got a starting point but it's hard to do
This is far from taking mainstage
I'll park the car away from over where the cane sprays
I need an argument for my obnoxious ways I shake state
To override my comfort zone, depart it and I'm on pace
But I don't need to race
Always say if you need some space
Be more safe if you open gates
I'll be waiting to do you favors
I swear this in my nature
My patience is open acres, I care if you're faking playfulness
And my lies all slowly faded so I cried and then I faced it
I don't even know my patience
I'm not clean
But I am not waste
I took his ego to the movies, that's a docked case

And I say, ""Oh my God, oh my God, I am""
While I take you out of this place I hope I'm not phased

Anytime I touch her it was just soft
You know it wasn't the harsh or an act
It was just like floating and it was just different
I-I sat for an hour with the groom we both just explored each other’s faces with our fingers, you know
It was— It was just beautiful I mean it was just incredible because
Well, that's— That's your attitude toward everything, I mean
You just wanna re-examine things that you’ve just taken for granted

I'm tired of feeling the same
So find me breaking up the world with a smile on my face
And I am letting go of anxious things I don't need to say
I don't need anyone's attention, I just need to replay
And I'm finding what I can make
So if you're looking for a staple, you can get out my way
And I just want the people 'round me to be stuck in their place
Don’t need to stay so apprehensive if I just stay awake
It’s you need me or you don't, girl
Say, ""I don’t need you, I need your world""
Everyone is moving forward
With their conscience and their God's plan
So give me more of what you wanted
Give me what you never saw
When you wouldn't look me in what I meant
But it's alright if you need some more time
To reflect on who we are in my head
I’ll be frozen under sleep when I return

But it’s probably a social kind of thing

Is this another distraction?

Is it my fault that I’m calling it beforehand?

I'd like to find the word because I can ordinarily find them, but it seems to me that... uh...
I can't seem to want to say what I was going to say

[Verse]
Kind to the floor when I walk
I'm just taking all my time
I'm so original
I just don't wanna fuck up
It's not intended to get her attention in my head
The last time that I ever looked up was the time I told her she was beautiful
I'm fucked up, buzzing
And I might as well buy myself an ego check from the neurotic fever I just failed to let go
I don't care so much about my social responses
When I feel this good the future doesn't fucking matter
And I'm laying, rest, when I stay up myself till one then I fade
Then I fade
I give myself a headache, I'm gonna show up late
I'm trying to give it time, but I'm falling for the preface
It's not blank
I'm trying to tell her how I think

[Chorus]
I need faith
In what pride I have
And to exchange my witnesses
'Cause I don't know them now
But I will
After I fall apart
And I can't see it
'Cause I'm not equipped

It's almost like the... the singing of-of angels or something
I think it's the... soundtrack or the film going through the...
The machineEmbed"
