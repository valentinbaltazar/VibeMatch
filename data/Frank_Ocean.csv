Yeah
Piece of paper in my mouth, let my demons out to play

No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket

Playin' way more laid back than I did when I was my younger self
You would vent to me 'bout assumptions
But they were educated guesses
That's why I keep spinning your block, tryna see all your sides
And your heart's been tangled in barbed wires
You can hand it to me, I can handle it (Yeah)
If I had all but you then I would face it, then it'll come back 'round
All your affections, respect for me (Oh)
Oh, yeah, we got boundaries
They're just obstacles you're puttin' in between us, oh no
We can choose and we both got options
Less affеctions, narcotic, oh
You were sexy, contradiction
You want еxtra than me, but it's not threatening to me
I'm dialed in with ya
And I figured if you're going out with them
Then y'all gettin' filthy then it won't be angelic

We was on a date

You don't wanna fight, you ain't built for that, huh
Yeah, roll call, you can see my hands
Jaws gon' break
Lip gon' bust, you like
“Why you snuck up on me
And ain't say nothing?”
I bit until my tongue gushed
I couldn't say 'I I—'
Huh? I ain't say nothing
I ain't say nothing
Get so paranoid
I ain't see nothing…
[Verse 2]
I used to play tough with the cops, had ideas
Told my girl who protest hold me a spot, and I'll go
Black folk know what talking white means, but still
Hold two open hands up in the sky, finger quotes
In my gangly youth my limbs used to swing like Polo tees
Mazal tov, still pop a bottle like what Puff did Steve
If you can't tote your own weight then what's this buff shit even ‘bout?
Crystals in your lil' feet, that's all that dust protein
Swoop Tremaine from Calabasas in a Brit sports car
We used to cypher in Marc Jacobs, had the library card
At Scott's comparing the silver spoons to plastic knives and sporks
I was the dog breathless chasing the car up the street
If I ever catch it I'll panic, that's the flaw in me
Nothing glamorous about growing up poor and naïve
Standing on the balls of my feet, trying to pray before I sleep

[Chorus]
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright
Bright, bright, bright, bright

[Verse 3]
I try to sleep, can't get a lot
Make dreams bleed into days
The pressure couldn't stop
The bleeding I started seeing things
Watching out for demons
Blocked him like a screen, these plays
I was always reading, yeah
Then some hair grew where the sun don't shine
And I started feeling like pussy popping was the paradigm
Getting my dick wet, maritime
Lying on my virgin, Jergens moisturized
Gee whiz, gee whiz, gee whiz
All my friends is so, “No homo”
Blaze to trail behind
No heroes in front of mind
Just rappers who'd evolve with time
Looked up to them, knew all the rhymes
But at that time they enforced a bias
You know like some cops stop and frisk a guy
‘Cause he's brown, so of course he sides
With all the gangs these lames is extorted by
Switch lanes in the Porsche I drive
Let the police Ford Explorer by
Sirens screaming like they four or five
Throwing tantrums on the 405
Still on the whey like I'm tryna gain
Don't hibernate in the winter, that's where summer bodies are made
Just leg days like a sprinter
With the Bryan Baby blue interior
Big B's like GMO's
And they sting when my eyes close
All I see when my eyes close
Blame my emo on time zones
It's the same but different
Sets, twin siblings, head spinning
Exorcist

[Chorus]
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright
Bright bright bright bright

Praying Mantis
Fit by the Asians, wrist by Lorraine

[Verse 4]
Speaking of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
The bishop was tweaking, and we was Baptist
So how you a bishop? Like technically speaking
You drove a white Rolls, me and my family was type broke
The difference between having a home and not having a home was a tightrope
Visiting Catholic Churches, the masses was quiet as mice so
The minister spoke with no microphone
They had no choir, so silent I thought I heard Christ go
'You need a messiah'
Ran out the house from hormones, you seven months pregnant with Ryan
I figured I'd go to the East by my T for some peace and quiet
I ended up running the streets with my cousins, sitting in the back
Listening to beats, scheming on schemes that came to pass
They strategy murder yourselves, don't fall according to stats
I pray the new plots clear and thick as bulletproof glass
Cause the worst part of death is ambitions are dashed
Keep speaking death, it'll start to seem like the new car you wanna buy
It starts popping up on your way to work, see it all the time, always passing by
Call it playing Beetle-bug, yeah, it's on sight, better throw a punch
Running late to Teterboro, made the plane wait because it's no rush
Clouds floating over oceans from above
Kinda looks like bubbles on a tub
Kinda like…9Embed"

No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

[Chorus]
But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Verse 2]
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

Yup, duplex in New Orleans East
I was writin' down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleepin' on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stingin' me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower
My aunt-in-law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wifebeater
Bare feet and bra-less, titties swingin'
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok Classic's
Weaves and baskets
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Max's
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost your virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feelin' unnatural

[Refrain: Frank Ocean]
This what I would do just to show you that it's special now
What could I do to know you better than I do now?

My head fatiguing off the opus
Kept it underground to focus
I feel afterlife, six under oath, don't want no hocus-pocus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact, rip my facemask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net, is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Perusing the MoMA, I'm on all my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman? Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seemed like time's up
When we swerved in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time
I mean, time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved your crew
Like niggas came through with the Groupons
Cookin' with the grease now, truffle fries and Cholula
Are you slowin' down?
Are you holdin' down whoever held you down?
Whoever propped you up, built the structures with you
Swished the buckets with ya, who was fuckin' with ya?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you see 'em now is it forced black?

We were spending so much time, it was getting cooler

Over where the trees burn down

Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
All tonight, I'll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we danced this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (When I was young)
See me wither (When I was young)

Gotta rinse off here
I can't see your diamonds
I need a week paradise
I went god mode all year
I can't see so cloudy
Paradiso laundries
I keep the cheats on all year
Sometime in heaven
You still behind like ancestor
All on your mood board all year
I went god mode about it
You ain't got no muscles, lil' nigga
I ain't in the mood for it all year
I keep the cheats on always
Wrong side of average

[Chorus]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide off or peace out, yeah, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
For your mentality
You play ball, you run five-on-five least three times a week
Glen Park down the street
Waitin' on you to tire, retire with victory
Play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose, you don't cry, but you low-key sad to see
If we cut like some champions, you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-aah-uh, smiling
I'm still working while you dream, pop
I could never let a scene stop, smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point, pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi, tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day runnin' numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall
They're like, ""Something's gotta give""
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets, you can't see the sky, I'm out here
I could see the sky and it's paradise
On the regular

And when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on, oh, slide, yeah, yeah
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
First time on me, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
This is for that night when setbacks won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose (Blah-ahh, blur)

Keep the safety off innit
Now we finna have a mini
Outta wedlock, God forgive it

Might as well pay the mortgage, what I'm spending
Said the dick long as a swan neck
Put some real swans in the pond then

Let the LED roll Deerhunter
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience

Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, yeah, to be kind
Cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
It's a rush to the head
We've been here before (It's just like the water)
The first time is not the past time
I ain't felt this way in years
First, I was rushing for a wait
This time, I'm waiting for a rush

Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop (Do you wish you were me?)

Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off and on (Up on his feet)
Bygones, but we're still here, riding in my two wheels

Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self-contained and aware
Of each other's forms still and in full strides
Just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

[Refrain]
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you 'round the Higgs

[Verse 2]
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video; only difference is flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you showed
What you give, my words can't hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say

Yup, duplex in New Orleans East
I was writin' down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleepin' on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stingin' me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower
My aunt-in-law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wifebeater
Bare feet and bra-less, titties swingin'
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok Classic's
Weaves and baskets
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Max's
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost your virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feelin' unnatural

This what I would do just to show you that it's special now

U-N-I-T
U-N-I—

[Verse 1]
My head fatiguing off the opus
Kept it underground to focus
I feel afterlife, six under oath, don't want no hocus-pocus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact, rip my facemask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net, is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Perusing the MoMA, I'm on all my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman? Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seemed like time's up
When we swerved in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time
I mean, time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved your crew
Like niggas came through with the Groupons
Cookin' with the grease now, truffle fries and Cholula
Are you slowin' down?
Are you holdin' down whoever held you down?
Whoever propped you up, built the structures with you
Swished the buckets with ya, who was fuckin' with ya?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you see 'em now is it forced black?
Hail Mary on the fourth down
Hands to the sky, yeah

Peace to the holy, peace to the people that think they know me
Piece of Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing
Peace to the boys that we used to be though
Geto Boy, North Face too cold on these hoes
Peace out to Willie D, Bushwick Billy and 'Face
Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace
Hands to the sky

[Outro]
U-N-I-T-Y, Neptunes and peace signs
Chiraq, Palestine like
Iberville, 1995
You'd think that was airstrikes on outside
I put refugees in my villa, play kids the Fu-Gee-La
All this space Atlanta
Place order McMansion and two apple pies
I want the Porsche, a Bugatti-design
Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine?
Sick, blue nose pit foamin' white like frappo jacko
El Chapo, de facto
Bell nacho, shell taco, crunch-crackle
Green emerald, pink diamonds like Apple Jack bowl44Embed"

We were spending so much time, it was getting cooler

Over where the trees burn down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
All tonight, I'll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we danced this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (When I was young)
See me wither (When I was young)

[Outro: Frank Ocean & Jazmine Sullivan]

Sometime in heaven
You still behind like ancestor
All on your mood board all year

I ain't in the mood for it all year

Next time won't be, ooh, yeah, yeah

You play ball, you run five-on-five least three times a week
Glen Park down the street
Waitin' on you to tire, retire with victory
Play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose, you don't cry, but you low-key sad to see
If we cut like some champions, you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-aah-uh, smiling
I'm still working while you dream, pop
I could never let a scene stop, smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point, pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi, tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day runnin' numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall
They're like, ""Something's gotta give""

Gonna be somebody, oh I follow
Running showers, in a mist so cloudy
Enough time to know, know nothing at all
I see the lines (Walls)
There's two lines (Walls)
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, yeah, to be kind
Cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
It's a rush to the head
We've been here before (It's just like the water)
The first time is not the past time
I ain't felt this way in years
First, I was rushing for a wait
This time, I'm waiting for a rush
(Oh, help me up off my feet)
Infatuation's your rush
(Help me, help me, help me off my feet, yeah)
(Do you wish you were me?)
Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop (Do you wish you were me?)
All what happens to be, now it happens to me, upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off and on (Up on his feet)
Bygones, but we're still here, riding in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel (I'll be up in a week)
Bet you wish you was me?
Might need some help on my feet
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be up to my feet
I'll wake up in a week
Wake me up in a week

Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self-contained and aware
Of each other's forms still and in full strides
Just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

[Refrain]
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you 'round the Higgs

[Verse 2]
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video; only difference is flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you showed
What you give, my words can't hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need

[Verse]
What it means to be alive on this side
(Said you wanna kill me now)
On this side
(Don't let me down)
On this side
(Down, down)
Fuck the other side
I'm on this side
I'm on this side
I'm on this side
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside

Those are my niggas for life
Mothers of us, be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us, be kind

When the wind blows
That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice cause his wind gone
Nigga sound like Reggie
If life is a woman them walls gone
They ran through her already

[Verse]
I'm thinking
My life is a virgin like wife in all white and
Tonight I'm determined
To give her insight, eat her right till she creams
'Till she writhes with delight
Ándale ándale, make her pray to the pipe
Make her worship that false phallic idle
I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow
I'm mindful of size
She's chockful of my swipe like a capsule
Sealed tight with that substance you need
Start a family tonight
In this Camry we might
Mean this big body Merc with the leather
Oak and the LED lights
That I don't even drive
I'm in London tonight
And it's all overpriced
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in
From the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich
Or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watchin' my fence
Like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope
Got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

[Bridge]
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

There were things you didn't need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive

Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing
By myself, gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you
Gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now, I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo

I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died

With a strawberry icee

I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need
Hope you don't think I'm easy
What starts inside these hallways
Always comes and goes
I come from nothing
Like you come from nothing
Light like a laser cut from the navel
Til it's dark as a plum
Back where we're from
Don't take life so serious
If you find another
He could sleep right here
Between the two of us
I'll move over some
I hope he doesn't think I'm easy

Keep alive, stay alive

That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the 5
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fuckin', underneath moonlight now
Pretty fuckin', sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur, hey)
Summer's not as long as it used to be

Wanna film a tape on a speed boat?
We smell of Californication (Strike a pose)
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows (Ooh)
Can you come when I call again?

On comes the evening, gold seeking ends

Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that

Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you

When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress

But we've got Alcantara everywhere

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road
Your dilated eyes
Watch the clouds float
White Ferrari
Had a good time
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're so familiar

I care for you still
And I will
Forever

Running my hands thru your hair
White Ferrari
Had a good time
(in this life)

One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids
On a facelift
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it it'll be over in no time
And that's life

I'll drop you off and in a few months
We'll talk again
When you need a break
Which part of the circle will you stand on
You keep doing the dance wrong

I'm sure we're taller in other dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of moving
Your body's aching
We should vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull
Least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam
Like a mirage
Always one step ahead
Where we belong
I've got a son somewhere
He'll be picking up where I left off
I might name that boy Ferrari
He'll meet a girl named Altashonda
He'll treat her soft like Alcantara
My brain is soft like Alcantara
My hands are rough, I'm iguana
Your hair is long, are you Nicaraguan?

The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
(Brave)
I'm not brave

[Verse 2]
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes, I've
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views (Nice views)
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell
(It's a loop) What would you recommend I do?
(The other side of the loop is a loop)
This, this fe—, this feel, this feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel

[Verse 3]
Speaking of nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot

[Verse 4]
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon

I will always love you
How I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
Still, I'll always be there for you
How I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You'll look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always

Alright, hold on

[Verse 1]
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day and not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for seven dollars a hour
Call my mama like, ""Mama
I ain't making minimum wage, mama
I'm on, mama, I'm on
Now  I'm making 400, 600, 800K, mama
To stand on my feet, mama
Play these songs, it's therapy, mama
They paying me, mama
I should be paying them""
I should be paying y'all, honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was, I don't know which heaven would have me, mama
Let me run this bitch, I'ma run it into the ground, mama, the whole galaxy
Goddamn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas

Fuck me if I hated on you

Nigga, you got some just like me, don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree throw a big shadow (Jamming to the rhythm)
Tech company, please give me immortality (It's a face to face)
I'm going rapidly, fading drastically (Keep me high, Castrati)
Damn (Punani fade the stress)
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now (Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke somethin'

They tryna find 2Pac
Don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press
He escape the stress

I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga, murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cuff bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my photo
I only got one four-door
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song, so I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar

'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas wan' fight in the streets
Now shit startin' to make my hands hurt

These bitches want Nikes

Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes, but the real ones
Just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick, I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papá
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' 'bout somethin'
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

A seatbelt reached across her torso, riding up her neck and a mop of blonde hair stayed swept, for the moment, behind her ears. Her eyes seemed clear and calm but not blank, the road behind her seemed the same. I put myself in her seat then I played it all out in my head. The claustrophobia hits as the seatbelt tightens, preventing me from even leaning forward in my seat. the pressing on internal organs. I lean back and forward to release it. Then backwards and forward again. There it is—I got free. How much of my life has happened inside of a car? I wonder if the odds are that I'll die in one. Knock on wood-grain. Shouldn't speak like that. We live in cars in some cities, commuting across space either for our livelihood, or devouring fossil fuels for joy. It's close to as much time as we spend in our beds, more for some. The first time I did shrooms, my manager had to come rescue me from Caltech's 'Trip Day.' As I got into her car, I swear to God the aluminum center console in her Porsche truck looked like it was breathing, like the throat of something. On the freeway, leaving Pasadena, we spoke and I looked away, outside, at the wheels and tires of cars doing that optical illusion thing they do where it looks like they're spinning backwards, which, according to Google, happens because our brains are assuming something completely wrong and showing it to us. Staring, I was transfixed by all the indicator lights oscillating and throbbing against the wind. We drove thru downtown LA headed west, flying on the same freeways I used to run outta gas on. Welcomed in by the perennial creatures, imperial palm trees and climbing vines living their lives out just off the shoulder. The feeling familiar enhanced, on the 10. I used to ride around in my sinewy crossover SUV, smoke and listen to rough mixes of my old shit before it came out, or whatever someone wanted to play when they hooked up their iPhone to the aux cord. A few years and few daily-drivers later I'm not driving much anymore. It's been a year since I moved to London, at the time of writing this, and there's no practical reason to drive in this city. I ordered a GT3 RS and it'll keep low miles out here but I guess it's good to have in case of emergency :) Raf Simons once told me it was cliché, my whole car obsession. Maybe it links to a deep subconscious straight boy fantasy. Consciously though, I don't want straight—a little bent is good. I found it romantic, sometimes, editing this project. The whole time I felt as though I was in the presence of a $16m McLaren F1 armed with a disposable camera. My memories are in these pages, places closeby and long ass-numbing flights away. Cruising the suburbs of Tokyo in RWB Porsches. Throwing parties around England and mobbing freeways in four project M3s that I built with some friends. Going to Mississippi and playing in the mud with amphibious quads. Street-casting models at a random kung fu dojo out in Senegal. Commissioning life-size toy boxes for the fuck of it. Shooting a music video for fun with Tyrone Lebon, the genius giant. Taking a break/reconnaissance mission to Tulum, Mexico, enjoying some star visibility for a change. Recording in Tokyo, NYC, Miami, LA, London, Paris. Stopping in Berlin to witness Berghain for myself. Trading jewels and soaking in parables with the many-headed Brandon aka BasedGod in conversation. I wrote a story in the middle—It's called ""Godspeed."" It's basically a reimagined part of my boyhood. Boys do cry, but I don't think I shed a tear for a good chunk of my teenage years. It's surprisingly my favorite part of life so far. Surprising, to me, because the current phase is what I was asking the cosmos for when I was a kid. Maybe that part had its rough stretches too, but in my rearview mirror it's getting small enough to convince myself it was all good. And really though… It's still all good.

Auntie Fee: Let me tell you the last time I saw him. He always had a habit of running out of gas and he runs out of gas at 2:30 in the morning on the Santa Monica Freeway, OK? He calls about 10 people to come get him and nobody would come get him. He calls me at 2:30 in the morning. I say, 'Okay, not a problem.' I get up out of my bed, get my AAA, get him off the freeway, get him to the nearest gas station, put gas in his car and give him $20. I never seen him since. Except one time.

Developed over decades, our color code consists of a finite and precise color palate. The color code is non-negotionable. We do not stray from the color code. The whole world as we experience it visually comes to us through the mystic realm of color.

Green.
In the studio, green is olive drab. OD 7 is our olive drab.

For OD 7, our preferred choice is Kyron Industrial Camouflage 8143 Olive Drab. Hove this has been discontinued.

The search continues.

Yellow.
McDonald's Yellow - Golden #1130-6 Series 7
Kodak Yellow - Golden #1147-6, Series 6

Red.
Impervex Latex Enamel High Gloss - Brillaint Red 309

White.
Flat Finish Acabado Liso Sin Brilo Decorators White N215 04

Alternatively: native whites i.e. 1989 Chevrolet Police Package White or Hunt Foamcore White. Chevrolet Caprice, Balaenoptera musculus,  ""Tom Sachs"", Fondazione Prada  Milan, Italy, 6 April -15 June 2006

Black.
Flat: Black N215 90 Flat Acrylic
Gloss: Black 30980

Orange.
Orange is a native color in the studio.
You will not find orange paint here.
Except for emergency situations.
Purple.
The color puple is a forbidden color. The color purple is forbidden in the studio. The color purple is punishable by death. There is never an excuse for the color purple.

Blue.
For all NASA meatball applications we use:
Benjamin Moore Imperevex Latex High Gloss Metal and Wood Enamel  Classic Navy 309 35.

Pantone color standards are generally avoided because their limited range discourages subtlety. While we admire Pantone’s packaging and judicious use of Helvetica, we resent choosing from their limited offerings. Secret societies conspire to keep us in the dark ages of color. Comitee mentally guarantees that shitty cars like Saturn are only available in teal and maroon.
In this studio, we shun decision by committee. Instead, we look to the superlative Porshe palate, which rains beautiful despite the company's Nazi heritage and douche bag clientele.

And she comes correct; within moments, a stream of stories, pearls of wisdom, life lessons, and mottos flow freely, with a cadence and rhythm that’s almost song-like. Born in Louisiana, raised in LA, she’s the devoted mother of Frank’s good friend Jonathan. Rosie refers to Frank (aka “Lonny”) as her nephew, and is also called “Auntie” by the likes of Syd the Kid and Tyler the Creator.

“With Lonny,” Rosie recalls, “he had that drive towards being successful. And certainly, they spent enough time in Sydney’s studio to make a lot good music together, and they did. I was a lot more worried about Tyler. I remember chasing him around the house saying ‘Tyler, I think you’re crazy, I think there’s something seriously wrong with you.’ And I remember Lonny was there and said, ‘Auntie Rosie, let me get this clip!’ I said, ‘You better not!’” She laughs. “I had curlers all in my hair. And he wanted to get this on film!”

With a big heart and warm personality, Rosie’s quick to take others on as her own, and give Frank the same maternal care and advice that Jonathan reaps, as heard on “Not Just Money,” an interlude on channel ORANGE. She also has a particular flair for voicemails: She makes another guest appearance on the new album, with a voicemail that warns of flesh-eating bacteria that’s roaming rampant on college campuses.

Sat in an IHOP where the waitress knows how she takes her coffee (extra hot for the first cup), Rosie comes here often to study, currently in graduate school for Psychology and Therapy. Though she can chat for days, she’s an equally good listener, and an acute observer, the result of 27 years working as a probation/parole officer in Los Angeles. Dressed superfly, with a sharp sense of style (due to her daily routine she calls “prep before you primp”) Rosie brings us into her world and tells it how it is.

Interviewer: How did Frank and Jonathan meet?

Rosie: They met through Eddie and Raymond, they are also my nephews. And then Jonathan introduced Lonny to Sydney. That’s how they came together, musically and creatively. They would meet at Sydney’s house in high school, and they would compose music. And they just loved it; they just had a wonderful time. And I stayed on Lonny: “Lonny, get my son home by curfew!” I made him give me his cell phone number, and I would fuss at him. I kept him running for sure.

Interviewer: Your voicemails are stuff of legends. What do you love about leaving people messages?

Rosie: I think when you call someone, you should leave a voicemail for them. But with my son, I do leave voicemails for him, I’ll often leave inspirational voicemails. Sometimes I leave nasty voicemails too! And I’ll leave nasty voicemails for Lonny too, when the timing is right! I want them to always remember to just be themselves, they don’t have to be the type of man described in a rap song. They don’t have to be balling, they don’t have to be ballers, they don’t have to be shot callers. I leave voicemails for my son in particular because I want my son to remain optimistic. I want him to know that his mother has his back, no matter what. I want Lonny to also know that Auntie Rosie is here for him.

Interviewer: What’s the last advice you gave to Frank?

Rosie: When I last saw him, he came by the house, and he was in this beautiful… Porsche I think it was? Sedan? It was gorgeous. And I said, ‘Remember in life, you have to have both swagger and sway. With swagger alone, you’re convincing yourself that you have something that you really may not have, and that others don’t see in you. sway is knowing what to do with that swagger. Sway is influence. It’s persuasion, and I shortened it to sway. You have to believe in yourself, but you also have to impart that confidence in such a way that you convince other people to believe in you, and take a chance on you. In life, you’ve got to have both swagger and sway. Remember that.’ He laughed and said, ‘Okay Auntie, I’ll remember that.’ And I said, ‘By the way I am going to trademark that statement! It’s a Rosie original.’

Interviewer: Are you into cars as well?

Rosie: I really do love cars. I drive a 2006 Chevy HHR, and I love that little care. That’s the longest I’ve ever kept a car. Normally I would keep a car for only two years, because I love different cars. Although now I have a KIA Optima, which I’d bought for my son to drive when he was in college. KIA and Hyundai are sister companies, and I find they make very good vehicles. As a matter of fact, the car that Rodney King, black in 1992, outran the police in was a Hyundai. Imagine—this funny-looking black man, in this this funny sounding car, outruns the police. You know that made them angry! So even then in 92, the Hyundai was a very good car. It was very fast. I love cars. I have to wash and vacuum my car every week, because somehow I see the car as an extension of me. They seem to drive better when they’re clean! There was a commercial—I believe it was for Cadillac—and it said “when you turn your car on it should do the same for you.” I also owned a Cadillac, an Escalade, several years ago. And my motto was: “When you in a Cadillac, you know where you in a Cadillac, you know where you’re at.” They’re wonderful cars.

Interviewer: What was your favorite ever car?
Rosie: I would say my Chevy Camero. I was younger of course, it was red, it was fast. Of course, I appreciate the Pinto that my mother made my sister hand down to me, I think it was a ‘74 Pinto. But the Camero was the car that I bought for myself; it was my first brand-new car. And it lasted: I had over 100,000 miles on that car.

Interviewer: What are your thoughts on social media and the younger generation?

Rosie: I do believe that they are, in many ways, in a good place. I believe that social media is a medium by which they do communicate with one another, and also become activists in many ways. It truly is an opportunity for activism. However, I also do believe that it can also be very destructive in the sense that it can derail their focus. Forms of social media are potentially very addictive. And they can consume too much of your time to the point that you are too concerned with what other people think about you. I do believe that people that use it have to know how to use it, and hot to limit its use.
Sometimes I’d hear my son laughing in his room, so I’d walk in his room and say, “What’s so funny? What are you laughing about?” And he would say, “Mom, I’m talking to my friends.” And I’d say, “You’re not talking to your friends, you are typing to them.” I would go and get the house phone and bring it to him and say, “Here. Call them. Hear their voices.” I also told him this: “Do not ever ask a girl for a date through text.” If a guy ever asked me for a date on a text, I would probably text back something very unkind, with an exclamation point!

Interviewer: Do you use social media yourself?

Rosie: I don’t know how to Tweet. No, let me say this—I sent a tweet a couple of years ago, maybe a year and a half ago, to MC Hammer. Somehow I got a tweet from MC Hammer, and I tweeted back to him somehow in my reply! That was my one and only time. He had been arrested by the police—it was profiling. I said to MC Hammer, “Remember this. The lesson that’s to be learned is the police officer’s lesson to learn. It is his lesson to learn that not all black men are thugs, and that you can’t judge a book by its cover.” Actually there’s one thing I’d like to be able to use social media for! With Micheal Brown having been killed in Ferguson Missouri, there’s one tweet I would love to send out. I believe that this jury is not going to come back with an indictment of Darren Wilson. I believe that so much time is elapsing now over this entire case, I believe there’s a lot of corruption going on in the investigation of this case. One Tweet I would like to hear the crowd shout out is: “We know about the wait, they’re getting their lives straight!” I would love to have someone tweet it for me and say, “Auntie Rosie said that you all need to shout this out!” I believe that they are delaying the investigation of this case because they’re getting the stories straight. So—we know about the wait, they’re getting their lies straight. Although I’m a peace officer myself, I believe that we have to respect people, we have to be respectful to their rights, we cannot become so intoxicated with our own power that we in fact think that we own the world and we run it, and everyone else is just a guest. We have to stay in our place too; we have to stay in our lane.

Interviewer: What’s some advice you’d give someone reading this magazine>

Rosie: Don’t confuse stability with stagnation. In life, you want to move towards stability. The stability is what you want in your family life, it’s what you want in your job and career. Don’t look for excitement in everything you do; we have to be able to live and contend with boredom. But that doesn’t mean that you’re stagnated. Remain inspired throughout life, curious, moving forward. We should not be afraid to risk, to take a risk. We should have courage.

Interviewer: What’s the best advice someone gave you?

Rosie: I remember the encouraging words of my mother, who would always say—the sky is the limit. Her life was certainly not an easy life, being a black woman coming from the south. She raised five children on her own because my father also passed away, when I was a little girl. So my mother raised five children on her own, cooking and cleaning houses for other people. She did not have a formal education but she was one of the smartest people I knew. She was very bright, very intelligent, and she always imparted optimism in us to do our very best.

Interviewer: What’s important to you, in becoming a therapist/psychologist?

Rosie: As a therapist, and as a clinical psychologist, we are the agents of change. I believe that we should never give up on life. We certainly are all interconnected in life, and we all need each other, regardless of our race, creed, color, regardless of our nationality. My life—and how I interact with people—is not a zero-sum game, in the sense that my gains are not your losses, my losses are not your gains. I feel that my gains can help you win, and your gains can help me win. And so we all need help from one another.1Embed"

He holds a rectangular metallic card smaller than his palms with grooves on its surface. The street is quiet, the sidewalk clean. As he walks, he occasionally slows to peer inside the windows of parked cars. The cars have a familiar look though it’s obvious their designs are several generations ahead. The elegant lines, the materials and tech apparent in the construction are the result of years of engineering advances beyond the present.

The city feels simultaneously old and new, weathered by time and progress, lending it a distinctive quality. A modern city embracing technology but somewhat overtaken by nature, still trying to find a balance. There are pick-ups and wagons amongst the luxury cars, very democratic. Steely peers into a car with a cigarette in the ashtray. Using the metallic card, he swipes it against the car’s access strip and gains entry. He steals the cig, lights it and walks a few cars down. He notices a hanging air freshener in another car and decides he likes it, breaks into that car as well taking the fragrant contraband. The stillness is mesmerizing, you can barely hear the autobahn in the distance or the steps of his companion just a few feet ahead.

Caged court centered in a park somewhat densely populated with live oak trees, their limbs perfectly frame rather than reach above the court. Clark is around 5’10” or 11”, lean but strapping and towering compared to a seemingly younger Steely who just beamed a ball at Clark and nearly landed a punch before Robb and Matthew body-blocked.  Clark would have hurt him, badly, obviously, as Steely is a few years younger and developing a physique to match his mental toughness.

     Robb: ‘Whoa whoa whoa level down…’
     Matthew: ‘Kiss and make up, friends. It’s a contact sport.’
     Steely: ‘Nah, miss me with that, he always tryna big man somebody.’
     Clark: (Checks his face for blood. Spits.) ‘Game point.’

Steely steps up to guard him, placing his hand on Clark’s side to telegraph his movements. Clark crosses him, drives and lays the ball up, winning the game.

     Clark: ‘Whoo! (RIC FLAIR voice) Did you feel that? Did you sense the sublime finesse and technique just then? You should be grateful. You should be grateful for me. Here.’
     Steely: ‘Blah, blah, blah.’ (Shrugs and mimes, picks the dead basketball up off the ground and does a tricky slam dunk with excess energy.)

The quiet of the morning scene continues, Steely and Shoobie continue walking as if in a dream. No birds, no other people, no sounds of cars. You see cars though, and you can hear a faint wind occasionally disrupt the silence as it passes between the rubber of the vehicles and the concrete. The skyline is a blended ecosystem of the natural world and school buildings. Tall structures of glass, steel, brick and mortar raised on stilts of a hard clear substance. Limbs of trees reaching out through some windows, you see entire floors made into greenhouses and pocket jungles sprawling off rooftops. They approach a park where we see a sculpture of a child hanging from the sky from a string that goes up forever, touching the surface of a never ending rippling pond below with the tip of his finger. There are no paths of stone or concrete, the grounds are riddled with ever so slight inclines and valleys. There’s a large Olympic sized pool built with Carrara marble, students ice skate it during the winter and skateboard in it in warmer months.

Shoobie walks slowly ahead of Steely, carrying a slate of metal, head held high, inhaling deeply and gratefully from a harmless, flavored steam cigarette. She squints her large eyes eyes on a toke and looks back at Steely going inside of someone else’s car.  The colors of her eyes change. She keeps walking. Steely catches up and throws his arm around Shoobie — he quickly takes his arm back to himself then grabs both her elbows and turns her toward him.

     Shoobie: (Bobbing her head to music that isn't playing, she sings) 'That's the way everyday goes, every time we've no control...'

Steely looks up at the sky. A wide, flat translucent aircraft is coasting slowly above, leaving clouds in its wake and filtering sunlight into beautiful prismatic refractions onto him.

He's looking down at Shoobie, she's wearing radiation protective gear. Her helmet is mirrored orange and red, the suit has a white body. He focuses on her and not the campus being destroyed behind her by fire.
     Steely: ‘Is death a high? I heard it’s like DMT. The guy who told me that isn’t dead. Maybe it’s worth dying. The high I mean. Worst part about it though. We won’t remember being so tight you know? Look at us!’

(Brushes imaginary locks from his face)

     Shoobie: ‘...uhh?’

Steely looks down at his feet and there’s ice on the grass though it’s summer. Steely pulls his head up to say ‘snow’ but doesn’t even make the begining sounds of the word. A single ball of alloy, white encoded with ice, spins around them like a tether ball to its pole. Shoobie still mouthing the words to a song playing in her head. ‘If you could fly then you’d feel south, up north’s gettin’ cold soon…The way it is were on land — still i’m someone to hold true’.1Embed"

The kitchen consists of a small pool of self-replenishing fresh water, light cleansers instead of soaps, a BBQ pit, a stone oven, cabinets that are refrigerated and store food, dishes and cutlery. The floor is perforated with vents that heat and vacuum the floor for debris. Potted plants are in the windows as well as above the pool of water. Steely takes two bowls out of a cabinet, a knife, two spoons, a jar of milk, honeycomb, and bananas off a hook. He begins to prepare one bowl of oatmeal and one bowl of cereal. He slices a banana on a wood cutting board, places the banana slices on top of both bowls, swirls some honey on the oatmeal then walks back through the hallway.

The hardwood hallway extends into a room where Shoobie is seated in front of a white desk with a translucent top that is eventually lit from beneath. She’s sketching schematics with graphite while 3-D printing small pieces of the design from the sketch paper directly. Steely places the cereal on her table and sits on a full-sized bed cornered against the far left wall. Steely eats and looks around the room. Photos and schematics are placed on the wall, bed sheets spill onto the floor and Shoobie’s wearing PE shorts, varsity hoodie, ankle socks and a messy ponytail. It’s a perfectly lived-in moment that feels right in the ways you’d hope for when two people comfortably cohabitate. Just then he noticed a message in his field of vision.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Matthew:  ‘wya? wyd?’
     Steely:  ‘I’m here man. breakfast.’
     Matthew:  ‘ole oatmeal eatin’ ass boy’
     Danny:  ‘all star suck me ups last night’
Steely: ‘who?’
     Danny:  ‘imma bring her and her friend out to the water.’
     Steely:  ‘oh, OK.’
     Mathew: ‘about to shower---’
     Steely::‘Yea, I gotta do the same rn.’

Steely puts the phone down and finishes his bowl of oatmeal. Shoobie’s cereal sits untouched where he placed it, getting soggy.

Steely returns to the kitchen, puts the bowl in a light wash rack. He pulls on a shallow drawer and grabs a refrigerated metal slate from a stack of four. The slate responds to his touch, turning transparent while a swarm of light particles activate a 3-D projection an inch off its surface, making a mold of his hand. Steely places his hand into the particle mold then gets up and walks into the bathroom down the hall, to the right, then left of two bathrooms. Steely sits on the toilet and begins to masturbate to a video now playing on the slate. The ground changes hue.

There’s a signal that class is about to begin.

     Shoobie: ‘I’m going to class.’
     Steely: ‘Should go together.’
     Shoobie: ‘Yea – what about yours?’
     Steely: ‘I wasn’t going to go in there till later.’
     Shoobie: ‘Irrational fears again?
     Steely: ‘Naw…’
     Shoobie: ‘They won’t let you come into class late…’ (Steely cuts her off)
     Steely: ‘I know.’
     Shoobie: ‘Truant.’ (Stares him down)
They kiss. Steely leans into it a bit and reaches under her skirt. Students are watching them. She punches him playfully in the chest and he backs off. Steely leaves Shoobie standing there, while he disappears down a decline, through a grove of trees.

Steely arrives at the entrance to a gated community, as behind him a bullet train hydroplanes silently along a narrow band of water. He lights a flavored cigarette, drops it on the ground by accident and picks it up, he puffs it to keep it alive as he walks towards a guard post. As he approaches, a woman in her fifties hangs her head out of the doorway of the security quarters. Her name is Florence and it’s apparent she knows Steely.

Florence works multiple locations as a security guard and as Steely has developed his hobby of breaking into cars, he’s also developed a relationship with Florence. She suspects what he does but looks the other way, treating him as a favorite aunt would. She has a soft spot for him and occasionally Steely brings her cigarettes or coffee or a flower picked up along the way.

There are two mesh steel hates. In front of the gates are a row of solid metal cylindrical posts that swivel up and down into the ground.

     Florence: ‘C’mon child.’ (Lazily)

Steely speeds up to a slight jog up to her half door/half window.

     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘Put that out.’
     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘I’m proud of you. You know that, don’t you?’
     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘Give me a square, son.’

Steely goes in his parka pocket and hands two to the woman – she puts one to her mouth and lights it.

     Florence:  ‘Mmmhmm, go head on.’ (Turns an eye without turning her head.)

The gates clear, the posts lower.

Steely walks through the gates and down many stairs. Before exiting the stair well he stops to read a series of text messages from various senders.
BEGIN TEXT:

     Mia: ‘Another thought on perfection. The only problem with her is that she is too perfect. She is bad in a way that entices, and good in a way that comforts. She is mischief but then she is the warmth of home. The dreams of the wild and dangerous but the memories of childhood and gladness. She is perfection. And when given something perfect, it is the nature of man to dedicate his mind to finding something wrong with it and then when he is able to find something wrong with it, he rejoices in his find, and sees only the flaw, becoming blind to everything else! And this is why man is never given anything that is perfect, because when given the imperfect and the ugly, man will dedicate his mind to finding what is good with the imperfect and upon finding one good thing with the extremely flawed, he will only see the one good thing, and no longer see everything else that is ugly. And so...man complains to God for having less than what he wants...but this is the only thing that man can handle. Man cannot handle what is perfect. It is the nature. It is the nature of the mortal to rejoice over the one thing that he can proudly say that he found on his own, with no help from another, whether it be a shadow in a perfect diamond, or a faint beautiful reflection in an extremely dull mirror.

     Steely: ‘Sorry, I hope you feel better.’

NEXT TEXT:

     Steely: ‘You’re not athletic.’
     Clark: ‘We could line it up.’
     Steely: ‘You week, haha.’

NEXT TEXTS, STEELY READS BUT DOESN’T RESPOND:

     Unknown contact: ‘Have a day you dreamed of.’
     Andree (Pacific islander): ‘One more pak and I’ll drop it.’
     Kio: ‘BITCHES LOVE YOU.’

NEXT TEXT:

     Shoobie: ‘Who r u with rn?’
     Steely: ‘No one :/’
     Shoobie: ‘Matthew’s house? bored. misu.’

He finishes his correspondence and continues on. The stairwell opens to a strip where two wide roads sit, parallel but not separate. The left-hand road leads to a Cape Cod  style country club and what looks like a beach. Near the country club, a split in the main road leads to another wide, two-way road where the opposite directions are paved at different heights, like a shelf. There’s a black sand beach on one side and mature manicured hedges on the other; the tops of homes are visible. Steely walks down the road and as he passes a second block, the road narrows and inclines to a cavernous walkway that winds through the greater community.
A guys with a long curly afro, wearing a white hooded jacket with 3M accents, shorts, waist weights, and Nike running shoes comes out of a property. He jogs in place and does some light stretches. Steely walks up to the guy who turns out to be his friend Matthew, while casually running his fingers across the hedges. The two of them wave low and perfunctorily at each other then cross paths. Though there’s acknowledgement, it seems a bit clandestine as if they’re about to set something in motion.

Matthew jogs downhill with his arms outstretched and banks right into a still narrower canopied alley. Steely stays in place and keeps time. Matthew is now jogging perfectly center though a lane with mesh steel garage door every 50 years. He picks up the pace in his jog as you see the garage door open ten yards ahead – a white single-seater begins to speed out the garage but manages to stop right before hitting Matthew. Matthew acts startled.

     Matthew:  (Yelling at the Garten, and slamming his hands on the hood) ‘DAMN – NICE BREAKS!’

Matthew then jogs on following the car as it speeds in a straight line away from the scene till it’s no longer visible. Matthew hits a corner, makes a right and meets Steely back in front of Matthew’s house. They walk inside the yard gate through hedges and past fountains down a ramp into a cave like living space with an unobstructed view of the ocean.

They pass cleaning staff and art leaning up against the walls. Outside the window you can see where his yard slopes down to the ocean side cliff. There’s a pool with a high dive, a solarium, a lone, odd colored dog sits gazing at them as they walk through the house and towards Matthew’s bedroom. Matthew changes clothes quickly as Steely is talking to him about weed.

     Matthew:  ‘Fronto leaves?? – You act like you discovered fire.’
     Steely:  ‘You ever catch Mr. and Mrs. Hagen intimate – in their moment. I’d bet you haven’t, because they’re stuck with you. How free will they be when you’re out on your own? There’s a place for you in this world bro and I’m your friend, ok?’
     Matthew:  ‘You’re acting out now, you can stop.’
     Steely:  ‘Mrs. Hagen I’m sure is still very agile on that horse.’
     Matthew:  ‘You want some water or something?’
     Steely:  ‘Yea. Do you dance still. You used to be a good dancer. (Walks away to kitchen)
     Matthew:  ‘Pour my shake out the blender!’
     Steely:  (Calling out from kitchen) ‘Nah, you don’t have any ice!’
     Matthew:  (Calling out from bedroom) ‘Who the fuck said anything about ice?!’’
     Steely:  ‘Sorry, you know I really appreciate you buddy. I couldn’t find anything quite right for Shoobie’s birthday – everything’s so generic to her, she just scans it with her computer eyes.’

Steely walks into the bedroom again, Matthew is ready to leave. Steely hands him a shake and eats small pieces of fruit while finishing a blue can of Coke. The two of them exit Matthew’s room into an area where nothing else is in the shot apart from a right-hand drive Nissan Skyline from a hundred years ago and a small orange groove. Steely re-lights the fronto leaf blunt.

     Matthew:  ‘Put the fronto out. Drive.’

Later on the drive.

     Steely:  ‘I can’t think it’s too many notes.’
     Steely:  ‘He’s not on the 5 yet. That’s impossible.’
     Matthew:  ‘People are fucked.’
     Steely:  ‘He’s taking his time. How did he look when you ran into him?’
     Matthew:  ‘People are so fucked… Uhh, yea – he looked really happy to see me.’
     Steely:  ‘What are you talking..(cuts himself off)? Why are people fucked? That include you or nah?’
     Matthew: ‘People are just bad, like, toward other people. I should quit giving this traffic...but I can’t.’
     Steely:  ‘You gonna tell me something I don’t know?’ (Says this with the look on his face and not words.)
     Matthew:  ‘I showed you this already, but watch again.’ Handing Steely his phone to watch something.
     Matthew:  ‘When the lady gets sent to the neighbors house by her uncle to fight someone and she ends up running and getting chased, then falls down, breaks her shit and they set her on fire..’
     Steely:  ‘Yea, that hurt my feelings. She seemed to confident.’
     Steely:  ‘Did you listen to that Goye thing I told you about?’
     Matthew:  ‘Yeah. Are those lights new?’ (Looking at lights that follow the highway railing.)

Topography blurred outside the vehicle grass – suburbia and city overlapping – hyper color – non specific.

Matthew pulls into a sprawling office campus. We see a network of buildings, there are people from the company walking about engaged in conversation. One group in particular is huddled and highlighted.

     Colleague #1:  ‘Exploded?!’
     Colleague #2:  ‘Without heat?’
     Colleague #3:  ‘Yeah, or human shrapnel.’
     Colleague #2:  ‘So absent of heat, absence of residual bio and absent of our guy.’
     Colleague #1:  ‘He’s jumped on grenades before and lived.’
     Colleague #2:  ‘Chemiluminescence isn’t the mark of a grenade.’
     Colleague #3:  ‘Maybe saving the world a few times makes you eligible for dharmic ascension?’

Office campus is a ‘CAR FREE IS A CAREFREE’ zone – there is offsite parking for commuters.

Matthew’s car is stopped. They trade places at the wheel and Steely gets out. He walks towards the outskirts of the office campus. Matthew tries to pull unto the parking structure which is multi-level and underground. He begins to argue with the security person manning the entrance.

     Matthew:  ‘Why are you telling me I can’t park here?? It’s a free world.’
     Parking Security:  ‘Credentials please, sir? Sir. Sir. This is a corporate facility, credentials please.’
     Matthew:  ‘What’s the corporate ever done for me?! Huh? Since you know every God damn thing. What they done?? I should sit down right here and take a hot shit in the facilities.’

Steely walks down the ramp into the structure casually, trying not to be noticed – the distracted guard notices and chases after him shouting about credentials. Steely breaks into a sprint. Seconds later a small low flying autonomous aircraft is heard in pursuit of Steely down the structure.  Steely spot’s Garten’s car, the one that almost hit Matthew earlier, slides over the tip of it and almost falls of the edge of the parking structure which cascades into a waterfall, leading down into channels below street level.

Steely regains his balance and struggles with his car boosting key card, trying to gain access to Garten’s car. It isn’t letting him into the car and he begins to panic, but finally it clicks on – you can hear the whistle and the buzz of the security drone flying towards him. He slides down the seat so as not to be visible from the window. The drone flies to the edge of the parking structure and hovers, observing downward as the water flows. It then turns around and heads back to continue its search elsewhere. Just then Steely feels the vibration of an incoming message.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Unknown contact:  ‘Chase the rabbit three ways down, a ways to go.’
Steely:  ‘Who’s there?’
     Unknown contact:  ‘Do you have time?’

Steely’s baffled by the text but doesn’t have time to dwell on it, he starts the car and begins looking for another spot to park it, far enough from the original spot so as not to be noticed but still within the same parking structure. The perfect spot is three levels down. He carefully exits the car, makes his way into a common walkway towards a lift, gets inside though it’s crammed with people, and squeezes in amongst the plain-clothed engineers and corp. Employees all talking in code and oblivious to Steely.

Elevator doors open. Above ground it’s raining. Everyone braces for the rain as they exit. Steely puts his hood on and walks into an overpass. Billboards tower above it showing blue skies, a beach scene and a slogan that reads: “It’s June in Miami”. The rain continues pouring down, he’s still in the thick of the crowd. Steely exits down a ramp, jumps over a shallow ledge, walks under an overpass – there’s traffic speeding past him blurred – and begins to wait. Matthew pulls his car over, shining his lights on Steely. Steely gets into the car and steals the cigarette Matthew just lit from his mouth. Cars speed past going under and over intersections. A song played.Embed"

In one class, a smooth but occasionally glitchy 3-D projection of a teacher greets Steely. The teacher is severe in appearance and manner. Though her projection corresponds to a live human being somewhere else on the planet, she might as well be a robot or at least the ghost of a human once capable of warm emotion.

     Teacher: 'Punctuality appears to be your Achilles' heel, Mr. Grude. Alas, you've cleared H3, admirable. Quiet your ears, then solve the riddle.'

The teacher trails away.

Steely exhales loudly. Takes his bag off and hangs it on a hook. There is a digital 24-hour clock in the top left corner, it's black steel with white numbers. The walls are covered in floral wallpaper, overhead there's a clear paneled mechanical ceiling. The mahogany floors ramp up to class seating, with curves and layers dynamically represented. A wall for projection wrapped in a semi circle lies at the head of the class.

Steely breathes in deeply, dropping his shoulders. The room is so quiet. He closes his eyes. A montage flashing in his head: Shoobie's mouth, himself as a small boy calling up from a pit, fencing, climbing a fence, running. A small quiet click comes into his ears from a clock. The memory of his father first forgetting while giving a lecture at his school. The silence. The stutter. The angry burst at someone touching his arm. He remembers his father not remembering him. His mother throwing things out of focus. The canopied street. The first car he stole on a spinning platter. His father's car.

Steely is mumbling a mantra and slowly his memories whitewash away. He opens his eyes and he is seated on a chair in full lotus. He breaks position and pulls a tray out of a side compartment and now he has a surface with a bowl in its center, a few gauges and a small loupe. It's what seems to be a mini solar system that he's manipulating with the gauges.

The teacher swarms back in and places a decades-old transparency paper on a projector.

The riddle:

     Teacher: 'You poured it hot and you're stirring it up, now what's moving faster, the tea or the cup?'
     Steely: 'The tea.'
     Teacher: What's harder Mr. Grude, a liquid or a solid?'
     Steely: 'Shit'
     Teacher: 'Of course. And what does your understanding of physics inform you of as it relates to softness and hardness of matter, Mr. Grude?'
     Steely: 'That, from a sub-atomic perspective, my shit is composed of particles mostly vibrating at a higher rate than my piss.'
     Teacher: 'Thank you, Mr. Grude. Your deft articulation leaves little to the imagination.'
     Steely: 'You don't have an imagination.'
     Teacher: 'Well, congratulations Mr. Grude. It has been my pleasure watering yours.'
The teacher swarms off. A status bar appears on the projection wall as if loading something. When full, a dozen other desks appear next to Steely each with a student projection seated in them, creating trails with their movements. These projections seem almost real. Unlike the microcosm whose projections are light based, the students' apparitions are hard particle nano projections whose touch have a light weight, thus they can interact with the physical world on a low level. The teacher re-materializes.

     Teacher: 'Grad students, the last movie of your lives here. ""Giant""—1956. Enjoy.'

Steely looks down at his desk. His microcosm is developing well, thriving. There are 64 life harboring planets in his system. He looks through his scope. He monitors his gauges, adjusting tension and gravity here and there.

Steely receives a tummy rub via instant messaging from Shoobie, and a pouty face. He replies with a blush face. The movie plays and a couple of the students are watching. The class is 50/50 male to female. A swirl of different races and creeds. Someone's nose starts bleeding. A Japanese student crinkles plastic in a Russian girl's ear to annoy her. Two students are reading palms. Steely extends his hand, taps a blue eyed Korean kid named Kio.

     Steely: 'Howdy'
     Kio: 'Listen. It's out of control. My parents are hiring a load of lifeguards for this weekend. Apparently someone drowned last year at the pool party I've never had. Been on my Kegel exercises since last week.

(Kio's projection spreads hair on Steely's scalp with his swarm fingers and examines it before Steely shakes him away)

     Kio: 'Your hair is so clean?'
     Steely: 'Kio—get off.' (Doesn't move. Focuses his sight through the scope down into the microcosm.)
     Kio: (Speaking out loud) 'Western hygiene has lacked as fuck—these guys look dank.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Close your mouth!'
     Kio: 'Only if you keep yours open.'
     Blonde Girl: You're small.'
     Kio: 'She didn't talk to me like this last night. I'm so confused. This sucks.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Do you know I can hear you? What was last night? I'm in Morocco.'
     Kio: 'Last night, last month—whenever this loud sex was. I forget.' (Kio turns his head and is punched in the nose by Blonde's swarm hand.)
     Blonde Girl: (Warns) 'You are a small feeling. Do not!'

The downpour outside intensifies.
     Steely: 'She didn't like that one, Kio.'
     Kio: 'Bro, whatever, she's a lunatic, and she just got herself un-invited.'
     Steely: (Laughs and shakes his head.)

Dree, the Pacific islander student, taps Steely.

     Steely: 'That's TWO cartridges.'
     Dree: (Says 'okay' without saying anything.)

It thunders soon after a grand flash of lightning. Rain comes down heavier and heavier, then a black out.

The 3-D swarms of students and teacher disappear and the room goes dark. The glow of Steely's experiment is the only light source in the room. His gaze stays stuck on the system, its glow upon his face. Just then a message notice activates.

GROUP TEXT:

     Matthew: 'Anybody seen Robb? I think we lost Robb black ass.'
     Robb: A piece of me with always be inside of you.'
     Shoobie: 'lol' (emoticon)

Steely gets up from his desk, pulls his hoody over hid head and goes to use the urinals outside in the storm.

It's pouring as he walks toward a small shallow tower of urinals—they resemble a merry-go-round. He pisses with the rain falling on him hard. No one is outside. He washes his hands on a faucet above the urinal then heads back toward his class. Sunlight cuts through the rain. He gets back to his seat, soaked, and sits down in the naturally lit room. He looks down at his bowl for a moment, lights a cigarette and stares at it for a moment. Spinning it around and staring at the ember trails. The sunlight creates streaks across the classroom through the ceiling. He pushes everything back into a single point then folds the desktop back into the compartment.

Steely's eyes well up.Embed"

     Matthew (to Shoobie): 'So how'd you shut the power off? Generators didn't even come back.'
     Shoobie: 'No—I had a finals presentation.'
     Clark: 'Thought you handled your finals midterm'
     Shoobie: 'Extra credit.'
     Matthew: 'What are you?'

(Bonfire being set aflame on the beach)

     Robb: 'They're gonna shut that down any moment now'
     Grad Girl #1: (Eyes Robb while he takes off his clothes and puts on his wet suit.)
     Robb: 'Yea. I'm tryna get fit. So what. Swim.'

Robb pulls Junior girl #1 back into the water while the boat moves at a slower speed. Underwater shot shows Robb on a wake board being pulled by an aluminum speedboat. We see the turns and the flips and the fun.

     Matthew: 'I'm Shamu!' (Heard from underwater.)

Junior girls push Matthew and Danny. All fall in.

Sun going down—having brews—group talk.

     Robb: 'Always thought he had the better things.'
     Matthew: 'Kinda did.'
     Steely: 'Better looking staff, and the crazier grounds.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'I heard you have a woman in your shower who washes your back.'
     Steely: 'She's not a real woman.'
     Danny: (to Shoobie) 'When do you have to be over there? I heard that building is nuke-proof.'

     Steely: ‘Whole crew’s going different ways now.'
     Grad Girl #2: 'I'm taking over my parents' machine.'
     Grad Girl #3: 'You mean your parents' money.'
     Matthew: 'That's one thing that brings us all together, our parents' cash.. You too, my dear mid-caste offspring. Even you.'
     Shoobie: 'That's not what brings us together. But look, nepotism aside, I think you've done well for an underdeveloped intellect.'
     Matthew: (Grins in agreement) I would've quit this head job at first chance to climb locals and surf my life away. But the trust says I can't participate without taking my part in this ceremony.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'All I care about is world peace. All they taught me here was how to take notes.'
     Robb: 'OK, Miss Argentina.'
     Clark: 'I quite liked it here.'
     Steely: 'So that's why you didn't clear?'
     Clark: I cleeeaared.'
     Clark:Hey guys, listen. Alright, so. If I'm not fucking this person in person, but we get off to each other through the mesh all the time is it the same? Or am I trying to sell myself something? I asked em to take a job as my massage therapist to like simulate intimacy. Thought it was a long shot, but it worked out. It's been beautiful.'
     Shoobie: 'Who are we talking about?'
     Clark: 'That doesn't matter'
     Matthew: 'Is this person local?'
     Clark: 'Nah, isn't. It really doesn't matter guys.'
     Matthew: 'I think it's brilliant. Sounds perfect. Nothing left to be desired from my vantage point.'
     Danny: 'Hmm, I think it's nearly there. There's something missing that you might want—then again you might not want that at all.'
     Clark: Yea. It won't ever be like that.'
Steely drifts off imagining a frozen lake with another lake shining like stardust on its surface, the lakes reflecting a seamless white sky. White water.

Dream interrupted—RENNN RENNN RENNN!!! SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. An aluminum catamaran cuts through the water. Campus pull up on boats. Steely pours his beer out. Everyone hides their drinks. Water turns color.

     Campus Police: 'Please dock all watercraft and exit campus beach immediately.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'It's drop day! (Yelling at the police boat.)
     Campus Police: 'Please dock all watercraft and exit campus beach immediately.'

Campus Police speed away back to the shore. Students throw bottles at the police boat. Rather than head back to the shore and wait for the police, Steely pulls away in a different direction. The Police re-engage and give chase. Steely beaches the boat by sliding onto a black sand beach. All the students jump off the speedboat and run up the incline making an escape with the rest of the party.

     Florence: 'Don't get yourself into anything you can't get out of child.'

Walks past security into the empty underworld of parking levels—few overnighted vehicles here and there. He goes to where he left Garten's car and gets in. He pulls out a box of smokes and reads the warning label. He smokes a cigarette and begins looking at his teeth in the mirror. Garten's keys are inside as before. He starts the car. He drives normally, calmly, making his way off the corporate campus onto the highway, and getting off at an exit leading to a neighborhood nestled by woods. There is a subdivision ahead of him comprised mostly of high-rises. There's a lake passed.Embed"

Steely's still inside the car, smoking another cigarette as the lift moves upward. Garten's car comes up through the floor, facing Shoobie. There's reflection on the glass behind her, faint speckles of light imply a city view in the distance. Shoobie's seated in a white swivel chair with large perforations. Wide white flooring with a desk complex. Neutral furniture. Fluorescent lights overhead in rails—glass all around. A potted plant caged with a bird. Shoobie sits there in the nude anticipating a party but covers herself once she sees the car. In disbelief she walks toward Steely but continues past him, covering her mouth as she stares at the vehicle.

Steely walks down a ramp into a living space, a bar that looks off into the distance. Outdoorsman photography and console portraits line a wall. A photo of Steely and his dad holding a catch by the sea, another of him climbing a half dome. There's a jellyfish aquarium. The seating area is an ecosystem all its own with more plants and contained living micro systems. He eats pasta and watches television. Once he finishes eating he gets up, undresses, grabs his recall device and heads to the bathroom. Steely walks into a yellow shower. A 3-D projection of a woman in blue washes his back.

Dunk. Break for the curb. Clark taps Steely on the ass, blows him a kiss. Clark shoves him. Steely stumbles and walks over to a vehicle parked on the side. Steely leans on the driver window and kisses the driver. Steely circles to the other side and sits in the passenger seat. Driver puts a dutch to Steely's mouth. Steely hits it. Steely and driver kiss blowing smoke out of their noses.

     Driver (Shoobie): 'Relaxxx...'
     Steely: (Shakes head) 'Awe man—don't do that—I don't even know how it started.' (leans in to kiss her again)
     Shoobie: 'Nope.'
     Steely: (Kisses her face still) 'What you do all day anyway? When'd you even get here?'

Shoobie ignores him, and changes a song on the playlist (she was his ride there in the first place). Steely crawls out of passenger window and talks over the car.

     Steely: 'So what's good for later? I need to shower.'

Matthew and Clark walk over to the car—Danny goes inside to shower.

     Clark: W'sup Shoobie.' (Kisses her on the cheek.)
     Clark: 'So you gon' draw my blood and I can't hit the blunt? You cold.'

Shoobie passes it to Clark.

     Steely: 'Imma be back later I left some shit in your house.'
     Matthew: 'What is it? I'll grab it for you now. You ain't comin' back. Y'all are about to get weird.'
     Steely: 'What an angel—but naw, imma come back though.'
     Matthew: 'Smiley faces...'
Wide road. Canopy of live oak trees and filtered sunlight. Low radio. Engine noise layered with shower scene. Engine noise. Love scene. Engine noise. Cut to black.

Steely is high off endorphins while his back is being rubbed by the lady in blue. He finishes his shower, heads to his bed and crash into sleep. Steely's blurry eyes open up to Shoobie lying next to him with the look of Christmas morning on her face. It's 5am-ish. The glass now gives the views pass up on the level. Shoobie has been dealing with Garten's vehicle for the last several hours.

     Shoobie: 'The majority of Garten's designs contain two access points. It's a motif of his.' 'This design in particular has nearly complete function solely from one key point. The second key point is hidden. I got its location off this thing's own thoughts. Whatever, take a seat.' (Pointing to the car)

Steely takes a seat. Black cup of coffee in his hand. Shoobie has a rainbow coil of wires running from a handheld device into a port on the headlight of Garten's car.

     Shoobie: 'Wait for it.' (As she works)

In a moment Steely's vision through the windshield glows and the city past the woods falls off into sky. His entire surroundings glow golden and white and the edges of his view fall off into endless sky. He seems to be on an island, floating high above any water. Steely jumps a bit, spills the coffee on his boxer shorts. It takes a moment for him to feel the sensation.

     Steely: 'Fuuuck....'

Steely jumps out of the car. Pulling off his burning shorts, eyes affixed to the fantastic view, which is fading back into reality all around him. His vision goes back to normal again. Shoobie smiles. Steely starts to wring out his shorts when he gets a new message notification.

This ain't really relaxing, but okay. So, umm first of all, thank you for your time, BasedGod.
BasedGod: Mr. Ocean, yes sir, thank you.
Frank: You never know what someone's going through they say. What would you say the average commenter looks like on the internet? Let's say you put out a song in like two hours and you go on a blog and there's a hundred comments already... I'm tryna understand what that person is, who is it? Is it everyone around me secretly? I don't know that I know any of them. (Laughter)
BasedGod: When it comes down, it's like, who?? And I wonder that too. I can speak from personal experience, one of my people that I know, he had a video on Worldstar and I wrote some comments and I hated!
Frank: So it was you?! (Laughter) Alrite fsho.
BasedGod: So if you have some comments and they might be a lil personal, it might be your friend.
Frank: So these people are playing, it's just something to do. Not serious.
BasedGod: The scary thing is that some of these people are serious. (Laughter) that's what's scary. The comments give people the chance to say something anonymously, to put whatever they want, frustrations, anything. They could've come back from a long day and just wanna let loose on somebody. This is a real experiment, and it shows you how people are. I know you've heard about the experiment where they test people to see if they would beat up someone who's in jail, and they see if the people would shock someone else if they had the chance and the other person wouldn't know. People were actually shocking other people if they did something wrong, because you didn't see them. They would shock them, but if you could see them, then they weren't doing that. It's a scary thing when you feel like you don't have to see anybody or you have these layers of protection.
Mikey: It's a scary thing.
Frank: That's the real them. That's the real person. At the same time though, people are complicated to the point that nobody is any one thing. Given the opportunity you could be five different Brandons and I could be five different versions of myself—or more. Five is an arbitrary number. The internet is just another experiment showing us more sides of us.
BasedGod: You'll see some girl in the street who's really nice but on the internet is hating. (Laughter)
Frank: Okay, so we were talking about putting out music and I was saying your approach to it is modern. You aren't pinned down by the house rules or...
BasedGod: The norm.
Frank: That corporate America music shit, you know? I feel like the 'Based Way' is a lot healthier, because it's in a flow, unencumbered. To be able to take time and prepare a body of work is great, but overall being free-form with our output is better in the long run, I think. I'd like to be like that.
BasedGod: Congratulations.
Frank: Huh? (Laughter) Thank you.
BasedGod: I come from the traditional sense of music and I did that and I do that, that's what I love doing. I love that. Getting in the studio like where we at right now and doing what we doing, this is what I love. This is legendary. Also I come from making music however it comes because you know it's motherfuckers that need the music because that's all they got and that's what they got. You know we not worried about if it's for club quality. We gon play that full blast in our car or full blast at the house, and shit the club gon play it too, eventually, you know what I'm saying? The hood parties you know, or the local, the local parties or the people gon fuck with you. You know the people gon make that. (Runner brings in a bottle of Johnnie Walker)

Frank: Aye! Thank you.
BasedGod: Shall I open this for you, sir?

Frank: There you go, corporate backing.
BasedGod: You know what I'm saying?! That's what that corporate backing will do forreal!

Frank: You know they'll have that ass on the Johnnie Walker advert.
BasedGod: You gotta put that away, look, if you got some stock in it I'm fuckn w you.
Frank: I don't even know if they did the IPO like that. Nah they over there in Scotland. They got the address on the box right here. We should go see em.
BasedGod: So, look you gotta tell me, cus you be saying words I don't even know. IPO, what does that mean?

Frank: IPO stands for Initial Public Offering, it's when a company makes their product available for trade on the stock market. When they 'go public' so to speak. This comes with letting people know your business, like you gotta tell your shareholders how you did that quarter of that year, you know? You've got people to answer to.
BasedGod: Like why that drop?! Your investment niggas might fake on you. OG like 'Oh, you dropped five percent... I'm leaving,' and you like 'I thought you fucked with me, I thoughtu was my patna?' he like, 'Hmm...'

Frank: It's true though, fiscal responsibility. You've got a board. You could get kicked off the board even if you started it!
BasedGod: That shit's crazy, bruh.
Mikey: They tried to get Bill Gates in trouble, because when he took Microsoft public he bought 35 percent of the shares. He wasn't supposed to do that. I think you're only supposed to be able to get a quarter.
Frank: He needed that.
BasedGod: That's bossed up. So what would be the motivation of making your stock public and then buying 35 percent of it, if you already own it?
Frank: I don't know. More money equals more control I guess.
BasedGod: I'm 'bout to force myself to start loving money.
Frank: I had a conversation recently and the question came up, is money sexy?

BasedGod: You a real one for that bruh, I never.
Frank: My first thing was, 'Yes, money's sexy as fuck.' and my friend's saying, 'Nah, money is gross, it changes hands, it's filthy. People wear it wrong etc.' And I was thinking, 'Sure.' but no, I don't agree with that.
Mikey: I don't either, money is the fuel for options.
BasedGod: I was waiting for that and we can't forget that my brother, we cannot forget. Me, my problem sometimes, you know we all artists in here, and sometimes I'll just be so into my art and just my brand and shit, so fulfilled off getting the art and doing what I do that you forget that you're running a business also. You've got operations and things to keep this business going and to do that you gotta have money, you gotta be making money. You know it costs money to be in this studio. And I'm not the guy that's always putting it on my fans like, 'Hey fuck with me on my Paypal.' putting it on twitter, you know, 'Help the boy!' But it's a blessing too, because when you believe in your brand and you stay solid through the hard days and the times where you might be like, 'I don't know what's goin on dude,' or 'I don't know what's gonna happen,' and people might be saying 'Aww, you fell off.' and shit like that, and you keep going, and you know, then that big paycheck comes out, and you be like, 'Damn!' or, you know, these companies or individuals might come support you. I've been blessed with that. With hard work and stuff, if you really care about what you're doing, people will pay for that and they gon pay that price. And the show money has been going up for me. It's hard because you don't wanna get complacent. You know, 50 grand shows 15,000 something like that, and you unsigned. And you know you gotta split some money up, get your team and business costs to make the show happen. And I'm paying taxes than a motherfucker.
Frank: We all paying em. Trust. (Laughter)

BasedGod: Yea we all are. You just don't wanna be complacent because at first I was just worrying about paying bills. And now bills are paid and motherfuckers is owning things and now it's the next level of career and worldwide.
Frank: Worldwide. Yes.
BasedGod: Yes sir. Pop. You know I feel like i'm embedded in pop culture right now on this level, and that's a blessing where and how far we've come from. A lot of the beautiful people holding me down too. And especially people like ya'll that's just taking ya'll position and not afraid to show love and when ya'll are like on top still show love to people. Because everybody won't do that. Everybody won't be like, 'We still fuck wit B'. I'm like that though, always, anybody that inspires me... I mean you see I followed a million something people by my hand. You know what I'm saying? So it's like niggas can reach me. I made sure. I followed a million (knocks on the table) this hand bruh, I gotta gold-plate it! This is a hand that's followed a million niggas and then wrote a lot. A motherfucker can come talk to me, and I made that so. Cus I'm paying homage too, so I put that out there—anybody can come talk. If you gotta problem or nigga it's real, come talk to me. That's how I feel sir.
Mikey: Influence, also a big marker of success. When you wear something and then hella people wear it you're successful.
BasedGod: Yes, sir. Bless you my love. And thank you. And that's what I've been too. I've been having to deal with that like it's crazy, because I've been so under a microscope it's like... like me, creating a lot of these ideas. And it hurts me as an individual artist, because you'll see people—and I understand this is life though too you know—but you'll see people like an idea that you might've been thinking years on with the music or a brand that you've worked on extremely hard like with the 'Thank you BasedGod' or something like that and then you see motherfuckers stealing shirts and using the brand and not licensing it and not coming to me directly and doing this, and you know, just messing up the brand... I've got trademarks and shit too, so I'm not just out, but I haven't put lawyers on niggas because I'm just seeing how people doing me. And you seeing how people doing me. And that's not right. For me, I don't remember listening to Lil Wayne and being like, 'Alrite imma make a fucking Wayne t-shirt then sell it.' I never been like that. Wayne can do that, I can't and then people got the nerve too. (Laughter)

Frank: They do, they've got the nerve. That's what Mikey's talking about, that's success. Even that, even in that negative, that's a positive. People bootlegging because it means something, it's valuable, on whichever level.
BasedGod: And if you ain't givin' it to em!
Frank: My last record, I didn't make a vinyl. But somebody did and sold a whole lot of vinyl. They had mp3s on it, not properly done at all. Still they'll win because there's a demand for it. That goes back to the business talk we were having about covering your ass. Make sure you can profit from it not just for the sake of profit, but so you can convert that energy to build up your next ideas.
BasedGod: That's truth, bruh.
Frank: Random, but sometimes I prefer my childhood over all this serious adulthood shit.
BasedGod: Hell yeah
Frank: Not saying I wish I was a kid again but...
BasedGod: Well, you know what's crazy? I wouldn't be mad to look like a kid and have the adult mind. You know what I'm sayin? Keep the youthful skin. But you know I love it. I love it. I've finally accepted becoming an adult and really feeling what it means to have knowledge from experience. And for a long time I was really being hard on me. 25 used to always be old to me.  I used to say 'When I'm 25...' and things like that. You know it finally got there, and I'm getting a little further away from the high school. I've been out of high school (counts) I gotta count on my hands!

Frank: Yea man, believe it.
Frank: What year did you write your first book?

BasedGod: I was 19 so that was—uh...
Mikey: 2009.
BasedGod: Yes sir. Good math. He getting that money. Niggas know, I need my assistant nigga. Nigga gotta count for me (Laughter)

Frank: You're an author though. Are you gonna write another one?

BasedGod: Yea, yes I am. I'm definitely—I already got the title.
Frank: You don't gotta give that up right now.
BasedGod: The next interview, when it's closer.
BasedGod: It's gonna be powerful, so I really wanna get back to writing that. Like I just been so excited about making music bruh and like all the shit that I got planned.
Frank: Yea. Are you doing any more lectures anytime soon?

BasedGod: Man, thank you. Well um...
Frank: That's very ahead by the way.
BasedGod: Thank you, I love you for that, thank you. It's the caliber of people that like Lil B, so it's dope people—people in the school system that are smart and that understand the art aspect of it like you said. The modern way I'm distributing art, that was a beautiful way that you worded that... and these people they're getting it, the future. It started at NYU, I got my email out online and the people hit me up and they inquired and every lecture situation was inquired. Like I said, I don't gotta booking agent or manager and stuff like that so I don't have people actively trying to book like, 'Hey, can we book Lil B.' So anybody that wants to book a show from me, they're contacting me personally by email. It started at NYU and that was a huge stepping stone and deep down inside I really felt really good.
Frank: Yea, it was awesome.
BasedGod: Thank you bruh. I'm sounding modest and cool right now, but deep down inside, yea like, especially the MIT one I was really happy, because for me coming up, dude and this is a real emotional thing too. It used to hurt my feelings when people called me stupid back then because I wasn't in school all the time. I was doing what I wanted to do. But I loved science, I loved history and I loved teachers. I can't say I loved all history, but I loved science, off top science, I loved that no matter what. But I also loved teachers that really loved to teach me. And I had a lot of problems early on because I wanted to be a star in the classroom. That's why it makes sense that I'm a rapper because I was always looking for attention. When I raised my hand I knew it was my time in class, you know what I'm saying? I was like, 'Ooh, I can make a joke right now, aww the whole class is looking. I can say something in front of the teacher.' So I was always that guy pulling the school bells and little things like that, getting my respect and freeing the kids. I was freeing all of us. Because I wasn't understanding the magnitude... and the beautiful magnitude, of education. But I did. But it was like when you're a kid, dude... nigga, they got you in there for hours and shit.
Frank: The whole fuckin day man. Missing the sunlight and everything in there (Laughter)

BasedGod: We was blessed cus we had the off campus lunch, so nigga I was gone. We had a chance to go and eat and leave school for lunch, bruh. And that was a blessing and it's a beautiful thing, because you always got to—it's all about the unconscious—unconsciously I always been doing this, however, whatever... it was always music near me. And it stayed to this day. My grades and shit wasn't reflecting how I felt inside, you know my grades if I would've went by grades, you know I... you know, right know I.... I knew. You know what I'm saying? And that's why I cry, you know? Like when I'm listening to my music or I cry for how where I'm at today. Because it's like by the standards I shouldn't be, by the standards... I should be working or something.
Mikey: That's beautiful.
BasedGod: God bless you man.
Mikey: That's like believing in yourself.
BasedGod: Yes sir and thank you. Yea, but back to the root, what was the root kinda. The root?

Frank: Nigga I forgot.
BasedGod: Yea I forgot too.
Frank: I don't know where I was reading it at, but the chain of command in your brain and how it's evolutionary... in the sense of you having a part of your brain that in the progress of human evolution was the first thing to be developed, the brain stem which is said to control involuntary function. Then you have the next level up, which is emotional and survival based, and then above that you have rationale, mathematics and creative writing—all the things we do for a living. That state of the art brain stuff. It was also talking about how it, let's say we were nomads again and we were out here hunting for a living and we were confronted in the woods by a predator, you'll be literally cut off from access to the higher levels. Your brain is designed to cut off reasoning and to go straight to the mode of survival so you don't waste precious time tryna delineate, you just go straight into survival—the real fucked-up part about it is rarely, if ever are we now encountering a bear, but you might encounter a scenario that's actually not life-threatening but that scares you enough to initiate that sort of response and go straight to this lesser developed part of the brain.
BasedGod: Nah, that's the truth. Quote unquote a man and being quote unquote a man and what that means in society and that's what's hard for us. I really wanna protect the women and protect the kids, make sure that ladies know that you can wear gym shorts and not or don't have to feel like you're forced to, because sometimes I wonder if these fashions, these styles that we think are normal are normal... we should be able to see people anyway they wanna be seen and not fantasize about them or fetishize how they look. So it's like, a girl, she might be hot and she has a bunch of hot pictures on Instagram, and I look and be like, 'Oh, she's hot.' and she might put a funny face picture up and I'm like, 'Ew,' like some weird, you know. Just being herself, you know how the girls be doing that just to do some shit and uhh, I had to look at myself and ask, 'What the hell is my problem?' she's human, we're human. Like, because I do the shit too. I put pictures up—and especially now—I'm more comfortable with myself than ever so. You'll put some shit up and it might be an angle or something you not gon try, you not gon take 15 pics. You gon take that one and just put that motherfucker up and let the world see you. We just gotta keep protecting the young me, the young women and also the older people. You can't forget about the older people too. And try to let them know. Just keep on moving these walls and barriers of what it means to be a man or a woman because that shit'll kill you too. If you really try to live by that, you know, being a masculine man like, 'Oh, I gotta protect my wife,' like 'I gotta go hunt for some food.' Why can't she hunt? Or not, and I'm not saying that and imma tell ya'll like this. I been punched by a girl. Girls done punched me. I'll never hit em and that's what's funny to me because you see I'm not the biggest guy and shit—that shit hurt. When the females hit me, that shit hurt. I never hit them back but all this law bullshit they talking about 'A girls. Don't hit girls and shit'... Well, you know what? I never hit a girl before, and they almost knock my ass out and I might have to hit em and sleep they ass because she almost knocked my ass out, so it's like, you know. And trust me I never hit a girl first, ever, ever, never. It was always a girl slapped me because we might be making fun of each other or something—my play sister she slapped the shit outta my ass for making fun of her. And another girl when I was at the club she slapped the shit outta my ass. I didn't know how the club rules worked (Laughter). I was at a strip club or whatever, and I was at the front part and she was dancing, and I wasn't paying I was just looking and I was with my friend, and I think it was my friend's birthday, I took him out on his birthday. This when I was younger I felt I was doing it big, rented the limo and everything, took him out, and man, she smack!

Frank: For not paying?
BasedGod: Yea, lip was bleeding and shit like that. And you know I acted like I was gonna do something, you know what I'm saying? Like I got up and 'Oh okay', and I picked up the chair, looking cool. Picked up the chair like I was gonna do something. And you know, deep down inside I didn't wanna do nothing. You know I wasn't gonna beat her up. But I still did something, I was like 'What?'. Security got my ass out fast than anything, so I really couldn't do nothing anyway.
Frank: I never heard of that. Yea, she was wildin. That's why you came out w the 'Stealing from Strippers' song? (Laughter)

BasedGod: Wildin, that was early. That's why people's wondering why I come out with the song. I got some shit that's gon come out sooner, and it's gonna be like, motherfuckers like, people are gonna be like 'Wow', you know, this 'Thugged Out, Pissed Off' gonna be talking about that, you know beating up bitches and things of that nature, because now to the outside people they might be like, 'Oh, this is horrible.' or misogynistic or whatever it is, but then once you talk to me... this guy never hit a woman but he's been attacked and what he's been through, and then you gotta be like, hmmm well, you know what? I'll speak on shit and then motherfuckers will hit me like, 'Well, you can't speak on shit because you've never been through it.' But you don't know, motherfuckers don't know. Niggas don't know what a motherfucker survived through.
Frank: Yea, true. You know, I've been thinking about something. I've been talking about moving to London since 2012. The only reason I bring that up is because I was always thinking man—this example is stupid, but today I was leaving the hotel, and I was at the elevator and something told me to go back to my room and get some Kleenex because I'm a lil sick and I'll be in the car sneezing and get snot all on my fuckin sleeves and be upset. (Laughter) It's a very simple thing to just go back to the room and get the Kleenex. Yes, I know, I'm already at the elevator, but it's a very simple thing to just turn around and go back to the hotel room get some Kleenex and head back down to the car. A lot of the times though, I'd say, 'Well, self, I'm already over here at this elevator, so im not finna do that.' Then the next thing I know, I'm in the car sneezing and I got snot all on my sleeves. I feel like we know what we're supposed to do, we've got the supreme wisdom. With the whole relocation to London thing, my mind was playing tricks on me. I started to think if I had moved when my intuition first told me to move... then certain shit wouldn't have happened. So now, I always go back to the hotel room. 
BasedGod: Okay, peep this: I was at Starbucks I was getting over this cold naturally I was drinking chamomile tea every day. I don't know what made me buy chamomile tea every day idk. I was like imma buy this everyday just getting over this cold. I was going through the drive thru every day and it was normal for me it became the normal thing so something told me to go inside Starbucks and something made me walk inside and I tried something new, I went and I said lemme try peppermint tea, which changed my life. Healed my cold asap. And I'm like why the fuck I was so stuck on drive thru chamomile tea, and something told me to try something new, and I did it and it felt amazing, and that was my new breakthrough, and when I did it a thought came to my head, and it was about manhood and lifehood and seeing how it's not easy for anybody, like our parents, because they were all our age and they all were just acquiring habits of living, and I was just trying to live when I was buying this chamomile tea every day, I'm like I'm livin, just surviving the day, we're not perfect. You know what I'm saying? So you know you'll give that game to your kids too, you might be drinking chamomile tea every day and if it works for you, you gon tell your son, 'Hey drink this every day. You can drink the chamomile too.' but it showed me when I took the other choice, make sure that you see other options and don't stay just on that one, you know what I'm saying? And don't stay so strict on that one.
Frank: That reminds me, there's an engineer named Jason I worked with on this album. He'll be eating barley you know, raw barley and he'll have the drops on hand to put in the water to make the ph balance and the minerals or whatever, and it occurred to me... see I have friends who are really curious and so whenever they're around new people they tend to ask a lot of questions and like really try and get to know people. As for me, I can be aloof. Not in any cold way I hope, let's say I'm big on giving people their space and not getting all in people's mix, and it just occurred to me recently that I should ask people more questions (Laughter) like 'Jason, when you're not at work what's your breakfast lunch and dinner game plan?' And then he'll say some shit that I didn't know, something I might wanna use for my daily lifestyle. Or what someone is reading, he reads a lot of artist biographies and I'd never asked him, 'Which autobiographies have you read?' like why have I never asked him that, I'm always reading and tryna learn from people who aren't right next to me. Discrimination based off proximity. (Laughter)

Mikey: You know it's a crazy wives' tale about how you wanna start moving on in your career and stuff, doing more and have some more sponsors and people were saying how it's hella easy, like usually you could ask me and you don't even know it. So there's an old wives' tale about diamond mining and this dude found this big old diamond and everybody gathers around him, and are like, 'What the hell? Where'd you find that?' 'It's a big nice diamond. I'm not telling you where I found this,' so everyone starts going to mountains, trees and they start doing crazy stuff, killing animals, opening their stomachs, when really diamonds are right here in the ground. It's crazy that thought sometimes that makes it go crazy.
BasedGod: Just those situations, you know, fuckin w anybody... not being scared to talk to people and ask, you know what I'm saying? Cus when I was overseas and in these other places you know Harlem—Harlem Netherlands or something like that—I was just walking in the shit because I'm foreign, and I didn't care, and it's cool, like a nigga would walk and out here and I have to remember that. Because I feel like there's so many barriers. Niggas was asking me to pull my pants up for so long so I always had these barriers. And I finally had to break the shit down, I'm not different. We're not different. No matter how motherfuckers might try to make you feel. You a legend bruh. You gotta realize I just got comfortable walking in random places, cus like I got money I could do what I want. Like in a way, to an extent, but like for the Base level, you know like niggas could go in anywhere and we could do, even to eat, just say, to eat. So my thing was I was so wrapped up in how I look or how I thought I looked but, nigga like, we should be able to go in any restaurant any place. I used to think and be so into my head and worry about what people thought about me and that used to hinder me. I used to not do as much as I could. Like my nigga why am I still eating fast food? I'm eating fruit all time now, you know it's beautiful, we got the fruit downstairs.
Frank: Yea you told me you went to Whole Foods before you came here. Said you were a lil late because you had to stop at the market and get those fruits and vegetables. (Laughter)

BasedGod: I got another one, here it goes, I ordered a sandwich. I was a little hungry and I automatically flipped on dude like before I even opened it. Like 'Why the fuck is this sandwich not cut?' I opened it a lil bit and it was cut. You just gotta wait sometimes. I tripped like, 'What the fuck. Niggas can't get shit right. This dude.' I just opened it a little bit just waited, wait. Not expecting the worse. And I'm just like 'Boom!'... I'm just a fucking ass
Frank: Dog, what? (Laughter)

Frank: I think we got it man. (Laughter)

BasedGod: This is so great. I'm so glad you made this happen bro.
BasedGod:This was a good one my brother.
Frank: Peace to the God. Thanks a lot. It was great to see you in the flesh.
BasedGod: You think I could take a picture of you bruh on the professional camera?

BasedGod: I'm on my Terry Richardson.5Embed"

Christopher Chassol: (laughs) So basically you're asking me… What I think? I think everything is possible. I think it can be whatever you decide to be; whatever you choose.

FO: Chris, what the fuck are you talking about? you don't understand the question.

CC: The question is what do I think there was before the Big Bang. So I think you can decide whatever you want because we have no clue. We are not astrophysicists; they get religious at the end.

Om'Mas Keith: And this is why there will always be a God principle. When you get to the point where you can't explain everything, the human soul needs to find something because we can't accept not knowing. I'm a scientist. Everything I fuck with has been proven. That's like everything in my life.

CC: Really? Proven?

OK: Right, maths and science. It's like, this shit is real! Only in business and creating though. In love there's no rules. In love, you'll never know anything. Business can definitely know things. You can look at statistics in love and all that shit too, but you'll always derive the fact that you'll never be able to predict anything. I think in business you can use models to predict outcomes. More so that in love.

FO: Wo have you guys gotten the best commentary on yourselves from? Has it been your enemies or your loved ones?

CC: Well it's my girl, of course. I do music to please girls, you know? At the beginning you do it for her to love me, because I want to shine in front of her.

OK: Like a diamond.

CC: I'm doing music for her to feel proud of me.

FO: You know that song, ""shine bright like a diamond?"" You don't know that song?

CC: No, it's from a movie? I don't know? Maybe, maybe—it's a girl? Like Miley Cyrus? I don't know, I'm not an entertainer.
OK: My mother used to always say weird shit to us, basically saying like we were a very select group of people in the hood who had some consciousness and were trying to get out. And she would always make those weird statements to reinforce that, I don't even want to repeat what she said because it doesn't sound good. Basically, telling me that I should rise above what was going on in the neighbourhood. To this day, just how ambiguous your parents or elders around you can be, my mother, my grandmother, they'd always say stuff like 'you're from here, but you're not of here.' Just a repeated mantra, always. 'Each one, teach one.' so when I talk to my mom it's all these paraphrases and lessons. When I talk to my grandmother, it's always this wisdom. Everybody older than me are the ones who really give me the commentary as I move forward.

CC: When we were talking, I was thinking of echoes in your life or phrases that people say when you are young… Phrases that stay. Short ones that constitute your vision. There was one guy, I was 20 and in a band. I was good, but I was not super good. The guy was and older guy in a bar. He said, 'Yeah, pretty good, your concert, but you don't have the sound.' I was really pissed off. I knew he was right and this phrase—I don't even know who this guy is, I met him ten seconds—but this phrase stayed to remind me that I'm not there.

OK: I had one guy do that. This is a pivotal moment in my beat-making life. I was 16, I made these beasts and prepared them for this gentleman called Weldon Irvine who was a famous jazz musician. He came to my house, listened to my beats, and I knew they were great but he shot me down, like 'yeah they're a little busy bro.' It was my first shit of honesty that prepared me for what was going to come for the rest of my life. I always go back to that one scenario of people having that one opinion. You can let it destroy you, you have to add it to your repertoire and think about it. When he said that, I thought to myself, maybe there's a way to do things simple. I'm still on a quest for that to this day in my life, that level of simplicity, because of this interaction with Weldon.

FO: When I used to sing when I was younger, my mom would be like, 'stop hollering!' It used to make me all self-conscious about how I sounded, like my tone of voice or how loud I was, and I didn't want to sound like I was dying and shit. And then I discovered Prince at my mom's friend Jheri's house, I mean she used to have him on like everyday and I honestly didn't pay attention at first but I vividly remember the first time I heard 'Beautiful Ones' and this grown man singing for his life. Immediately I remember it clicking like, 'oh, it's okay to holler and scream and everything. Like, express yourself kid… Go off! So yeah, Prince basically made it all okay. (Laughter) And I mean there was other stuff like my grandfather always correcting my speech, which was a regular thing. But for some reason I remember I was picking up a habit of saying, 'yes, indeed.' And like really stretching it out too which sounded country as hell. I think I was picking it up from my older twin cousins or whatever and he wasn't having it, at all. Low-key I think he's the reason why I never picked up a strong New Orleans accent for real, which I kind if wish I did. I guess I could turn it on if I tried to but yea in general I probably just sound like I'm from anywhere in America.

OK: Talking like black people, what does it mean?

FO: Yeah, I heard that growing up sometimes. 'Oh, you talk white.' But you know what it means though.

OK: In the context that I grew up when I was told to talk white it was because I took the time to make sure everybody understood every word and used big words.

CC: It's about putting the white guy on the side of the intellect and putting the black guy on the side of the intuitive, primitive things. 'Oh, his language swings.' (snaps fingers). 'It's close to dance. Close to the animals, to nature!' The white guys speaks clearly like the brain. It's doing this when people say 'talking like white people' and 'talking like black people.' It's so stupid.

OK: That's at the core. So why are people still doing that right now? Still! In fifth grade saying to another kid, 'Why you talk black?' Why you talk white? Wigger!'

FO: True. But it's all changing all the time. There'll be new cultures that collide like this in the future and this will be old news.

OK: Do you like being alone?

CC: Yeah, I love it.

OK I hate being alone. I love to have so many people around me, much as I can. I like to have people sleeping in my house.
CC: I like my toilet. I need my space.

OK: No, everything's separate. You can't use my toilet. (laughs) I like an environment where I'm in my world and there are people in the house, I don't know what it's about, but I like having people around me. I like entourage. I think I'm going to have a big entourage, really big.

FO: I'm not that way.

OK: You can be alone, huh?

FO: Yeah. I can be alone. But remember I used to have a bunch of people around my house all the time. All the time.

OK: Trusted crew, though?

FO: Eh, some randoms too.

CC: And people staying over and they wouldn't leave?

FO: Some people wouldn't leave, they'd just be there.

CC: So you're like 'so, so…' (claps hands on knees) '… What are we doing?'

OK: Do people do this at your flat?

CC: Yeah, they stay because the place is good. So I'm like 'So so so… I have to work… blah blah blah.' They won't leave! Being alone is good. With this, the invention of the iPod, it changed everything. You have all things, all of this music everywhere. The Proustrian feeling, the feeling of nostalgia, you can bring nostalgia in a place where you have never experienced it before. You had Walkmans but the iPod changed everything.

OK: Data revival. That's what brings those feelings. Seeing it, it gives you unlimited… It's like fucking drugs, man.
CC: I love good nostalgia. Nostalgia that goes for a while. It's crazy when music is so powerful. It can still be technical and poetic, like 'I know which chord makes me feel about Wednesday afternoon in 1983.' Think like that. You could almost make an Excel document about it.

OK: Take for instance, every time I hear 'Don't Forget About Me' from the Breakfast Club. Whenever I immediately hear that song, I get this immediate image of being; because the only time I saw this movie was on WPIX11 [news] in syndication and it would come on Saturdays once every three months or something like that… But I always remember catching it at home on a Saturday, 11 years old. It takes me right back to that time, every time.

Zing Tsejeng: Do you think people are nostalgic these days?

OK: I don't know.

CC: No, I don't think so.

I am eleven but she stoops on account of my painting ability and my bank account. Truly I am prodigious at art. I have had four shows that sold out even  before the door were open. Mahmoud says the Lady Who Made Me bought them all. Mahmoud is a liar and an incontinent. He is also my best friend. The Lady Who Made Me drinks port until her planet looks bright. I pay the gas bills.

My dealer is named Fenton. It happened once that I fell asleep on a palette and Fenton sold it for enough to remodel our kitchen. I was not proud. I severely reprimanded him with the aid of my elbows. Recently, he has been thieving items from my room, dubbing the 'Hope in Candyland’, and 'Sink', and ’Cat Call', and whatnot, and selling them to businessmen for extortionate sums. His house is as big as three houses. He says my sloth-like manner of painting injures us both. Yesterday, he suggested employing a team of people to paint on my behalf. We were sipping chair at the office. Again, I forcibly ejected the idea from his brain with physical violence.

I work exclusively in oil and on a large scale. I paint on average eight hours a day. The highest price ever paid for a piece of my work was £215,000. The piece was titled Dear Mum,Please Go Back In Time And Abort Me. They buyer wished to remain anonymous but failed to do so and was later identified by the Daily Mail as a Congolese kleptocrat named Patrice.

Today Carissa met me at the school gates the same way Carissa always meets me at the school gates. With her lips, she sucked up a reef of the busted blood vessel on my neck. I noticed we were being dogged by a man with a skull-sized camera  strapped to his ribs and I lobbed my lunchbox at his head and he went away.
We continued with Mahmoud on the motorway bridge. He came with double malt beer and a fax machine. Once the beer was gone, we scrolled through the passing cars, looking for a suitable target. The fax machine was a sizeable crater in what Mahmoud insists was a Bugatti. I told him he was blind. He told me he was lumpy.

""Kimchi,"" I said, on account of it being our safe word.

Cars are art but so is destroying expensive things that don't belong to you.

Carissa cradled me like a baby and carried me to safety as the supposed Bugatti driver emerged to holler at the clouds above. Carissa is twenty. A palm reader once promised she was immortal. Truly she is the most angelic being either side of the Thames. There are times when she makes me forget the impossibility of a higher power.

Partial list of misappropriated hood ornaments in my current collection: 12 Mercedes tri-stars, 4 broken chains of Audi rings, 1 Rolls Royce Spirit of Ecstasy, 2 leaping Jaguars, 1 custom chrome skull with red glass eyes.

I left school at elven this morning and had Calabassi drive me to the studio. Attendance is not mandatory for the prodigious on account of our futures  lying above the sad tracks of exam papers and whatnot. Our superpowers cannot be learned from books because they're already inside us, waiting to be dug out.

I recommenced work on a 6' x 4' reimagining of the Last Supper in which ever face is my face and every meal is me. Truly I am modest but I am also fair and I think it is a work of genius. Fenton and me admired it while sipping tea and shucking pistachios.

Carissa arrived at four. She looked as though she'd spent the dat being waterboarded. I offered her tea. She screamed when I tried to touch her.

""What is it?"" I said. She pelted my clavicles with her open hands.

""I wish you didn't exists,’ she told me. She left.
I ventured off to drink beer and empty my skull of tears on the motorway bridge. I was recognised by a middle aged man who attempted to photograph me with his phone until I smacked my bottle and chased him with the jagged remains. Truthfully, I am grateful to be remembered. But I want to be alone.

Aggressive tendencies, an unrivalled ability to concentrate for long periods of time, and an impressive vocabulary means that many adults have suspected some kind of disorder at work in my brain. I failed the test for autism twice. The only thing wrong with me is me.

It was Friday when Carissa ate my heart. Today is Monday. I spent the entire weekend in the studio, chewing coffee beans to stay awake and pitching paint at giant canvases.

It did not work.
I made nothing.

My new paintings look like the paintings of an eleven year old. All of them gutter-balls. My notoriety and future are heavily dependent on me being an eleven year old whose paintings do not look like the paintings of an eleven year old. I have made a list of the tallest buildings in the city. Not only did I fail to produce anything new, I squandered several promising works in progress with zigzags and failure to keep colour where it should be. I draw stick people now. Women with triangles for dresses. Suns with smiling faces. It’s all over I am going to sleep.

Fenton woke me with a soft jab to the cheek and immediately began extolling my efforts. He spun in circles, gesturing with his clammy hands, leaking spit like a lawn sprinkler. He called it a whole new kind of primitivism. He said it was the most exciting work I'd had produced. He vomited large numbers, promising we’d become richer than we already are, and attempted to embrace me. I kicked him in the shin.

I told him they were the worst, and I was the worst, and the paintings would be used as fuel for a colossal bonfire around which I would dance naked save for a waterproof poncho. He commenced the hailing of many Marys. He told me I was insane. Three times he asked me whether I would set money alight.

""No,"" I told him. ""Probably not.""

""Then I imply you to let me have them,"" he said.

I upper cut his ball sack and left him for dead.

Later I returned to the studio and, with the aid of my driver, Calabassi, proceeded to remove every canvas and board. We relocated them to my bedroom. I laid him off with a generous severance package and triple locked my door. A metal grill has now been fitted. I am not coming out.

The first painting I sold was a 4' x 4' oil on wood depiction of The Lady Who Made Me getting explicit with a gang of great apes. It was titled 'Hopes For The Future"". Every newspaper jumped. The Man Whose Sperm Is In My Foundation was around then. His hobbies included beer and bed and online poker. Six times since leaving he asked me for money via requests written on Birthday cards sent on day that are absolutely not my birthday. I sent them straight back. I am not interested.

It is more important now that ever to continue on with the expansion of my collection of car ornaments. I cannot paint but I can repurpose. Last night when the sun left, I exited through the window and commenced hunting for suitable vehicles.
After my first show, I bought our current house specifically because it lies in a wealthy area studded with impressive cars. Some cars have retractable mascots. Most do not. Badges are fairy easy to chip off but difficult to remove in one piece. BMWs are the biggest challenge. A thin chisel is needed. I do not know why but Mercedes tri-stars come off the easiest. I have mugged several cars in the area multiple times. Now their owners are getting their replacements fixed on with Araldite to prevent them from doing do.
Anyways I only managed an Alpha Romeo and the foot of a Peugeot lion. My heart was somewhere else.

Nine missed calls from Mahmoud. Nineteen missed calls from Fenton. Six hundred and fourteen unread emails.
Today I thought of Carissa and her breasts and the way she flaps her hands when she’s excited and I screamed all manner of sadness at The Dog Star.

The little lump of meat that is me had multiple appearances on breakfast TV, late night TV, lunchtime talk radio, and a celebrity cooking show in which I attempted to make a risotto and found that I could not. There are people besides Fenton in charge of who I am. A woman named Louise is tasked with making me look as young as possible at all times to keep my prices high. Once I arrived at a show in New York with beer on my breath and she made me chew fifteen tablets of gum before engaging in any conversation. You're eleven, she told me. I know, I said. That night three women accompanied me to my hotel room and we played Yahtzee until I fell asleep. I felt like a minor deity.

The Lady Who Made Me spent her entire day fist fighting with my bedroom door. She begged me to come out. She told me I was being selfish  and that I needed to get ready for the show. She made mention of glass chalets on Lake Como, Apple watches, and an ultra-rare Armagnac  that re-dates the Boer War. Fenton had been whispering at her through phones.

""Surrender."" she shouted.

""Never,"" I shouted back.

Various slices of processed meat were pushed beneath the door to keep me from dying. Chorizo, serrano, Ibérico, salami, pastrami, ham, Parma ham, corned beef. She passed out against my door. Fenton came and shifted her body out of the way. He came with some form of professional negotiator who made me promise on everything that I was not tying nooses or swallowing pills.

""Just give me something,"" Fenton pleased. ""Anything. The gallery are asking questions.""

""I want Carissa,"" I told him and then I went quiet.

Fenton did not relent. He continued to scrawl noted on Rizla papers and push them into my personal space.

I Carissa did not want me to exist, then I do not want to exist. If I cannot paint, I will not pretend to paint. I will eat pastrami. I will abort the coming days.

Notes received from Fenton:
Please just fall asleep on more palettes.
Bad shows are better than no shows.
You'll be forgotten faster than breakfast.
If you want to know the truth I am afraid. The majority of child prodigies grow into competent but unexceptional adults. I want to be the most exceptional of all the adults. I want to be selected for the first Mars expeditions. I want newly discovered species of jungle moth to be named after my name. I do not want to continue and fade and shrink like something pedalling away at the end of a mediocre evening.

Mahmoud's face appeared behind my window right when I was on the verge of sleeping. I told him to disappear but he'd come carrying medium-rare Aberdeen Angus steaks and also gun. We ate cross-legged on the floor. Truthfully I was getting sick of being alone. I am the most social out of all the animals and I had not seen even one face for a whole week.

""What did you do?"" I said.

""Handstands,"" Mahmoud said. ""You?""

I gestured at the walls. They are adorned now with every car badge I stole. I glued them into a kind of scale pattern. It looks like the skin of a robot shark.

We drank and ate and left via the window in order to search out the adornments of cars. Mahmoud is indiscriminate. He left with two Renaults. We drank and broke and what we could break.

""You okay?"" Mahmoud said.

""I don't want to do it,"" I said.

""I know. But what else?""

""Kimchi,"" I said.

I donated my phone to the clouds and sprinted home.

Fenton may have taken up residence in my house. Every morning he's at my door, promising boats and gold and what not. At noon The Lady Who Made Me joins him. She swallows beer for breakfast. He get frantic. They want me out. They want more smiling suns. They want anything.

""No,"" I scream for the nine thousandth time.
""If you don't create, you'll die,"" Mahmoud said, in a pitiful attempt to reignite his most lucrative steam of income.

I argued with Mahmoud for three hours about which Wes Anderson film is the best Wes Anderson film. Truly he is doomed if he is not convinced it is Rushmore. He said Fenton had been selling crumbs of plaster from the studio. He advised me to release a formal statement. I agreed.

I chewed my toenails.
I made a cape from the curtain.
The planet felt so small.

Conversation held with Fenton through the keyhole:
""I can't paint.""
You don't have to.""
""I want to.""
""Throw me out some things from your room.""
""Cancel the show.""
You're throwing it all away.""
""I'm allowed to throw it away if I want to. It's mine.""
""Please don't.""
""Cancel the show, you idiot piece of shit, and fuck off out my house.""

'11 year old artist Elliot Vostock today announced his retirement in a statement relayed to the Guardian by telephone. It has been rumoured that the child prodigy has isolated himself completely for the past two weeks, ahead of his upcoming show at M. It is unclear whether or not the show will go ahead. When asked for a comment, his art dealer Charles Fenton began to sob and shadowbox the space around him. More details to follow.'

There were journalists outside the house today. I hailed them with coffee cups until they went away. Police came. Police left. I allowed Fenton into my room. He told me I'd done it. He bowed to the wall of his car badges. His eyes burned and he bounced on the spot. He was more excited that I've ever seen him.

""You can't take them,"" I said. ""They're stolen.""

""It's found art,"" he said, phone pressed to his ear.

The first time I drew it was to make Mahmoud laugh. We'd both been dismissed to the corridor following a most raucous read-through of some dumb sonnet. I drew our red-cheeked teaching attempting to engage in self-fellatio. Fenton discovered me when I was nine.  After that we got rich and it was hard to go outside.

I am leaving. Mahmoud is coming too. And the Lady Who Made Me. We'll be going somewhere calm and tropical. Somewhere with white sand and rum. I won't paint. I want to learn to fix brains or lungs, or I design cars, or make sushi.

Today I made nothing and did not die.Embed"

Don't move a muscle, stay exactly where you are
They took my friend
They cuffed his wrists
They beat him in their van
He hadn't done a thing
But when they came, of course he ran
And they pursued and they were rude
And he said nothing
He bit his lip
'Cause if you speak, you'll feel their feet
But if you don't
You'll still get hit

[Refrain]
What's the matter with you
My lovely brown eyed man?
How come I can feel you shaking
When I take you by the hand?
What's the matter with you
My lovely brown eyed man?
How come I can feel you shaking?

[Verse 2]
They want me bad, now bad I'll be
They keep me poor
They make me sick
They feed me with desires for
Things that I don't need or want
Stick their needles in my arms
Expensive things I can't afford
They show me rooms furnished with gold
And then they close the doors
You might also like[Refrain]
What's the matter with you
My lovely brown eyed man?
How come I can feel you shaking
When I take you by the hand
What's the matter with you
My lovely brown eyed man?
How come I can feel you shaking?

[Verse 3]
I'm the child of the gimme-more nation
When they want something
They launch an occupation
They plunder and they pillage
They call it liberation
They're bombing and maiming
Stealing and taking
But they lock me up
And they paint me a demon
For trying to do right by my beautiful children
They're killing for money
They're crippling countries
They're just doing it all
Beneath the flag that says
Freedom
Now, what's the matter with you?
You're lying if you think
That my pain isn't your pain
Because when I'm hit, you flinch

FA: When did you realize you were a car guy? When did you feel that it wasn't just something you kinda cared about?

EC: Let me give you an example, I found this piece of paper, during a school exercise in second grade, about what you wanted your family to be and what you wanted to be when you grew up, and I wrote that I wanted to be a car designer, which was funny because after I studied car design I found this piece of paper again and I was like ""Oh my god! This is crazy."" I would've never thought I was interested in cars for so long.

FA: If money was no object, what car would you pick? You can pick one-offs.

EC: *Long silence* I'd have to pick—and currently it might sound kinda like a cliché—but I swear it's been my pick for a long time, the Ferrari 250 GTO.

FA: What do you think about modern cars in general, do you think cars are losing their 'soul'?

EC: Well, you know, on one hand I feel like, it may be hard to say because we're living in the period where it's hard to say what lived on from [the old classics] but, on the other hand, they're constantly turning in cars that the consumer wants, so you're constantly adjusting the car for the various world markets. I like the fact that brands now are to starting to recognize that 'Soul' people that want. I feel BMW is going back to that a little bit, you know, trying to 'Purify' their sports cars, because they've had fast cars, but it's been a while since they had a proper sports car.
FA: What did you do to your E36? Was it 100 percent stock when you got it?

EC: The car was relatively stock, it had ugly wheels on it and other little aftermarket interior pieces, but I liked it because it wasn't really beat up. First thing I did was to take a lot of weight out of it, I did suspension, tyres, better cooling so it could survive on the track, I tracked it here and there but it was still my daily driver... sometimes I would just have one seat in it and my friends would give me shit because I couldn't carry anyone at all.

FA: Did you work on your car by yourself? Or maybe your dad helped you from time to time?

EC: Yeah, my dad helped me getting most of the work done.

FA: Frank told me you did some interesting stuff to make it lighter, what did you do?

EC: You can get pretty creative you know, you can cut out a lot of things and whatever structural rigidity you compromise by losing weight, you want to reinforce with the structure of the roll cage, which I feel like it was done really well in my car. I was able to cut out a lot of the inside of the car in addition to the interior stock parts and everything. I was able to save a whole lot of weight. I got the car down to almost 2500lbs and as far as changes that are gonna happen soon, I'm gonna change the entire suspension geometry so I'll be able to cut off the fenders and put on bigger tyres.

FA: You're running stock size wheels?

EC: No, no, I'm running 255, stock is like 235, so this would allow me to run something like a 275 with slicks, which would be pretty sweet.

FA: And also widebody always looks better.

EC: Yeah, that's my inspiration there *points at E36 GT3 poster*

FA: Favorite race track in the world?

EC: It's funny I've never been to either of them, and I don't know which one I prefer, but I'll have to go with Spa and the Nürburgring. Can I leave those at a tie?

FA: I know you watch racing, what's your favorite category?
EC: I love endurance racing, I like V8 Supercars a lot and DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) too, even though I didn't really enjoy the last 2 seasons. I've never missed a single Formula 1 practice, qualifying or race, so I guess you can say Formula 1 is my favorite. But in terms of excitement, nothing can beat old-school races. I watch a lot of '90s DTM because it's kinda like going back in time and reliving '90s racing.

FA: Favorite racing driver of all time?

EC: Oh man, I wasn't expecting this question. I've never been asked this question before. Nelson Piquet, I've always been a big fan of him. Obviously, I'm a big Senna fan too but… I'll have to go back to this question. *laughs*

FA: How many times did you race at Willow Springs? Do you go there often or do you just go for big events?

EC: I don't do much testing there because it's not much of a technical track, but I'll probably go there about 10 times a year on average.

FA: Do you only ever use your E36 there?

EC: Yeah, only the E36, it's only an hour and a half away so it's no big deal.

FA: Okay, Frank said that sometimes you race without a racing suit and you just wear a Hawaiian shirt or something like that.

EC: I've only done that once! *laughs* It was really hot that day and it wasn't like, wheel-to-wheel racing so there's less of a chance of ending up in a deadly firey wreck so it's one of those days where teams go and test their cars and… yeah… I've only done that a couple times but I won't do it anymore!

FA: About the 2002, tell me about it.

EC: The car was stock when I got it, stock wheels, the wiring was updated as well as the alternator and the cooling system, just for reliability purposes. I trimmed the bumpers down because of course it had the big ugly US-Spec bumpers so I shortened them a little bit. I didn't do anything else before selling it.

FA: Is there any new car that you like? I don't necessarily mean a car that you would like to own, just a car that you really like that came out recently.

EC: I'm glad you asked me and I really wanna know what you wanna say about it. The new [BMW] M3 looks better than the new M4, to you have agree with this?
FA: Yeah, you're right, I don't get this whole renaming thing with the M3 and the M4 but whatever, it does look better, I would totally own a white M3.

EC: But if I could get a recent car now, it'll be a [Porsche] 991 GT3 RS.

FA: What do you think about the fact that it doesn't come with a manual?

EC: I wasn't surprised. I was sad, but I wasn't surprised. It was predictable.

FA: True, it's not like Porsche is doing it on purpose just to annoy purists, it's just that the engines and everything else are starting to be unsuitable for cars like that.

EC: Yeah, look at the Ferrari F430 with the 6-speed, there's videos on YouTube of people trying to drive them and it's just too much of a hassle, changing gears takes 2 seconds or more and you can see they're not enjoying the car at its full potential.

FA: What about floppy paddles vs stick shift, what do you think about that? Do you still prefer cars with an old-school transmission? Or it doesn't really matter to you?

EC: Not necessarily, I mean I would obviously still prefer a standard 6-speed over floppy paddles, to be honest, I don't think that even in high-end supercars the double-clutch system is even there yet, I think people mistake them for the sequential boxes on race cars. For example, they see a Porsche GT3 Cup Car and they think that their Audi AS has the same type of transmission like, ""Hey, I'm a race driver,"" so they take it to the track just to find out that you don't have the same freedom that you would have with a standard 6-speed as far as doing things like shifting from 5th to 2nd, and it would also overheat faster than a 6-speed. So yeah, I don't care if the upshifts are 0.2 seconds faster than a 6-speed, I would still prefer the old-school way. I mean, you can still have a pure driving experience with floppy paddles but you would miss that type of engagement that you have with a manual.

FA: What is your favorite era of racing?

EC: Definitely the late '80s, early '90s, with the DTM and the BTCC (British Touring Car Championship), and also the rally scene being more restrictive after they banned Group B cars.

FA: If BMW didn't exist, what would you go for?

EC: Well, Porsche? *laughs*

FA: I was actually about to say, what if BMW and Porsche didn't exist?

EC: Oh man, I'd say Mercedes then. I like their engines, especially their 6.2L V8. Brutal, reminds me of American muscles.

FA: What is, in your opinion, the best all-round car, for either driving around, having fun, going shopping, whatever?

EC: I'd say a Volvo station wagon. I've always liked them as a company and they're very safe, which is always good, and I think they're cool.

FA: Well, wow, I was expecting something like a CTS-V wagon or an MS wagon, that's a strange pick.

EC: Maybe I was factoring too many things like MPG and stuff like that, so yeah.

FA: Best engine ever made, in your opinion?

EC: Umm, Cosworth has built some nice engines. I would obviously still prefer a standard 6-speed over floppy paddles, to be honest, I don't think that even in high-end supercars the double clutch system is even there yet...
FA: Okay, I know it's not easy, so let's just do best engine for road cars.

EC: Road cars, well, okay… probably the S42, which was BMW's race version of the M42 that they used in their 318i in the BTCC, they were pretty rad. I think they used the same block in Formula 1, but I also like the Mercedes 16V Cosworth motor.

FA: I thought you were gonna say the M120, because to me, that's one of the greatest engines ever made.

EC: Yeah, I guess I'm just being a little too BMW-wise *laughs*, but it's definitely a hard question. I don't know how to answer. Either the S42 or the S14.

FA: What do you think about rotary engines?

EC: I don't know, they're interesting, light and compact, but they just wouldn't work. Nowadays, they're not very reliable, and they lack torque, and they also get pretty bad MPG.

FA: Oh, right, what is your favorite special edition BMW?

EC: Probably the E9 CSL. It was basically the road-legal version of the race car for the public.

FA: Yeah, the ""Batmobile."" It was also super-expensive at the time, that's why it's so rare.

FA: What is your favorite car at the (2015) Geneva Motor Show?

EC: I don't know, the Koenigsegg was cool. It's just so cool, I love the wrap around the windshield, it reminds me of the old Group C cars.

FA: What's your favorite muscle cars? I mean you're American, you need to have a favorite muscle car.

EC: Umm, I can talk about muscle cars. I like Chevelles, old Nova's like, '65 Nova's, probably a good old '55 Chevy like the one my uncle used to race. But I can't really pick a favorite amongst these.

I was going to ask Evan a bunch of other questions but I've been up all night in Italy and I haven't slept a single minute on my flight to LA, so we just chatted for a bit… mostly about cars as you can imagine, but I was also curious about LA, so we chatted about the differences between it and from where I'm from.

I was stressing that, where I'm from, things are way different than in Los Angeles, to start off, we don't actually drive, nice cars, and by nice, I mean fast, and nobody is really interested in them, so it was pretty much the first time where I could exchange opinions with an actual car guy in real life. Before this interview, my only way to communicate with car aficionados was via Tumblr or Facebook.

I also met his father prior of the interview and he was as cool as his son, and he was also very much into motorsport, and speaking about motorsport. The 24 Hours Nürburgring race was being held when I was in LA, which was kind of a reality check to me since Evan turned on the TV to check out the race and it was daytime in Germany while it was about 11pm in LA. My first thought was that it was being rebroadcast, but then I realized that I was in the other side of the world and for some reason that really struck me because I was just realizing how far I was from my time zone, precisely 9 hours, and it had never happened up until now where I was watching a major endurance race from the other side of the world.

I'm still a bit sad that I couldn't make it in time to see him race the E36, but it was my first time in Los Angeles and, to be honest, I was simply overwhelmed with the car scene here.Embed"

when it rain it fills up with rain
my boyfriend he gon pick me up
don’t distract him at the wheel
in his lane
he’s the only one

my boyfriend he misses me when i’m gone
so he don’t forget me
there’s a song he sings
calms his nerve, endings
my boyfriend is friendly
and we don’t want no problems

i could say that i’m happy
they let me and my boyfriend become married
i could say that i’m happy
but cross my heart i didn’t notice
hope to die no never, we voted
me and my boyfriend cast our ballot
every kiss reads like a poem
making wrongs right like a poem

i couldn’t say i dream of you
because my dreams are filled with no one
and all is lost
me and my boyfriend we found
we don’t hope for beyonds at all
me and my boyfriend spend time
and that’s all i’m holding on
this time
we got permission
nothing’s above condition
but this ain’t a thang
it’s a mission

can’t join the band so sing along
me and my boyfriend got it going on
sleep with fans and t shirts on
asleep in vans your legs all strewn
across my lap
tan lines where your watch was strapped
you took off to make time

cut your hair
you left it so long
i love to stare
there’s nothing wrong
and if i die while i’m asleep
i pray to God my boyfriend
keeps my secret

A scrim of light covered the windshield and enlarged a web browser with my most visited sites and applications, including Parlor, the only dating app that properly interfaces with driverless cars. I scrolled to its home page - a menu of photos and videos of possible dates - and opened my inbox to see who had messaged me since I’d last logged on that morning: seven users, almost all of them bots. One wrote to me in a garbled English: $$$ now. Red light that is yours for keeping sir Another: make or act fast as soon as you READ this. I am convincing you my friend. Another: Yours now free Euros Swiss Francs British Pound Sterling yes And Now. All if you, sir, administer your account. I deleted the messages and scrolled through the rest before stopping at one from a profile named @_Monica23: Hi. How are you? I replied: Hi. She lived in Oak Park, the other side of town, and checked no car as a conditional stat. I messaged her again: What are you up to tonight?

I never liked to drive. With the sophistication of self-driving technology and its cheap implementation in the past few years, things changed. I prefer the ease of driverless protocol with its open sense of spatiality, lying down in the backseat to watch TV while outside everything continues to slip past, eliding destination and surface into a liquid state of travel, distance flattened to a frictionless, horizontal plane, the slide toward point B. Riding in cars is easy. Romance, social-networked for idle moments mid-commute, is easier. The proliferation of dating apps - with their universal binaries of choice - followed the popularity of reality dating shows in the 2000s, where prayerful hope of a partner was regimented in network-produced pageantry, imaging interpersonal complexity as a series of recycled gestures and “challenges.” While reality TV is more or less dead, we can all play The Bachelor online. With Parlor, we can play it in our cars. Hey. Hey. Hi. How are you?

In The Bachelor, which broadcasts though almost no one watches it anymore, courtship follows the accelerated logic of the elimination game, rendering “true love” an antiquated if not totally imaginary idea, one referent in a system that has otherwise reduced all feelings to a series of staged make-outs in the hot tub and dinners on the deck overlooking the 9th hole. Like, although dating remains gently gorgeous and fragile in the presence of all those cameras, hovering over the women vying for the Bachelor’s attention, it’s easy to get lost in the mess. “Honey, you look lost,” one woman says to another, who, in becoming her target, looses face, her otherwise calm expression breaking into a nervous grimace in recognition of the accumulating losses presented by each bad date with the Bachelor, a man whose good looks and generic dress leaves him nearly faceless. A masculine composite that never coheres beyond he’s so hot, open shirt with a bit of chest hair, “razor-sharp jawline,” and yet who remains by virtue of the game an elusive object of desire. She sits up, regaining her composure, and winks at her competitor across the dinner table. I’m not lost, she things, looking into the camera.

The interior of the Bachelor’s house is always open, a spacious domestic array of luxury couches to fall on and talk, open windows, a pool, and a large kitchen. Spotlights managed by hired specialists isolate both happiness and discomfort whenever it’s felt. Everyone is seen. Regardless of the show’s disorienting arrangement, she doesn’t feel lost, rather force-marched to the denouement of ter brief, televised romance with a moderately wealthy man, vaguely sensing the path that will lead her to the finale, if he permits her. In the mean time she will never be alone with the Bachelor until he proposes to her and they depart together in the luxury driverless car that will await them at the entrance of the mansion, drone cameras poised overheard to capture the moment. She often dreams of the finale,of turning to wave to the mansion that housed them and her defeated competitors. They will offer the public a kiss in tribute to the losers when they leave. Sensing this, the car’s windows will slowly roll up and self-tint.

Hi. How are you?

I’m going out. What are you doing tonight? @_Monica23 wrote to me. The dashboard beeped when the message was received, flashing Parlor’s logo - a cursive P circled in a shimmering loop extending from its base - on the windshield.

Nothing, I responded. U?

Oh yah? No plans on a Thursday?? Lol.

:(

Want to meet up? Come to this party. It’s called Shush. It’s this girl Abhor’s party. It’s on the north side. Belmont Avenue area. At Shore Club if u look it up.

k.

I leaned my head against the driver’s window and fiddled with the car’s web interface as it located a parking spot outside the Shore Club. I swiped to Parlor and found @_Monica23. Her profile pic featured her sitting next to friends in the grass in a park, everyone’s faces blurred except hers. A dot beside her name indicated that she was online. Hey, I wrote. I’m here. I waited a few minutes for her to respond. No response. Finally, the dot went red: she was offline.

The car found a parking lot a block away from the Shore Club and directed itself to a narrow spot at the far end, between a motorcycle and an Audi. It eased itself in between them, adjusting itself with surgical precision as it crept forward. When it stopped, the car shut itself off. I exited into the chill October air and the door locked behind me. I headed for the entrance of the lot, where a few people stood nearby, talking and smoking: “It’s OK, yah,” one said. “You should check it out. I mean, it’s definitely fun.”
A huge crowd had gathered at the entrance of the Shore Club, which was guarded by a bulky man who’d folded his arms in seemingly total indifference to the urgent flurry before him. He didn’t speak except to occasionally shout that everyone needed to stay in line and not linger outside the bounds of the rope. People pushed to get to him and the doorwoman to insist that they were on the list, but he ignored them, resolutely focused on a wall of graffiti across the street. When anyone pushed the limit of the rope he’d break his concentration to yell that they could step back or leave, his frustration so rehearsed it seemed deprived of any real anger, just canned words that had been paired down to a basic, agitated command that would be universally understood: “Get the fuck back.” I thought maybe he was ready for the night to be over. A tattoo of a drone swaddled in snakes and roses threaded up his right arm, beginning at his wrist and stopping just at his deltoid. The drone had been anthropomorphized with a screaming face, its eyes squeezed shut as though it were hurling forward at full speed toward its target. His left arm was unmarked. A small woman with a purple visor and gold sunglasses stood beside him, checking the list. She was turning almost everyone away, impatiently repeating herself, “No, no, please leave the line,” to everyone who told her there was a mistake.

I put you on the list, @_Monica23 had written to me. If you can’t get in, just call. I’ll be inside.

I told the woman my name. She paused to check her tablet, scrolling through the names before she looked up. “Sure, go in,” she said, waving me through.

Inside, the air heaved under the sweaty density of bodies jostling toward the coat check, the bar, the dance floor, and the edges of the room, where plastic cushioned seating shielded people against the larger crowd. I headed for the dance floor, back to a DJ booth where Abhor - whom I’d seen at other parties in Chicago - stood encased in a clutch of tranquilized club kids. Monica would be with her, I thought. In the shadows, Abhor seemed like half a machine, her figure cut by an angular red dress with a tremendous, poppy red hood slung back over her shoulders. Her right arm had been tattooed all black. Nothing about her look seemed improvisational, an accident of simply trying things out. Rather, she appeared to have militantly executed every detail, from the way the hood fell onto her back to the loose hairs that stuck out of the black bob that sat on her otherwise shaved head. She centered the room, the axis for a wavering orbit of dancers. She was talking to a boy with his shirt, off, his chest covered with blue paint. I decided against going up to her.

I searched for Monica, but didn’t recognize any faces except Abhor’s. The Shore Club’s few overhead lights crisscrossed the room, briefly catching people as they moved and conjoined together. Except for those few seconds, everyone remained in the dark. The music vibrated the floor and walls the closer I neared the back. No one I passed talked - or screamed - to one another except in the corners, where little groups hovered over bottle service, kissing and leaning in to gossip or flirt or share drugs. The lit tips of electronic cigarettes cut the smoke fog machines had pumped in to the room. It was 3:30am: everything had entered an endless flux that seemed to have exempted me from it, isolating me as though I were present and surrounded, but trapped alone behind glass, a camera scanning a crowd. I looked around, embarrassed that I didn’t really know anyone here. I got in line for a drink at the bar near the back. It was installed under a large metal cross with the wod Shush sculpted in neon red into it.

A girl split the line open and grabbed my arm, pulling me toward her. She wore a black tank top with jeans. “Hey,” she said, her head tilting to the side, “I think you’re looking for me. I’m Monica. Are you waiting for a drink?”

I nodded. “Oh, hi. Yes…”

She glanced at the line and shook her head, playfully annoyed that I’d even thought to come here, to the most crowded bar in the club. “Oh, no, don’t.” She shook her head and held up a drink. “Here - have mine. I just got it. Let’s go in the back. We can sit behind my friend Abhor - there’s a booth.” She stopped. “You look so funny,” she said.

“How so?” I put my hand in my hair and pushed it back. I’d slicked my hair back and worse all black sportswear, like almost everyone else. Did I look weird?

“You look so serious, like you’re not having any fun.”

I made a smile, but I knew it had come off as a grimace. She waved it away. “Don’t worry, you look fine.”

She led me to the back, sliding through the sweaty crowd while I struggled to keep up. When we got to Abhor’s booth she cleared away a few people to make room for us. We sat for thirty minutes, talking mostly about the party in the absence of anything else to say, only touching once on her life when she mentioned she’d just moved into a new building with a pool on the roof, which felt like conversation enough anyways, until even our secluded part of the room swelled with people and we were pushed up against the wall, onto the to pof the couch, where we were wedged in together with some of Monica’s friends. She asked me what I did for a living and I told her I programmed websites but that I’d just left grad school without completing a degree. She asked if I enjoyed programming, and I told her I didn’t, that I wanted to do something else, maybe even leave Chicago for New York. “Ah,” she said, and turned away to say hello to a friend who’d tapped her shoulder.

I watched Abhor from across the room as she smiled and greeted everyone who passed her. She hugged them, kissing each cheek once, but remained otherwise stationary, fixed in place near the DJ. I’d never seen a promoter stand so still as her. “It’s never usually this crowded,” Monica said. “But it’s Thursday, I guess. Maybe let’s leave?”
“Already?”

Parlor - or any of my apps - doesn’t enact a familiarity so quickly as it does a connection between user profiles, an immediate link between clicks of like and dislike, comment and silence, mainlined to a messaging system that condenses language to its minimum: What r u doin rn? U want to hang out? I’m actually never doing anything. It seldom changes. Parlor possesses of itself a sense of displacement that we think we must turn away form, back to real life, but don’t. After thirty minutes I didn’t know if I wanted to go. Outside probably wouldn’t differ so much from the inside. “I’m not sure. Where would we go?”

“Let’s just drive,” Monica said to me. “Can you drive? Or did you cab?” She set down her drink on a ledge. “I can’t.”

“No, I can’t either, but I have a driverless.”

“Oh, amazing! I’ve never been in one, actually. I hear they are so insane.”

“You haven’t? How is that even possible? It’s great,” I said. “Sure, let’s go.”

She jumped up. “Bye,” she said to Abhor. “Have a good night.” Abhor gave her a hug and nodded at me. I gave her a small, awkward wave.

“I’m not lost,” she says to herself, getting up from the table. She refuses to accept the situation of her desires as they play out at dinner, which has been set somewhat clumsily for them by a catering company that the show regularly hires. This is not really life, she thinks, though she also thinks she can’t define “life,” the totality of experiences that constitutes that feeling that things are living, going on, being, herself included, televised, untelevised, the whole telepathic sense of her image as it is distributed throughout the world, whatever “the world” itself might be. Every thought feels stupid. This feels stupid. She reaches over a plate of cauliflower for the wine, but stops, pausing a moment before retracting her hand. She feels like she’s had enough. She decides she should decline the rose (the award the Bachelor bestows on those who are not eliminated, thereby permitting them to move on the the next level) that is hers should he decide to give it to her. She will say goodbye to the other contestants, then ascend the stairs as the camera bobbing above her floats away, its eye refocusing elsewhere on the room, allowing her to pass off screen.

“I’m just trying to keep it real,” The Bachelor says after the show cuts to an interview with him in his bedroom. “I just want to forget everything, the cameras, the show. Keep it real, you know, with the girls. I just want to be sure I’ve selected the right woman. That’s the only thing that matters to me.”

There is no future determined by these coordinates, extrapolated from those bodies flung into it, but this felt most true within the car as it sped toward the dim horizon, wherever that may have been situated in time.

After leaving the Shore Club, we raced through town, or what seemed like town, what could have been Chicago or its suburban outskirts, I couldn’t tell, but once we hit 100 mph I was sure we had left the city’s limits, following the network of highways that intertwined until all become country, the flat geometry of fields and the machines that till them. The shapes of the buildings, houses, and the skyline disintegrated into indefinite shards of light and darkness that collaged into a glowing patchwork until eventually even that broke up and we slipped into a permanent fog broken only by the occasional streaks of other cars that passed us. “I’m not telling you to speed,” Monica shouted, “I’m just telling you I think we could be going faster.” We had been driving for twenty minutes, speeding up at her insistence. She explained she wanted to see what driverless could do under real pressure.

“Come on, faster,” she repeated, looking out the window. I wasn’t sure if she was talking to the car or to me. I wasn’t sure if the difference between the three of us even mattered. I reached out to touch her shoulder, but she pulled back. I felt dizzy, a little sick as the car vibrated under the engine’s stress. It shuddered as though it were beginning to break apart, shedding itself of its plastic shell as we sped forward. She turned up the music.

I directed the car to increase its speed. “Maximum limit reached,” it replied. The dashboard buzzed as the speedometer strobe-lit to indicate that we were going as fast as legally permitted in the state of Illinois. “Any further acceleration would be a violation of Illinois state law, specifically that limit which was set forth by the Illinois state legislature on January 25…” I silenced the car.
“Faster,” Monica shot back.

The fog melted into stark black. We couldn’t see anything but a faint glow out the rear window that I thought must be Chicago. I didn’t want to go back and wondered if it was even there. Forward, everything reversed into beginning: Monica seemed unreal, hallucinated into the car by the car, a reality abridged by fantasy accelerated to the transcendence of the difference between the two. I shouldn’t have let the shore Club. Feelings fade so quickly. We overlapped, sliding onto the pleather seats of the car, slowly becoming gauzy, bodiless subjects bobbing against the ceiling like helium balloons. I tried not to throw up.

Monica turned to me and clapped her hands. “This is what I’m talking about.” I asked her what she was talking about. “The faces at the party,” she said, “circulating in the network, all of them linked together in off-site data storage centers somewhere outside of town, each profile centered in the delay between hi and hi back. Like, hello, this is yours. Just respond.”

“I don’t get it,” I said.

She went to roll down the passenger window. I grabbed her hand. “Don’t. You’ll ruin it.”

She bit her lower lip. In the car, she seemed to have separated herself from herself, and had begun to drift throughout the cabin of the car.

Say nothing of you, us, me, him, her.” She counted off the pronouns on her fingers. “The days are long, evening longer. Without interval. Can we say that? It doesn’t seem a total collapse, does it, even if I have been removed to a car and refuse to declare any place elsewhere it home. I’m not interested in goodbye. To post an update, to update oneself, to post-, as in the crisis of, is to accept these conditions as ours: glycerol in the sand, contradictory iMessages, mesmerized by the approaching headlights. I will not miss any moment in the past or hope to reestablish it in some moment in the past or hope to reestablish it in some future, yours or mine. We know it won’t come but it is sometimes necessary (sometimes a necessary feeling) to assert a moment maybe even a parenthesis of being between things, that will depart from earlier notions of time - and continuity.”

We made eye contact. The imperative remained: “Drive,” she said, “even if you don’t understand me.”

Light streaked the window again. I grew dizzier, split from Monica and the vehicle, lost in various dreams of common space; metropolitan haze at 5am, which might be described as “liquid” or “hydrous,” two words that more or less say the same thing according to my car’s dictionary. Driverless, sunless: urgency well after midnight never changes. We move, even if the precious, but persistent nostalgias of manual over automatic don’t shield us against the machinic impulse to do nothing, and repeat nothing again and again. It only serves to make its hierarchy more obscure. I am in it. She is in it. I turned to Monica to tell her all this but she was looking out the window again, pressing her face to the glass.

I wanted to direct my car to her apartment, which I imagined was in one of the new skyscrapers downtown. The pool she mentioned would be on the roof, in view of the skyline and the few stars that shone through the city light. We would strip off our clothes and jump into the water, despite the cold, swimming about for hours. We wouldn’t do anything, just float, paddling a little with our hands and feet, careful not to break the stillness of the water. The moon would be nearly full.

We made out in the back seat. She put her hand to my face and pinched my cheeks, pushing my face away from hers. “Will it crash?” she asked.

I turned to look out the window. “Of course not,” I said. The entire frame of the car began to shake violently.

The car beeped as the dashboard flashed an alert: “Warning.” “Warning,” it repeated, bringing up the main interface to indicate that the car’s battery had been nearly depleted. The windows of the car suddenly filled with the flashing alarm icon. The car’s battery was less than 5% and falling: “Program will terminate in five seconds,” it said, at which point a second countdown started. At 2%, the car initiated its shutdown. The images of the speeding highway melted into a glitchy collage before the car went dark and the windows returned to the normal view rather than the video feed, opening to the parking lot near the club. The simulation had ended. The air conditioner and speakers stopped.

I moved up to the front of the car and pressed the on button a few times. Nothing. I turned to Monica. “It’s dead for sure.”

“What?” she said. “What happened?” She stared at me, almost in anger.

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t understand. Did the car die? Where are we?”

“We’re...The program died. We’re still at the Shore Club.” I had already explained to her that a driverless can’t go very fast, but it can simulate speed.

She sighed. We’d sobered up. “I see, I see. So it’s almost like a ride.” She ran her hand through her tousled hair. “I see,” she said, again. “I bet watching TV like that is fun.”

“Really fun,” I said. “Especially the new shows, the ones they shoot with multiple cameras. It’s almost like you’re there.”

“It felt really real.”

“Yeah, That happens to a lot of people when try it for the first time. The simulation goes long enough that it just feels like real life, and you kind of slip into it.”

She nodded, a bit unconvinced. The first time I’d tried it I felt the same way. I’d used the program to imagine driving through the desert at night at 135mph. When the car’s feed ended to reveal my driveway in Chicago I felt like a dream had just begun, the real a dull simulation of my other life.

“Will you get home?” she asked.

“I can call a cab,” I said, “and just...I don’t know, have it charged in the morning. You?”

“Oh, I’m fine.” She opened the passenger door to exist and got out, shakily at first, sticking her head back in to grin at me. “Ok, sure. Have a good night,” she said. “Text me tomorrow?”

The Bachelor enters the pool alone. He sticks his index finger in the water to test the temperature. Though it’s chillier than he’d hoped, he decided it’s warm enough and leaps in to find that it isn’t so cold after all, actually, but rather warm, as warm as any body, and so he stays down and holds his breath, taking the moment to break from the competition and the cameras. He can go for thirty seconds before he has to come up. He tries again, this time reaching thirty-three seconds. He surfaces again, takes in a mouthful of air, and dives down, swimming to the bottom of the deep end where he paddles to keep himself close to the pool’s floor. He counts forty seconds, then pushes himself to forty-five before coming up once more. He throws his head back and looks around him, wiping the water from his eyes: the contestants have left the house and are gathered around to watch him, clapping and calling for him to join them for drinks on the veranda. “Come out of the pool,” one of the women yells. A few laugh and coo at him. He lowers his head and sucks in a mouthful of water. “Come out!” another possible wife says. He says nothing and the women fall silent for a moment. They wait for him to answer them. Finally, he spits out a jet of water at her. Everyone begins to scream with laughter. He laps the pool, splashing the women as some of them leap in and others step back to get out of the way. A few of the possible wives fall back onto the wet grass, laughing as their glasses of wine spill out to the ground. The camera crew rushes out of the house to capture them.Embed"

Maaan. The Aries doesn't know how to be fake, they are very into their own ways. An Aries doesn't copy people; no matter what the fashion trends are, the Aries dress how they want. The type of person who you can have around three completely different types of people and they will act exactly the same. Not good with finding women, the Aries is very straightforward and this can mess up their fating techniques. The Aries isn't the best guy for a drunken two-man, if the girls are drunk babbling, being stupid, he doesn't put up with it on order to have sex with them later - calls them out on their stupidity.

Taurus
The best mothers. A Taurus is extremely selfless, the Taurus loves to focus on others. I know a Taurus who has a job, where she is the boss of everyone, when others are lazy she does their job for them while still handling her own duties and doesn't even say anything about it. A Taurus would rather see you, - you as in the people they love -  be happy than themselves  be happy. The Taurus loves to listen to gossip, watch moves and listen to music about other people. People fascinate the Taurus. They are extremely passionate about whatever it is they stand for. A Taurus' opinion on something can never be changed, they don't loose arguments, you just have to give up. Very silly; they think simple things are funny. Not a drama-starter for others but for themselves they love it. If the Taurus doesn't have someone hating on them or somebody to prove wrong they get bored.

Gemini
A brick wall, great at hiding emotions. The girl I like is a Gemini. I couldn't tell if she liked me back I had to straight up ask. When it comes to love, they have to be safe, they won't put their feelings  out into the world to be rejected or something. They hate BS, if you're in a life-or-death situation with a Gemini they are going to hold it together 100 per cent. Born smart, they look at situations and can access the feelings of both parties involved. If you need someone to manage your life pick a Gemini. They are going to ride for you, every single one of these May babies are very hilarious: Dean Martin was a Gemini.

Cancer
The sensitive one. The Cancer takes family and friends very seriously and makes sure others are doing OK before they are doing OK. Will give a bum his last dollar type of guy. The Cancer gets so lucky all the time; because of their endless selflessness they have great karma. I know a man who walked onto a film set to be a boxing instructor for an actor. He was so charming though, and was fresh out the penitentiary, that the director chose him to act instead of the professional actor! The luck of the Cancer is insane. Constantly, they are wondering how you're doing, if everything is ok with you - they suck at talking about themselves. Annoying lovers, ha. The love so much it can be overwhelming, but the non-cancers see that, they can't help it, the love blossoms and grows. Great assistants or bodyguards. Cancer is great at taking orders.

Leo
Leos only know extremes. Leos are normally great friends to others. The 'take a bullet' type of friend - and not in a 'I would take a bullet for you' type of way. If someone was shooting a gun in the party the Leo would find you and make himself a human shield. I personally know a Leo who works for a company, the boss of that company made a comment about the Leo's friends tie in the office in confidence to the Leo. Every in the office sucks up to the boss but this Leo looks at his boss and says ""Hey, that's not funny."" To his boss! Leo's don't care who you are or what it means if your relationship goes sour; if you don't keep it real the Leo has no respect for you. The Leo loves confrontation, any chance at a problem and he'll take it. The Leo is the most passionate lover and coldest at the same time. Leos love to think: think more, feel less is their motto. A Leo will think himself into another dimension of himself he created while thinking so damn hard, ha.

Virgo
Virgos are always a little bit lazy. Great working bees, give them a task and it will be completed to a tee, but try and get them to push their own campaign or task? Forget about it. Always filled with useful information, love to study; maybe not necessarily school but they study something. If a Virgo loves music, they spend Friday nights listening to records. Ridiculously personable, very easy to bring around new friends, Virgos make their presence know but it's not overbearing when they stand in a circle and speak. Virgos are observant; can make a lot of on-point observations about someone's personality after only a few minutes of hanging out. A Virgo would be the best interviewer for a job.

Libra
They're all about longevity. The Libra is the type to always be waiting, hopeful, always have some project or something coming next. There's a libra in my friend group who's mom died (Kevin White - let's stop beating around the bush) and he handled it very well. He had to move out of his house he grew up in; he had to abruptly become an adult with no fallback plans but he did it promptly and precisely and wasted no time in making it happen for himself. He's got his own apartment, a car, and still has time to skate and model. Libras are insanely level headed and logical. Even when they do things that seem crazy, the explanation makes it make sense every time. Great lovers, always in or about to be in a relationship. The Libra deals with emotion very well, nothing overwhelms the Libra. Problems are dealt with poignantly. Libras are always the sense of security in a friendship group. Libras and Leos know how to fight; fight physically and mentally.

Scorpio
Every Scorpio is blindly, no-practice-needed, amazingly talented at something. Kevin Bradley will not skate for 3 months, hop back on his board roll around for 5 minutes and look like he never took a break, he's a real Scorpio, ha. They are always the spokesman for cool in their friend group. The Scorpio loves to act, not think. They make decisions at the drop of a hat, when they pass a window of a store with something they like it's in their last possession 4 minutes later. Scorpios focus on themselves, not in a self-centered way, more in a 'it'll be more fun to hang around me if I'm happy' type of way, ha. The Scorpio is not a reliable person. Their lack of thinking about decisions causes their decision making to be very abrupt, so if they say they are coming somewhere and in the last second hey get a feeling to not go, the don't go. Simple as that, ha. Don't call a Scorpio if you're dying on the streets.

Sagittarius
The Sagittarius doesn't move fast, ever Sagittarius is very calming and almost boring to some people. They are very confident and smart with money. They have a knack for wooing women, they're calm and their sternness reminds women of their father they either had - or never had. The Sagittarius lets his spirit speak for him not his clothes or car. They need nothing to show they are wealthy cause they don't care for you to know they are wealthy. The Sagittarius will have a really nice car and just laugh and quietly say thanks if you end up seeing it after work. They will never make it their priority to let you know something like that. Extremely ambitious, the Sagittarius will work until he's dead.  Their confidence causes them to always be true to themselves. They will never do something solely because someone thinks it's a good idea, if they don't feel it, they don't do it.
Capricorn
A born leader. When Capricorns are little kids their influence is so strong that grown men may look at them for mannerisms and style to copy.  Capricorns are always calm and quietly confident, the kind of confidence that doesn't need to speak. Capricorns are awkward lovers. The confidence and need to swag makes it hard to let others in. I know a Capricorn who dresses crazy, if you lay his outfits on a bed they look horrible. But when he wears them it's a completely different story.

Aquarius
Very low-key, this paragraph was hard to write because everyone I know who is an Aquarius doesn't like to tell you when it's their birthday, ha. The Aquarius is a slave to routine; they love doing the same thing everyday. They would rather practice something and become very good at it rather than having a bunch of halfway developed different talents. They like to keep their friend group small. When the Aquarius meets new people it takes them a while to start talking about siblings or old stories. Great listeners. If you do a crime, bring an Aquarius, they will never snitch on you 100 per cent. In middle school a kid and I got in an argument over a game of kickball before it could even get physical my buddy Cameron comes out of nowhere and throws a kickball in the other kid's face, directly after the bell rings, we give each other a look, then go inside. Nobody said a word to any teachers, Cameron and victims were both Aquarius.


Pisces
The most secretively sensitive person you've ever met! The Pisces will have a million and one problems with someone/something but would rather just mentally check them off the list than talk it out. The Pisces is sensitive in a 'fuck you' type of way, not a 'get sad and cry' type of way. Because of constantly avoiding conflict the Pisces is usually a great spirit. Halfway thinkers, they don't think too much like Leos, but aren't like the Scorpio: the Scorpio just goes, never thinks but that's another story, ha. These February/March babies have a great talent of giving hope and inspiring others to do something great. Imagine this person, Johnny. Johnny gets double-crossed on a construction job where he is promised the contract by Friend (Friend is the opposing made-up character). When Friend gives another construction company the job, instead of getting mad and arguing, Johnny goes and works hard, ends up getting 10 jobs that were better than the first one and makes a lot of money. Johnny and Friend bump into each other at a party in the town center, Friend says, ""Johnny how have you been?"" Jonny says: ""I've been very successful lately."" And Johnny and Friend never have the same relationship but always remain friendly. Ha, that is a Pisces.Embed"

Opel Speedster / Vauxhall VS220
Basically a Lotus Elise, but people didn't know, also it's an Opel which didn't help sales at all.

2. Toyota Matrix
A sporty model of the Corolla looking thing? Yeah, okay.

3. Volkswagen Golf GTI (ALL OF THEM)
GOLFS ARE THE DEVIL, AS WELL AS THE KIDS THAT DRIVE THEM. I GET MAD JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM.

4. Nissan S13 240SX
Overused, not that good, overhyped, ugly. Drift missile bro…

5. Opel/Vauxhall Corsa
Even if the latest models aren't really BAD cars, they still remain Opel Corsas. Why pay for a Corsa when you can get a nicer looking hatchback for the same amount of money??

6. Subaru Impreza WRX
Much like the Golf and the S13, overhyped and not very good looking. Most owners are idiots and they wish they had an STI.

7. Chevrolet Spark
Americans don't need fuel efficient city cars and Europe has too many better ones, what's the point of this thing I don't get it, can someone explain it to me?

8. Honda Accord Coupe (US Version)
A Honda for the 70 year old American retiree, I personally don't really hate it because it has a 3.5L V6 but yeah, Americans tell me these cars don't really get a lot of love over there.

9. Mercedes-Benz CLK200/220/whatever
HAHA… NICE WHIP BRO, I SEE YOU CAME TO DAT MONEY WITH THAT THIRD HAND CLK220 FROM THE EARLY 2000S! YEAH BRO, DAT BENZO… YOU FINALLY MADE IT.
10. Porsche 911 4WD Convertible (ALL OF THEM)
You buy a Porsche for the road feel, the engagement of a bare bone sportscar, not to try to impress your secretary in a automatic 4000 lb convertible. Get an SL instead. DAMN.

11. Honda Integra Type R DC2
The DC2 is my favorite of the Integras and my favorite FWD Honda, I don't like the round headlights front version, I think that's pretty ugly, but I love the rectangular headlight version, also it's pretty damn capable.

12. Nissan Sunny/Pulsar GTI-R
This thing is crazy, the base model is basically just your average Japanese affordable hatchback, but the GTI-R has four wheel drive from the freaking Skyline GTRs and a 227HP SR20 turbocharged 4 cylinder that's also found on the Silvias and something else I'm not JDM enough to know about.

13. Toyota Corolla AE86
I don't know the exact name but I'm sure you know what I mean, I kinda prefer the Levin over the Trueno, but most people prefer the Trueno because of them pop out headlights. I like it because it's kinda the iconic cheap RWD lightweight hatchback that everyone likes, not much of a looker and a performer when stock, but can look absolutely crazy when you mess around with it. They sold them in the US but here they were sold in France and Ireland only I believe? Whatever, they're just super rare everywhere because they exported a tiny amount but all the Japanese collectors brought them back to Japan LOL.

14. Lancia Delta Integrale Evo 2
Started life as a pretty average FWD cheap hatchback, the last evolution was the exact same car that won the WRC 6 times in a row, and looks extremely cool with its widened stance and alcantara interiors. These things are becoming so expensive it's unbelievable.

15. Mercedes-Benz 190E Evo 2
Homologation model for DTM or touring car racing (too lazy to check, it's probably DTM) looks mean, has tartan seats, a 2.5L 4 cylinder that makes 250HP N/A (!!!) and has a giant spoiler in the back. Also funny thing about that, the requirements for homologations stated that the rear spoiler couldn't block the view from the rear view mirror inside the car, so what Mercedes did was basically just add a piece of black plastic at the top of the rear glass and voila.

16. Renault Clio Williams
The Clio is a pretty popular cheap hatchback in Europe, and the Williams version wasn't much more expensive, but was a whole lot faster, had a N/A 140HP 1.6L 4 cylinder, and it looked cool as hell cause it only came in dark blue (as far as I know) and gold wheels.

17. Nissan Skyline GTR R32
The resurrection of the GTR after about 30 years. Pretty big coupe, not sure if ""compact"" but it probably is for American standards. The engine is limited to 280HP due to some agreement all the Japanese car makers agreed to during the 90s or whatever. That was where cars couldn't make more power than 280HP, which was kinda pointless since they were all limited to just 180 km/h (about 112 mph) but everyone knows the RB26 can make literally any amount of power you want.

18. Subaru SVX
The SVX is a cool car that didn't sell much because it was basically a premium Subaru and in the US, during that time, Subaru only sold cheap econoboxes so nobody bought it because they couldn't trust a ""cheap car maker"" to make a luxury car. It was fairly expensive at the time and it had a cool 3.3L 6 cylinder boxer engine and all kinds of crazy stuff in it. And it looks great.
19. Toyota Soarer GZ20
Not much I can say about this one other than the fact that it has that cool Japanese 90s design and it comes with a bunch of engines including a 3.0L straight six.

20. Alfa Romeo GTV6 - RWD 2.5L V6 Coupe
That it's basically the most common Alfa Romeo in the US along with the Spider, I think it looks beautiful, styled by ItalDesign. Callaway made a twin turbo version too. Alfa Romeo is LIFE.Embed"

These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes, but the real ones
Just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick, I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papá
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' 'bout somethin'
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body-jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came witcha
But he ain't witcha
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades

I may be younger, but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here, I'll save some for you
I'm not him, but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

[Bridge]
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?

[Verse 1]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the rooves
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Outro: Frank Ocean & Beyoncé]
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out of melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet

Many college students have gone to college and gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else, don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana, because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, byeYou might also like40Embed"

Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing
By myself, gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you
Gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now, I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (Solo), solo (Solo)
S-solo (Solo), s-solo (Solo)

It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire

Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw, though
Now your baby mama ain't so vicious

And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo, yeah
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died
Smoking big, rolling solo

Keep alive, stay alive

Making sweet love, takin' time

That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the 5

Pretty fuckin', underneath moonlight now
Pretty fuckin', sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur, hey)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, haze, wait)

Wanna film a tape on a speed boat?
We smell of Californication (Strike a pose)
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows (Ooh)
Can you come when I call again?

On comes the evening, gold seeking ends

[Verse 1]
'Round your city, 'round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, nani-nani
This feel like a Quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body, ah

New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
Every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na-na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

[Bridge]
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right
[Part II]
[Verse 2]
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my twenty-eighth up (Fire)
1998, my family had that Acura (Fire)
Oh, the Legend (Fire)
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active (Massive)
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions (Massive)
All the reverends
Preachin' self-made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na-na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
Every day shit, every day shit
Every night shit, every day shit
Every day shit, every day shit

So low that I don't get high no more

So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling, this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
Don't pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie, but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment

No, I was just telling that I, I got this, this girl before
And I was together since three years
And uh, I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and, uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it, because I was, like, in front of her
In front of her, and she told me, like, ""Accept me on Facebook""
It was virtual, means no sense
So I say, ""I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook""
She starting to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her, she thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, ""It's, it's over, I can't believe you""
I said, ""Come on, you're crazy, because like, yeah
I'm in front of you, I'm every day, here in your house""

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

[Verse 2]
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

[Verse 3]
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life (Life), in this life (Life)
One too many years

Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time

Call my mama like, ""Mama

To stand on my feet, mama

They paying me, mama
I should be paying them""
I should be paying y'all, honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was, I don't know which heaven would have me, mama
Let me run this bitch, I'ma run it into the ground, mama, the whole galaxy

Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now (Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke somethin'

I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga, murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cuff bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my photo
I only got one four-door
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song, so I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas wan' fight in the streets
Now shit startin' to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog, this is chess now, not fetch, I ain't runnin' for a nigga
Ain't ran since track meets, that's the only time I ran from a nigga
You can change this track now, could've changed this bitch a long time ago

Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th, though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
Shit went one-eighty on me, please run that back, though

You say some shit about me? Tuck a real sport, my nigga
That shit happened the second time? 'Cause Mark saw both times, nigga, I only saw the first time
That second time, Jerron was there, nigga
On God, he grabbed me in circles, nigga
And the, and the other nigga tried to pull me
Oh yeah, Jerron told me you that your ass especially told him
Yeah, 'cause the nigga tried to boom me in my face
I had AD in a headlock, nigga (The first time I saw?), I had this nigga like—

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

[Chorus]
But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Verse 2]
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

Yup, duplex in New Orleans East
I was writin' down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleepin' on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stingin' me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower
My aunt-in-law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wifebeater
Bare feet and bra-less, titties swingin'
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok Classic's
Weaves and baskets
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Max's
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost your virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feelin' unnatural

[Refrain: Frank Ocean]
This what I would do just to show you that it's special now
What could I do to know you better than I do now?
What can I do to love you more than I do now?

[Verse 1]
My head fatiguing off the opus
Kept it underground to focus
I feel afterlife, six under oath, don't want no hocus-pocus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact, rip my facemask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net, is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Perusing the MoMA, I'm on all my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman? Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seemed like time's up
When we swerved in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time
I mean, time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved your crew
Like niggas came through with the Groupons
Cookin' with the grease now, truffle fries and Cholula
Are you slowin' down?
Are you holdin' down whoever held you down?
Whoever propped you up, built the structures with you
Swished the buckets with ya, who was fuckin' with ya?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you see 'em now is it forced black?
Hail Mary on the fourth down

Over where the trees burn down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
All tonight, I'll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we danced this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (When I was young)
See me wither (When I was young)

There's something you need someone out there
But try to love the one you're with tonight

Tonight late at night sometimes it helps
If you don't have to be all by yourself
In a moment life could end
And this could all be over with
I know you're in here somewhere
You came out alone
Something you need

Sometime in heaven
You still behind like ancestor
All on your mood board all year

You ain't got no muscles, lil' nigga
I ain't in the mood for it all year
I keep the cheats on always
Wrong side of average

You slide off or peace out, yeah, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, ooh, yeah, yeah

For your mentality
You play ball, you run five-on-five least three times a week
Glen Park down the street
Waitin' on you to tire, retire with victory
Play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose, you don't cry, but you low-key sad to see
If we cut like some champions, you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-aah-uh, smiling
I'm still working while you dream, pop
I could never let a scene stop, smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point, pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi, tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day runnin' numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall
They're like, ""Something's gotta give""
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets, you can't see the sky, I'm out here

Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self-contained and aware
Of each other's forms still and in full strides
Just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

[Refrain]
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you 'round the Higgs

[Verse 2]
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video; only difference is flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you showed
What you give, my words can't hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]

The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life

Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life

The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off

Stop thinking of this as being money
""It's just money, I'ma make more""
No, no, no-no-no-no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now, it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay
But that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They have taken Cleopatra

[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra)
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cleopatra)
[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
[Part II]

[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, that's right

Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch Westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me, ooh
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Live in the clouds
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Life in the clouds
Keep em high, y'all
Beautiful stars
In the sky

[Verse 2]
Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma, oh
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away

You mean so much to me
In my world, my world

[Verse 3]
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still, in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us ‘til the end

[Outro]
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh

And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, ""What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?""
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure

(Hey, hey)
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, ""Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job""
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice

So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl, I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]

The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either

Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill

Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free

Stop thinking of this as being money

No, no, no-no-no-no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money

It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now, it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay

Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

She's working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, that's right
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah

Double D, big full breasts on my baby

Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work?
Boss ain't workin' you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on you, girl
(Too weird to live and too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever, have I ever let you get caught? (Oh)

Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch Westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me, ooh
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Live in the clouds
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Life in the clouds
Keep em high, y'all
Beautiful stars
In the sky

[Verse 2]
Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma, oh
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away

You mean so much to me

[Verse 3]
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still, in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us ‘til the end

[Outro]

Wave 'em high now, to the sky

And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, ""What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?""
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

(Hey, hey)
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, ""Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job""
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands
[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey

We handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious
Then
I'm still kicking
I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
All the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear
I've loved
I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell
To the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, oh
Even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved
I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times here

I think I started something
I got what I wanted, did-didn't I?
Can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z-Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice-cold lawn
She handed me a ice-blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley

Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
But it keeps on moving

Stripper booty with a rack like wow, how-how
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feeling I never had
Never had, never had (Never)
And ever since, I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you

I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose, but baby, don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman, but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

[Chorus]
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try
You and I try, try
We all try

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something, oh, oh

Haha
When I was younger, I used to wonder, like...

[Verse 1]
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, ""Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun""

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

[Chorus]
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Shit, oh well, oh well,"" ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me...""

Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me

[Chorus]
Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Okay, I don't believe it""
I say ""Nope, I swear, I never do it""
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend""
[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah
(Ooh, ooh, ah) Ooh, ah

[Bridge]
Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half

I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done

This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway
It's love made in the USA

Don't let 'em front you, they sayin' you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be trippin' over some bitch-ass dude

Oh, oh, oh, oh
They have taken Cleopatra

[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra)
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cleopatra)
[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
[Part II]

[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free

The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach

The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave

Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My soul glow with the low cut, no jheri curl, Jerry Rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, won't think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin' me
Swearing he's grown when he got that steel
But he ain't swam with that blue whale
I ain't swam with that ho neither, Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water, hope the monster don't wag his tail
And send that big wave over while I'm showin' off my pirate grill
To the baddies walkin' by me, showin' skin because it's nothing
My little brother servin' molly 'cause that bill due Monday
And my passport's buried and my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water, but my shoes still muddy
And if I ever have a daughter, I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach, I guess I call her Karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat, I'm kiddin' but I'm ballin'
Just playin' but I'm serious, I'm witted and I'm wildin'

[Chorus]
This life goes on, man, that's one thing about it
This life goes on, dawg, that's one thing about it
I'm feelin' what you're sayin', you're tryin' to get around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it

Yeah she did, that you can date outside your race, I mean
I ain't supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case, I mean
Somebody please switch my plates, ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels, still ain't ridin' chrome
Backpack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let irrelevant nigga do what irrelevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge
Because his gavel fake and he regular, still
How that gravel taste? How you paid your medical bill?
Sands white on my tan feet, Colosseum in the back seat

Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows

Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' the same

[Refrain]
Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world you'll see
What I see, who I become
What I see, who I become
We're all chasin' after our ends
Chasin' after our ends
