Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me dead
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
Even aftеr all, it'd still wreck me
To find out you know how to forget mе
Even after all this time

Know you can't stand my face

But not the thought of you moving on

I miss knowing what you're thinking
And hearing how your day has been
Do you think you could tell me everything, darling?
But leave out every part about him
Right now, you're probably by the ocean
While I'm still out here in the rain
With every day that passes by since we've spoken
It's like Glasgow gets farther from LA

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's supposed to be this way

[Chorus]
But, oh, my love
I wanna say, ""I miss the green in your eyes""
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, ""Without you, everything's wrong""
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best

[Verse 2]
Well, I can't help but notice
You seem happier than ever now
And I guess that I should tell you I'm sorry
It seems I was the problem somehow

I bring her coffee in the mornin'
She brings me inner peace
I take her out to fancy restaurants
She takes the sadness out of me
I make her cards on her birthday
She makes me a better man
I take her water when she's thirsty
She takes me as I am

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when her mind wanders
And she loves it when I stay at home
I know when she's lost
And she knows when I feel alone

[Chorus]
From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everything is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everything is pointless without you

[Verse 2]
I light the fire when it's cold out
And she lights up the room
I hope that she'll love me forever
She hopes I'll be back soon
I take her out to the movies
She takes away my pain
She is the start of everything
And I'll be there 'til the end

When I'm with you, it's like nothing else
Like I could run and tell the Devil to go fuck himself

Oh, Lord, I ain't afraid to die if it means I'm by your side
It would be such a heavenly way to say goodbye
From now, until the afterlife
Be it rain, or hail, or shine
We could be intertwined

Whether you were heaven-sent to save mе from above
Or the only one who doеsn't hate me, that's enough
Well I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus only angels can sing
Now I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

If we don't work it out, that's something I could accept

You were the raging storm that wrecked
A beautiful mind I can't forget
Knew from the moment that we met I'd take you home
But, now that the future's so unclear
Have all of your feelings disappeared?
'Cause I'm in no kind of frame of mind to let you go

Hope, have you some that I can borrow?
'Cause I've been so low
And the weight of all the world's a heavy load
Keep me going till tomorrow
'Cause I just don't know if I can face another day alone

[Chorus]
Well, my lungs don't breathe
And my heart don't beat
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
No, I just don't want any kind of life without you, dear

[Verse 2]
Are there any words that I could say?
I'm feeling our moment fade away
In a matter of hours, we'll be drowning in the waves
And, all of the memories that we shaped
We're leaving behind, here in my wake
If we can save the good we gave, we shouldn't wait

If I can face another day alone

[Chorus]
Well, my lungs don't breathe
And my heart don't beat
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
No, I just don't want any kind of life without you, dear

[Outro]
Now you're not here, I can't explain
The carousel of my constant pain
I'm not sure that I can hold on anymore
Became a victim of circumstance
Should've said when I had the chance
I don't want any kind of life without you here

I will be your shoulder to cry on

Yeah, I'll be anybody but me

[Pre-Chorus]
To tell you the truth, I'm a mess, I'm a fool
You don't know that
And you never will
In my mind, it's instilled not to show that

I spend almost all of my time
Feeling like I'm falling even further behind
And I know I'm so good at seeming
Like I'm not on the edge of a knife
I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya?
Designed to deceive
So, tell me who you want me to be

'Cause I don't like the one underneath
Always found it easy to fake it

Two heartbeats, never in time
Two lovers over enemy lines

You're so close to saying the words
Way past the point of any return
It's such a shame and I don't wanna believe it

Oh, if I could go back to that evening we met
Trembling hands as I'd ask for your number again
You saw me different then
Oh, when I held your heart in my hand

So, if you're gonna leave me
Just leave me slowly
Let's make it last
Just one more dance
Before the moment's passed
I'd rather that you lay here
Than leave me lonely

You said, ""Who are we fooling?""
I guess that you gave up
On all that I am and all that I'm not
'Cause I'm fucking useless and full of excuses
I guess that you cut free
From all that we are and will never be

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the flowers are dead like the hearts in our chest
And I'm hanging my head 'cause I'm tryna forget
How we bled, and we bled, and we bled, and we bled

[Chorus]
So, this is where we ended up
All of those years that I wasted for lovе
And here it is, forevеrmore
The house is on fire and I can't find the door
If I had the heart to start it again
I'd stamp out the sparks in my own self-defence
Say, you ain't gonna like how this ends

You know, if we went back
To fix what we once had
There'd still be no chance
For you and me 'cause inevitably

Suppose I thought that, by this moment, I would have it figured out
But, instead, I tend to spend my days consumed by seeds of doubt
I know I can

Always, forever, 'til I'm barely holdin' on
End of my tether and I know it won't be long
It won't be long 'til it's gone

That seems to leave me so unsatisfied
No sense of self, but self-obsessed

We were strangers at the bar
They were playing ""Wonderwall""
I overheard you say you hate this song
Next thing I knew, I'm walkin' over
Came and tapped you on your shoulder
Said, ""My dear, you're not the only one""
Spent the night there at my place
That night became a hundred days
And I shared all my deepest secrets with you
Soon enough, well, I found out you're something I can't live without
And, every time I close my eyes, I miss you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know
I waited all my life just to fall for someone like you
In the blink of an eye, yeah, it all fell through

I can't even lie, I'm not doing well
Waking up without you, sleeping by myself
Alone in our room, all your stuff is gone
Yeah, I'm standing still here while you're moving on
When my world would tear in two, you were who I ran to
Now I can't even call, or call you my friend

Waking up too early, static on the TV
Dressed in all the clothes I had on
When yesterday decided I didn't need to fight with
The hours and the seconds no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Doing all the things that I'm supposed to
Working every day the way that most do
Smiling while I'm hiding what I'm going through
But you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
That, if I'm being honest
I couldn't tell you this is all I wanted
I struggle sleeping 'cause the house feels haunted
Filled with the shadows of regret and the things I should've said
To the ones I laid to rest, and, lately
I'm terrified that all my youth is fading
Man, growing old is so excruciating
Is there a cure for minds unwell? 'Cause my head's a living hell
If I'm honest with myself

And I regret to say, politely, I'm the guy who'll more than likely lose
Like I always do

[Chorus]
So, tell me, are you running scared
'Cause you know that I'm beyond repair?
Well, baby, I'm a master of the ancient art of always fucking up
Everything I've ever loved
'Cause I wrote the book, the study of the ancient art of always fucking up

[Verse 2]
May I have your attention please?
Step right up and see the most amazing
The absolutely mind-inflaming show
About a boy who sold his soul
For a shot at love and gold
And he almost made it but lost it on the way, the story goes

'Cause you know that I'm beyond repair?
Well, baby, I'm a master of the ancient art of always fucking up
Everything I've ever loved
They fall from me like autumn leaves
The wake, I make it scattered with debris
Of everything that could have been
'Cause I wrote the book, the study of the ancient art of always fucking up

[Bridge]
And I'm plagued by design
Forget all my lines
I've burned all my blessings more than half the time
Been trapped in my ways
But I'm desperate to change
So, let me know if you'll stay

[Chorus]
So, tell me, are you running scared
'Cause you know that I'm beyond repair?
Well, baby, I'm a master of the ancient art of always fucking up

Cut my teeth on memories from playgrounds to the bars
There's bigger boys with broken hearts who throw their weight around
But settle down, and be here now, just watch the world revolve
Don't it feel so good to be so small?

[Verse 2]
Cast my mind behind and think of girls I used to know
Who've all moved on to better things and found the ones they love
But it don't breed animosity, I'm not perturbed at all
Oh, man, it feels so good to feel so small

[Chorus]
Well, it's sad but sometimes it's true
That your friends become the people you knew
Once upon a time, that you left behind
Old navy blue

[Verse 3]
No matter though, how good things go, they've always got to end
I've said goodbye to family from the side of their sick beds
So, to all the ones I'll always love but faded out of view
Until we meet again, this one's for you

[Chorus]
Well, it's sad but sometimes it's true
That your friends become the people you knew
Once upon a time, that you left behind

I miss knowing what you're thinking
And hearing how your day has been
Do you think you could tell me everything, darling?

Right now, you're probably by the ocean
While I'm still out here in the rain
With every day that passes by since we've spoken
It's like Glasgow gets farther from LA

But, oh, my love
I wanna say, ""I miss the green in your eyes""
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, ""Without you, everything's wrong""
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best

I bring her coffee in the mornin'
She brings me inner peace
I take her out to fancy restaurants
She takes the sadness out of me
I make her cards on her birthday
She makes me a better man
I take her water when she's thirsty
She takes me as I am

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when her mind wanders
And she loves it when I stay at home
I know when she's lost
And she knows when I feel alone

[Chorus]
From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everything is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everything is pointless without you

[Verse 2]
I light the fire when it's cold out
And she lights up the room
I hope that she'll love me forever
She hopes I'll be back soon
I take her out to the movies
She takes away my pain
She is the start of everything
And I'll be there 'til the end

We could put this to bed for good

You were the raging storm that wrecked
A beautiful mind I can't forget
Knew from the moment that we met I'd take you home
But, now that the future's so unclear
Have all of your feelings disappeared?
'Cause I'm in no kind of frame of mind to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Hope, have you some that I can borrow?
'Cause I've been so low
And the weight of all the world's a heavy load
Keep me going till tomorrow
'Cause I just don't know if I can face another day alone

[Chorus]
Well, my lungs don't breathe
And my heart don't beat
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
No, I just don't want any kind of life without you, dear

[Verse 2]
Are there any words that I could say?
I'm feeling our moment fade away
In a matter of hours, we'll be drowning in the waves
And, all of the memories that we shaped
We're leaving behind, here in my wake
If we can save the good we gave, we shouldn't wait

Hope, have you some that I can borrow?
'Cause I just don't know

And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
No, I just don't want any kind of life without you, dear

[Outro]
Now you're not here, I can't explain
The carousel of my constant pain
I'm not sure that I can hold on anymore
Became a victim of circumstance
Should've said when I had the chance
I don't want any kind of life without you here

To tell you the truth, I'm a mess, I'm a fool
You don't know that

I spend almost all of my time
Feeling like I'm falling even further behind

I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya?
Designed to deceive

Always found it easy to fake it

Two heartbeats, never in time
Two lovers over enemy lines
I know we're broken but don't wanna believe it

[Verse 2]
You're so close to saying the words
Way past the point of any return
It's such a shame and I don't wanna believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if I could go back to that evening we met
Trembling hands as I'd ask for your number again
You saw me different then
Oh, when I held your heart in my hand

[Chorus]
So, if you're gonna leave me
Just leave me slowly
Let's make it last
Just one more dance
Before the moment's passed
I'd rather that you lay here
Than leave me lonely
So, stay for a while
Just one more mile
Before we say goodbye

You said, ""Who are we fooling?""
I guess that you gave up
On all that I am and all that I'm not
'Cause I'm fucking useless and full of excuses
I guess that you cut free
From all that we are and will never be

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the flowers are dead like the hearts in our chest
And I'm hanging my head 'cause I'm tryna forget
How we bled, and we bled, and we bled, and we bled

[Chorus]
So, this is where we ended up
All of those years that I wasted for lovе
And here it is, forevеrmore
The house is on fire and I can't find the door
If I had the heart to start it again
I'd stamp out the sparks in my own self-defence
Say, you ain't gonna like how this ends

[Verse 2]
You know, if we went back
To fix what we once had
There'd still be no chance
For you and me 'cause inevitably

Would come as no surprise as I tried to forget

All of those years that I wasted for love
And here it is, forevermore
The house is on fire and I can't find the door

No, you ain't gonna like how this ends

Broken with no way to mend
No, you ain't gonna like how this ends
I'm stuck here just tryna forget

Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me dead
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
Even aftеr all, it'd still wreck me
To find out you know how to forget mе
Even after all this time

Days ache and nights are grey
My heart is still your place, babe
Guess I still feel the same
Know you can't stand my face
Some scars you can't erase, babe
Guess you still feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me

Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I

I'm not ready to let you forget me, to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh
I'm not ready to let you forget me, to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh (Even after all this time)

I miss knowing what you're thinking
And hearing how your day has been
Do you think you could tell me everything, darling?
But leave out every part about him
Right now, you're probably by the ocean
While I'm still out here in the rain
With every day that passes by since we've spoken
It's like Glasgow gets farther from LA

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's supposed to be this way

[Chorus]
But, oh, my love
I wanna say, ""I miss the green in your eyes""
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, ""Without you, everything's wrong""
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best

[Verse 2]
Well, I can't help but notice
You seem happier than ever now
And I guess that I should tell you I'm sorry
It seems I was the problem somehow

I bring her coffee in the mornin'
She brings me inner peace
I take her out to fancy restaurants
She takes the sadness out of me
I make her cards on her birthday
She makes me a better man
I take her water when she's thirsty
She takes me as I am

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when her mind wanders
And she loves it when I stay at home
I know when she's lost
And she knows when I feel alone

[Chorus]
From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everything is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everything is pointless without you

[Verse 2]
I light the fire when it's cold out
And she lights up the room
I hope that she'll love me forever
She hopes I'll be back soon
I take her out to the movies
She takes away my pain
She is the start of everything
And I'll be there 'til the end

From now, until the afterlife
Be it rain, or hail, or shine

Whether you were heaven-sent to save mе from above
Or the only one who doеsn't hate me, that's enough
Well I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus only angels can sing
Now I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

Don't put your cover up, you know it's bad for your health
And when the going's tough, you're way too hard on yourself
I wish you'd open up, and I'd lend a little to help
Before you dive off the deep end

Will you hold me? like you want me?
But you don't give me nothin' else
Feel this happening, but you feel absent
Can you tell me what it is?

And she said this
""Haven't you ever been in love before?
You heard 'em say, it takes the pain away
And it's a feelin' that you can't ignore""
""But it's more like a knife to me than a high to mе
And my heart can't fall apart anymore
If you knew what I, knеw you'd be terrified
Haven't you ever been in love before?""

If we don't work it out, that's something I could accept
But I feel you're ruling out, a love that ain't happened yet
And maybe I'm a fool, but I just can't live with regret

You were the raging storm that wrecked
A beautiful mind I can't forget
Knew from the moment that we met I'd take you home
But, now that the future's so unclear
Have all of your feelings disappeared?
'Cause I'm in no kind of frame of mind to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Hope, have you some that I can borrow?
'Cause I've been so low
And the weight of all the world's a heavy load
Keep me going till tomorrow
'Cause I just don't know if I can face another day alone

[Chorus]
Well, my lungs don't breathe
And my heart don't beat
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
No, I just don't want any kind of life without you, dear

[Verse 2]
Are there any words that I could say?
I'm feeling our moment fade away
In a matter of hours, we'll be drowning in the waves
And, all of the memories that we shaped
We're leaving behind, here in my wake
If we can save the good we gave, we shouldn't wait

Now you're not here, I can't explain
The carousel of my constant pain
I'm not sure that I can hold on anymore
Became a victim of circumstance
Should've said when I had the chance

I will be your shoulder to cry on
I will make you laugh if you need
I will play the part if you say so
Yeah, I'll be anybody but me

[Pre-Chorus]
To tell you the truth, I'm a mess, I'm a fool
You don't know that
And you never will
In my mind, it's instilled not to show that

[Chorus]
I spend almost all of my time
Feeling like I'm falling even further behind
And I know I'm so good at seeming
Like I'm not on the edge of a knife
I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya?
Designed to deceive
So, tell me who you want me to be

[Verse 2]
I can wear a million faces
'Cause I don't like the one underneath
Always found it easy to fake it
Yeah, I'll be anybody but me

To tell you the truth, I'm the fraud in the room
And I know that
But you never will
In my mind, it's instilled not to show that

[Chorus]
I spend almost all of my time
Feeling like I'm falling even further behind
And I know I'm so good at seeming
Like I'm not on the edge of a knife
I feel like everything I do is a lie
And all the words just further pull the wool over eyes
I know I'm no good at being who I am away from the light
I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya?
Designed to deceive
So, tell me who you want me to be

[Bridge]
And I'll be
Be my best impression of what you expect from me
But what you don't see is

[Chorus]
I spend almost all of my time
Feeling like I'm falling even further behind
I know I'm so good at seeming
Like I'm not on the edge of a knife
I feel like everything I do is a lie
And all the words just further pull the wool over eyes
I know I'm no good at being who I am away from the light
I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya?
And I'm an imposter, but Hell is a mender
I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya?

Two heartbeats, never in time
Two lovers over enemy lines
I know we're broken but don't wanna believe it

[Verse 2]
You're so close to saying the words
Way past the point of any return
It's such a shame and I don't wanna believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if I could go back to that evening we met
Trembling hands as I'd ask for your number again
You saw me different then
Oh, when I held your heart in my hand

[Chorus]
So, if you're gonna leave me
Just leave me slowly
Let's make it last
Just one more dance
Before the moment's passed
I'd rather that you lay here
Than leave me lonely
So, stay for a while
Just one more mile
Before we say goodbye

You said, ""Who are we fooling?""
I guess that you gave up
On all that I am and all that I'm not
'Cause I'm fucking useless and full of excuses
I guess that you cut free
From all that we are and will never be

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the flowers are dead like the hearts in our chest
And I'm hanging my head 'cause I'm tryna forget
How we bled, and we bled, and we bled, and we bled

[Chorus]
So, this is where we ended up
All of those years that I wasted for lovе
And here it is, forevеrmore
The house is on fire and I can't find the door
If I had the heart to start it again
I'd stamp out the sparks in my own self-defence
Say, you ain't gonna like how this ends

[Verse 2]
You know, if we went back
To fix what we once had
There'd still be no chance
For you and me 'cause inevitably

All the flowers would die, and the tears from your eyes
Would come as no surprise as I tried to forget

All of those years that I wasted for love
And here it is, forevermore
The house is on fire and I can't find the door

I'd stamp out the sparks in my own self-defence
No, you ain't gonna like how this ends

[Bridge]
Broken with no way to mend
No, you ain't gonna like how this ends
I'm stuck here just tryna forget
How we bled, and we bled, and we bled, and we bled

Will you forgive me if I'm comin' off a little bit obtuse?
Well, it's been a minute now since I have had to tell the truth
I know I can
I won't

[Verse 2]
Suppose I thought that, by this moment, I would have it figured out
But, instead, I tend to spend my days consumed by seeds of doubt
I know I can
I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, darlin', it goes on and on and on
Always, forever, 'til I'm barely holdin' on
End of my tether and I know it won't be long
It won't be long 'til it's gone

[Chorus]
So here's to my beautiful life
That seems to leave me so unsatisfied
No sense of self, but self-obsessed
I'm always trapped inside my fuckin' head

And I guess that I should tell you I'm sorry
It seems I was the problem somehow

But, oh, my love
I wanna say, ""I miss the green in your eyes""
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, ""Without you, everything's wrong""
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best

Oh, woah

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Never spent so long on a losing battle
But lately, giving up don't seem to matter

And you're wasting away every night

Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love

I tore your world apart like it was nothing new
Never bled so much when I didn't have to

I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I've said a thousand things before
I've fallen in and out of love
I couldn't walk but tried to run
At night, the weight of expectation seems to keep me up
A thousand times, I said too much
Always second-guess before I jump
I gave my all, but not enough
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough

[Pre-Chorus]
How come I'm the only one who ever seems to get in my way?
Lately, I've been fucking up a good thing any chance I can get

[Chorus]
Somebody to lean on, somebody to hold
It's just another to lead, though, before I let go
And I ain't trying to be lonely, solely
But everything I touch turns to stone
Maybe I'm better off on my own

[Verse 2]
A thousand times, I've heard the same
I've heard some other voices in my head
Let me assure you that my mind's in check
I just can't put my faith in something we might live to regret

Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Verse 2]
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember

Long hours and a few dyin' flowers
But you never seem to stick around
How could you let somethin' so good
Go to waste and bleed the colours out?

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know what you got till it's gone
Know when it's right till it's wrong
In search of perfect when you had it with you all along
You broke her heart down with ease
Now I'm pickin' up every piece
You must be so hard to please

[Chorus]
I wish I could say
""Thank you for all the mistakes
Thank you for all of the pain""
I guess somebody else's loss is another's gain
I'm sayin' thank you to the one who let her get away
Away

She gave you love, but it wasn't enough
You had your mind set out on other things
Can't sleep at night, now you're payin' the price

I wish somebody would've told me

That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me

But don't fade away

And when I'm just about to pass the point of it all
You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

[Chorus]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

I don't know how we got to where we are
So far removed, I don't know where to start
'Cause I've been away for far too long
But I implore you, please hold on
I beg you, please hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
Love don't come easy to us
And it's killing me to hang on
And hope it's enough

[Chorus]
So, I was just wondering
Could you tell me, is it all a waste of time?
Are you leaving my love behind?
Baby, say the word and let me know
You gotta give me something
I swear that I won't try to change your mind
If you're leaving my love behind
Baby, say the word and let me go

[Verse 2]
We used to wait up and talk for hours on end
And it's got me thinking that lately something's changed
'Cause I've been feeling you leaving

Where'd you get to? Where'd you go?
I've been so lost since you left
Wish you kept leading me on
Tried to reach ya, tried to call
I bang my head against your door
But there ain't nobody home

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want to stay lost awhile
I'll rearrange the road I take
And meet you out in the wild
And if you want, we can wait behind
We can find a place to hide
Maybe I could change your mind

So, I'm holding out for something more
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again
Let it roll, let it roll, let me hold your heart of stone

[Verse 2]
If you think you might feel the same
I'll be right here where we left off
Same old story, same old place
I won't wander, I won't let go
'Cause there's more life in my bones
Than you give me credit for

Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Verse 2]
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember

I've said a thousand things before
I've fallen in and out of love
I couldn't walk but tried to run
At night, the weight of expectation seems to keep me up
A thousand times, I said too much
Always second-guess before I jump
I gave my all, but not enough
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough

[Pre-Chorus]
How come I'm the only one who ever seems to get in my way?
Lately, I've been fucking up a good thing any chance I can get

[Chorus]
Somebody to lean on, somebody to hold
It's just another to lead, though, before I let go
And I ain't trying to bе lonely, solely
But evеrything I touch turns to stone
Maybe I'm better off on my own

[Verse 2]
A thousand times, I've heard the same
I've heard some other voices in my head
Let me assure you that my mind's in check

I'm waitin' up, savin' all my precious time
Losin' light, I'm missin' my same old us
Before we learned our truth too late
Resigned to fate, fadin' away
So tell me, can you turn around?
I need someone to tear me down
Oh, tell me, can you turn around?
But either way

[Chorus]
Hold me while you wait
I wish that I was good enough (Hold me while you wait)
If only I could wake you up (Hold me while you wait)

Won't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)

Tell me more, tell me somеthing I don't know
Did we come close to havin' it all?
If you'rе gonna waste my time
Let's waste it right

And hold me while you wait
I wish that I was good enough (Hold me while you wait)
If only I could wake you up (Hold me while you wait)

Won't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)

Salt of the earth, my friend
It's all that we are in the end
Well, you trapped down all the lines you drew
And I can take the hit but I'm sorry, I don't want the bruise
Your voice gets a little loud
When there's nothing to talk about, you shout, dear

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll find my lights fading out
More and more by the hour
It gets dark in here

[Chorus]
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me

[Verse 2]
Dust to dust, my friend
Wеll, you're only blood and bones
And I know your heart's at war with your hеad
I am sure it hurt to see
You're more than I'll ever have
And more than I'll ever be
I know it's a little late
My timing was never great
But I'm calling, dear

That I won't bother you anymore
I'll be gone this time next year

Sing me a song and send me to sleep

Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
I never thought that a lie could sound so sweet
Until you opened your mouth
And you said you loved meEmbed"

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must bе something in the water
'Causе every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Of what we had because it's over

Now we're separated by oceans, vast
Couldn't make this last

It ain't no wonder why we lose control
When we're always a heart attack away from falling in love

To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far
Running near on empty
I wish somebody would've told me

[Chorus]

That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me

But don't fade away

You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs

If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?

Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Verse 2]
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

Nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there

That doesn't mean it was a lie, they'll never
Take those long summer days
When love was untamed
Two burning hearts are dared to break, remember
Nobody said that it would last foreverEmbed"

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me

I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me

Well, you're only blood and bones
And I know your heart's at war with your head
I am sure it hurt to see

And more than I'll ever be

But I'm calling, dear

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they’re gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I’d have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Before you go
Was there something I could’ve said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I’d have known you had a storm to weather

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over

This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

I've said a thousand things before
I've fallen in and out of love
I couldn't walk but tried to run
At night, the weight of expectation seems to keep me up
A thousand times, I said too much
Always second-guess before I jump
I gave my all, but not enough
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough

[Pre-Chorus]
How come I'm the only one who ever seems to get in my way?
Lately, I've been fucking up a good thing any chance I can get

[Chorus]
Somebody to lean on, somebody to hold
It's just another to lead, though, before I let go
And I ain't trying to be lonely, solely
But everything I touch turns to stone
Maybe I'm better off on my own

[Verse 2]
A thousand times, I've heard the same
I've heard some other voices in my head
Let me assure you that my mind's in check

No regrets is what we said

Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

Go to waste and bleed the colours out?

Pray silence, I'm begging
Too tired to tell you I ain't coming home
Stop for a second
Guess I got caught up in leading you on
And I ain't responsible for the lump in your throat

[Pre-Chorus]
Haven't you had enough of all of this?
Haven't you had enough of loneliness?

[Chorus]
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to stay too long
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to tell you whatever you want
But haven't you had enough of loneliness?
And haven't we had enough of second best?
So don't get me wrong

[Verse 2]
Innocent then
Way back before we knew how to pretend
Picking up where we left
It ain't meant to be easy, shouldn't be hard as this
And I ain't responsible for letting this go

It hurts the most when you come too close

Out of focus, didn't take a second to notice
Now we're separated by oceans, vast
Couldn't make this last

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart unsteady
Then it breaks, so I'm prayin' that you're feelin' the same

You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryin' to find
Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?

All the streetlights illuminate what home used to feel like
And when I get to thinkin', can't sleep at night
No, I don't feel right

Lately, I'm getting lost on you
You got me doing things I never thought I'd do
Never spent so long on a losing battle
But lately, giving up don't seem to matter

[Chorus]
Every day, I'm a slave to the heartache
And you're wasting away every night
I don't wanna leave you lonely
But I've run out of love this time
You know that I adore you
Though I couldn't give enough
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love

Lately, I'm getting lost on you
I tore your world apart like it was nothing new
Never bled so much when I didn't have to

And you're wasting away every night

It ain't no wonder why we lose control
When we're always a heart attack away from falling in love
Well, I know that we've been hardly holding on
To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far
Running near on empty
I wish somebody would've told me

[Chorus]
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me
Girl, you make my heart break more every day
But don't fade away

[Verse 2]
And when I'm just about to pass the point of it all
You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs
And now it's so hard to breathe
I wish somebody would've told me

[Chorus]
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray

Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This  all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I  need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I  guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now  the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I  let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now,  I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taken
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Of what we had because it's over

I've said a thousand things before
I've fallen in and out of love
I couldn't walk but tried to run
At night, the weight of expectation seems to keep me up
A thousand times, I said too much
Always second-guess before I jump
I gave my all, but not enough
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough

[Pre-Chorus]
How come I'm the only one who ever seems to get in my way?
Lately, I've been fucking up a good thing any chance I can get

[Chorus]
Somebody to lean on, somebody to hold
It's just another to lead, though, before I let go
And I ain't trying to be lonely, solely
But everything I touch turns to stone
Maybe I'm better off on my own

[Verse 2]
A thousand times, I've heard the same
I've heard some other voices in my head
Let me assure you that my mind's in check
I just can't put my faith in something we might live to regret

But everything I touch turns to stone
Maybe I'm better off on my own5Embed"

Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Verse 2]
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

Two burning hearts are dared to break, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever22Embed"

Long hours and a few dyin' flowers
But you never seem to stick around
How could you let somethin' so good
Go to waste and bleed the colours out?

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know what you got till it's gone
Know when it's right till it's wrong
In search of perfect when you had it with you all along
You broke her heart down with ease
Now I'm pickin' up every piece
You must be so hard to please

[Chorus]
I wish I could say
""Thank you for all the mistakes
Thank you for all of the pain""
I guess somebody else's loss is another's gain
I'm sayin' thank you to the one who let her get away
Away

[Verse 2]
She gave you love, but it wasn't enough
You had your mind set out on other things
Can't sleep at night, now you're payin' the price

Guess I got caught up in leading you on
And I ain't responsible for the lump in your throat

Haven't you had enough of all of this?

But haven't you had enough of loneliness?
And haven't we had enough of second best?
So don't get me wrong

Way back before we knew how to pretend

Now we're separated by oceans, vast
Couldn't make this last

Make your heart unsteady

Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart

And when I get to thinkin', can't sleep at night

You got me doing things I never thought I'd do
Never spent so long on a losing battle
But lately, giving up don't seem to matter

And you're wasting away every night
I don't wanna leave you lonely
But I've run out of love this time
You know that I adore you
Though I couldn't give enough
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love

I tore your world apart like it was nothing new
Never bled so much when I didn't have to

Running near on empty
I wish somebody would've told me

That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me
Girl, you make my heart break more every day
But don't fade away

And when I'm just about to pass the point of it all
You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs

Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

[Chorus]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

I don't know how we got to where we are
So far removed, I don't know where to start
'Cause I've been away for far too long
But I implore you, please hold on
I beg you, please hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
Love don't come easy to us
And it's killing me to hang on
And hope it's enough

[Chorus]
So, I was just wondering
Could you tell me, is it all a waste of time?
Are you leaving my love behind?
Baby, say the word and let me know
You gotta give me something
I swear that I won't try to change your mind
If you're leaving my love behind
Baby, say the word and let me go

[Verse 2]
We used to wait up and talk for hours on end
And it's got me thinking that lately something's changed
'Cause I've been feeling you leaving
Cracks in conversations way too long
I'm barely holding on

Just let me go, let me go

Where'd you get to? Where'd you go?
I've been so lost since you left
Wish you kept leading me on
Tried to reach ya, tried to call
I bang my head against your door
But there ain't nobody home

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want to stay lost awhile
I'll rearrange the road I take
And meet you out in the wild
And if you want, we can wait behind
We can find a place to hide
Maybe I could change your mind

[Chorus]
So, I'm holding out for something more
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again
Let it roll, let it roll, let me hold your heart of stone

[Verse 2]
If you think you might feel the same
I'll be right here where we left off
Same old story, same old place
I won't wander, I won't let go
'Cause there's more life in my bones
Than you give me credit for
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want to stay lost awhile
I'll rearrange the road I take
And meet you out in the wild
And if you want, we can wait behind

So, I'm holding out for something more
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again

You don't need to lose control, I just wanna let you know
I'm holding on to make you whole, don't let go, don't let go
You don't need to lose control, I just wanna let you know
I'm holding on to make you whole, don't let go, don't let go

Salt of the earth, my friend
It's all that we are in the end
Well, you trapped down all the lines you drew
And I can take the hit but I'm sorry, I don't want the bruise
Your voice gets a little loud
When there's nothing to talk about, you shout, dear

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll find my lights fading out
More and more by the hour
It gets dark in here

[Chorus]
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me

[Verse 2]
Dust to dust, my friend
Well, you're only blood and bones
And I know your heart's at war with your head
I am sure it hurt to see
You're more than I'll ever have
And more than I'll ever be
I know it's a little late
My timing was never great
But I'm calling, dear
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanted to let you know
That I won't bother you anymore
I'll be gone this time next year

[Chorus]
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
I never thought that a lie could sound so sweet
Until you opened your mouth
And you said you loved meEmbed"

Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Verse 2]
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine, sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember

I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

And you're not here to get me through it all

To finally drive up to your house
And today I drove through the suburbs

'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I've said a thousand things before
I've fallen in and out of love
I couldn't walk but tried to run
At night, the weight of expectation seems to keep me up
A thousand times, I said too much
Always second-guess before I jump
I gave my all, but not enough
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough

[Pre-Chorus]
How come I'm the only one who ever seems to get in my way?
Lately, I've been fucking up a good thing any chance I can get

[Chorus]
Somebody to lean on, somebody to hold
It's just another to lead, though, before I let go
And I ain't trying to be lonely, solely
But everything I touch turns to stone
Maybe I'm better off on my own

[Verse 2]
A thousand times, I've heard the same
I've heard some other voices in my head
Let me assure you that my mind's in check
I just can't put my faith in something we might live to regret

Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Verse 2]
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

Long hours and a few dyin' flowers
But you never seem to stick around
How could you let somethin' so good
Go to waste and bleed the colours out?

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know what you got till it's gone
Know when it's right till it's wrong
In search of perfect when you had it with you all along
You broke her heart down with ease
Now I'm pickin' up every piece
You must be so hard to please

[Chorus]
I wish I could say
""Thank you for all the mistakes
Thank you for all of the pain""
I guess somebody else's loss is another's gain
I'm sayin' thank you to the one who let her get away
Away

Salt of the earth, my friend
It's all that we are in the end
Well, you trapped down all the lines you drew
And I can take the hit but I'm sorry, I don't want the bruise
Your voice gets a little loud
When there's nothing to talk about, you shout, dear

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll find my lights fading out
More and more by the hour
It gets dark in here

[Chorus]
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me

[Verse 2]
Dust to dust, my friend
Well, you're only blood and bones
And I know your heart's at war with your head
I am sure it hurt to see
You're more than I'll ever have
And more than I'll ever be
I know it's a little late
My timing was never great
But I'm calling, dear
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanted to let you know
That I won't bother you anymore
I'll be gone this time next year

[Chorus]
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
I never thought that a lie could sound so sweet
Until you opened your mouth
And you said you loved me11Embed"

Every little part of me is holding on to every little piece of you
Is holding on to every drop of blood you drew
Is holding onto you
And every waking hour I spend
Holding out for reasons not to go to bed
I'm holding out for someone else to hold instead
If every hope of you is dead

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every night since you cut and run
I feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking
With every step that you're taking

[Chorus]
'Cause you've been running circles 'round
My mind, turning me inside out
And I fell for you but hit the ground
'Cause the only love I've known has let me
Down and I need lifting up
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough
And I'm praying I can pray enough
So waking up without you ain’t so tough

[Verse 2]
Find it hard to find my feet
When I keep on stumbling over you and me
But I keep on trying 'cause I know I need
To outrun the memories

And I fell for you but hit the ground

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

And you're not here to get me through it all

I've been feeling every second
Since she told me we were through
Been going hell for leather
'Cause there's fuck all else to do
And she stumbled through some problems
Said, ""You're the only wrong in me""
But I've been missing something
Bring your body home to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wasting my time?
Oh, I'm tryna find any truth in between the lies
Am I wasting my time?
Replaying conversations running 'round in my mind

[Chorus]
Didn't wanna be a love let go
Barely getting by on my own
Guess I'll always be holding on to something borrowed
Didn't wanna sing myself away
For long nights into wasted days
Saying her name like something borrowed

Feeling sorry for myself
Been wondering who she's holding

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under56Embed"

For every second you been talking
I've been tryna count the lines around your face
'Cause I don't know if I'll ever be this close again

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like I'm just wasting time
Before you pull the trigger
It's the drawing of the line
It's my ghost you're gonna give up
Got your made up mind
It hurts to see you're alright
When I'm not alright
So if you're calling it a night

[Chorus]
Oh please have, have mercy
Have mercy on me, you're breaking my heart
Oh please have, have mercy
Have mercy on me, I'm falling apart
Have mercy, my heart

[Verse 2]
I felt you slip away so slowly
I lost my grip a little more each time we touched
I've got no hope I guess I'll never get it back again
Yeah-yeah, yeah

Feel like I was just wasting time
Before you pulled the trigger
It's the drawing of the line
It's my ghost you're going to give up
Got your made up mind
It hurts to see you're alright
When I'm not alright
So if you're calling it a night

[Chorus]
Oh please have, have mercy
Have mercy on me, you're breaking my heart
Oh please have, have mercy
Have mercy on me, I'm falling apart
And I just don't know how we got it
So wrong, for so long
Oh please have, have mercy
Have mercy on me, mercy my heart

[Bridge]
Somehow I can't let go
But I know I've been holding on too long
Somehow I can't let go
But I know I've been holding on too long
Oh
[Chorus]
Oh please have, have mercy
Have mercy on me, you're breaking my heart
Oh please have, have mercy
Have mercy on me, I'm falling apart
And I just don't know how we got it
So wrong, for so long
Oh please have, have mercy
Have mercy on me, mercy my heart
Have mercy my heart2Embed"

Lately, I'm getting lost on you
You got me doing things I never thought I'd do
Never spent so long on a losing battle
But lately, giving up don't seem to matter

[Chorus]
Every day, I'm a slave to the heartache
And you're wasting away every night
I don't wanna leave you lonely
But I've run out of love this time
You know that I adore you
Though I couldn't give enough
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love

[Verse 2]
Lately, I'm getting lost on you
I tore your world apart like it was nothing new
Never bled so much when I didn't have to
I'm givin' up on a life lived after

[Chorus]
Every day, I'm a slave to the heartache
And you're wasting away every night
I don't wanna leave you lonely
But I've run out of love this time
You know that I adore you
Though I couldn't give enough
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love
You might also like[Bridge]
I had a hold on your soul
But I lost my grip, let you go
I should've carried us both

[Chorus]
Every day, I'm a slave to the heartache
And you're wasting away every night
Don't wanna leave you lonely
But I've run out of love this time
You know that I adore you
Though I couldn't give enough
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love, of your love
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love7Embed"
