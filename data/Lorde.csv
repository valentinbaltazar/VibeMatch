[Verse 1]
Allow me to set the scene
When I met you, I'd never done ecstasy
Just a girl with a dream
Remember?
Back then I still had wisdom teeth
In my hair, just a girl in the night
In the bed I would still fake a scream of pleasure
But can you see now?

[Pre-Chorus]
That girl is a woman so call a stretch limousine
For her desires and demons, you don't know what she's seen
There are ghosts that she hides
But you know all she wants is to get down

[Chorus]
Every night, the silver moon, it changes
Can you say the same? Do you stay the same?
Can you change with me? Can I be honest?
Can I press where it hurts, my baby?
I wanna ride with you

[Verse 2]
Baby, we love in extremes
Every touch like a prayer
When we're there, can't compare
Tell me why do we need to suffer?
Feels like the AC is broken
I said something that touched a nerve
You blow up and I go dark
The way my mother does
The angels cry for us
'Cause they can see now

Can you say the same? Do you stay the same?

[Bridge]
Baby, when the moon is gleamin'
With your heart open, breathe in
I would never dream of leavin'

With your heart open, breathe in

[Verse]
Friends of mine
We're in the prime of our lives
I think it's high time your self preservation
Met my rising sun
Overnight
Strange overtones bring everything to life
Behind his back I use invisible ink
Color outside the lines with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Wide awake, I'm afraid in my body
Headless behavior, I want you to stop me
All of the sick twisted things I should swallow

[Chorus]
Let the bodies move, we'll sing the incantation
Fallin' right into you, choose pleasure over patience
Is this a mistake? The right thing to do?
Holdin' hands with my angels
I let them choose
Let the bodies move, give into this temptation
Fallin' right into you, choose pleasure over patience
Is this a mistake? The right thing to do?
Holdin' hands with my angels
I let them choose

Knew that's it, I'll never be the same
That's when the doors swung open
And a voice said, ""We're glad you came""
Now I've spent thousands on you, darling
All the hotels and the jets
And I'd pay it all again to have your golden body back in my bed
But I don't miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Goodbye to all the bottles, all the models
Bye to the clouds in thе skies that all hold no rain

[Chorus]
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California lovе

[Verse 2]
Oh, once upon a time, the Canyon store
Was where my world began
All that mystery and beauty gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
But it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck
Now in my hometown, sunbathing
My girlfriends and my baby
But every time I smell tequila
The garden grows up in my mind again

Goodbye to all the bottles, all the models
Bye to the kids in the lines for the new Supreme

[Chorus]
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love

Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

[Chorus]
'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybе I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stonеd at the nail salon again

[Verse 2]
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means

[Chorus]
Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you

To the ones who came before us
All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big

And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendor where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit

[Chorus]
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit (Ooh)
The fallen fruit
[Bridge]
From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers
And a pocketful of seed
It's time for us to leave

And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose?

Dancing with my girls, only having two drinks, then leaving
It's a funny thing, thought you’d never gain self-control
Guess it's been a while since you last said sorry
Crying in the dark at your best friends' parties
You’ve had enough, gotta turn the lights up, go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't wait to turn fifteen
Then you blink and it's been ten years
Growing up a little at a time, then all at once
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself, my love
You can take 'em if you want 'em, these are just

[Chorus]
Secrets from a girl who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl who's seen it
Secrets from a girl
Secrets from a girl who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl (Secrets from a girl)
Secrets from a girl who’s seen it all

[Verse 2]
’Member all the hurt you would feel when you weren't desired? (Doing anything for more touch)
’Member what you thought was grief before you got the call?
Baby girl, no one's gonna feel the pain for you
You're gonna love again, so just try staying open
And when the time comes, you'll fall
Yeah, when the time comes, you’ll fall

Welcome to Sadness
The temperature is unbearable until you face it
Thank you for flying with Strange Airlines, I will be your tour guide today
Your emotional baggage can be picked up at carousel number two
Please be careful so it doesn't fall onto someone you love
When we've reached your final destination, I will leave you to it
You'll be fine
I'm just gonna show you in and, um...
You can stay as long as you need to get familiar with the feeling
And then when you're ready, I'll be outside, and...
We can go look at the sunrise by euphoria, mixed with existential vertigo?

If I had to break it down
I'd say it's the way you love to dance
Movin' the furniture when my back is turned
The flick of the lights and the world falls away

[Chorus]
And your office job and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed
For all these years

[Verse 2]
I thought I was a genius, but now I'm twenty-two
And it's startin' to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away

[Chorus]
With my fistful of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds like favourite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away

[Verse 3]
I've got hundreds of gowns, I've got paintings in frames
And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully fallin' apart for the Princess of Norway

But you with your doll's lashes, your infinite T-shirts
I should've known when your favourite record was the same as my father's
You'd take me down

[Verse 4]
I guess I'll always be this way
Swallowed up by the words and halfway to space
But there by the fire, you offered your hand
And as I took it, I loved you, the boy with the plan

[Chorus]
You felled me clean as a pine
The man with the axe and the look in his eyes
We've been through so many hard times

And all the livin' things under the sun

Will she split a tab with her lover?
And laugh at the stars like her mother

Born in the year of OxyContin
Raised in the tall grass
Teen millionaire having nightmares from the camera flash
Now I'm alone on a windswept island
Caught in the complex divorce of the seasons
Won't take the call if it's the label or the radio

[Verse 2]
Arm in a cast at the museum gala
Fork in my purse to take home to my mother
Supermodels all dancing 'round a pharaoh's tomb

[Chorus]
Now if you're looking for a saviour, well, that's not me
You need someone to take your pain for you?
Well, that's not me
'Cause we are all broken and sad
Where arе the dreams that we had?
Can't find thе dreams that we had
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Let's hope the sun will show us the path, path
Let's hope the sun will show us the path, path
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Saviour is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Saviour is not me

Once upon a time in Hollywood
When Carole called my name
I stood up, the room exploded, and I
Knew that's it, I'll never be the same
That's when the doors swung open
And a voice said, ""We're glad you came""
Now I've spent thousands on you, darling
All the hotels and the jets
And I'd pay it all again to have your golden body back in my bed
But I don't miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Goodbye to all the bottles, all the models
Bye to the clouds in thе skies that all hold no rain

[Chorus]
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California lovе

[Verse 2]
Oh, once upon a time, the Canyon store
Was where my world began
All that mystery and beauty gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
But it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck
Now in my hometown, sunbathing
My girlfriends and my baby
But every time I smell tequila
The garden grows up in my mind again

Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing

Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybе I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stonеd at the nail salon again

[Verse 2]
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers

All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big

And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendor where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit

The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit (Ooh)

From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers
And a pocketful of seed
It's time for us to leave

But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose?

Dancing with my girls, only having two drinks, then leaving
It's a funny thing, thought you’d never gain self-control
Guess it's been a while since you last said sorry
Crying in the dark at your best friends' parties
You’ve had enough, gotta turn the lights up, go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't wait to turn fifteen
Then you blink and it's been ten years
Growing up a little at a time, then all at once
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself, my love
You can take 'em if you want 'em, these are just

Secrets from a girl who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl who's seen it
Secrets from a girl
Secrets from a girl who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl (Secrets from a girl)
Secrets from a girl who’s seen it all

[Verse 2]
’Member all the hurt you would feel when you weren't desired? (Doing anything for more touch)
’Member what you thought was grief before you got the call?
Baby girl, no one's gonna feel the pain for you
You're gonna love again, so just try staying open
And when the time comes, you'll fall
Yeah, when the time comes, you’ll fall

Thank you for flying with Strange Airlines, I will be your tour guide today

Please be careful so it doesn't fall onto someone you love
When we've reached your final destination, I will leave you to it
You'll be fine

And then when you're ready, I'll be outside, and...

And your office job and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed

And it's startin' to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away

With my fistful of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds like favourite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away

And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully fallin' apart for the Princess of Norway

Swallowed up by the words and halfway to space
But there by the fire, you offered your hand
And as I took it, I loved you, the boy with the plan

I'm tryna blow bubbles, but inside
Can't seem to fix my mood
Today, it's as dark as my roots
If I, if I ever let them grow out (Ah-ah)
Now all of my oceans have riptides
Can't seem to find what's wrong
The whole world is letting me down
Don't you think the early 2000s seem so far away? (Ay-ay-ay-ay)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ladies, begin your sun salutations
Transcendental in your meditations (Love and light)
You can burn sage and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right)

[Chorus]
I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away

[Verse 2]
I'm tryna get well from the inside
Plants and celebrity news, all the vitamins I consume
Let's fly somewherе eastern, they'll havе what I need (They'll have what I need)

I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away
All the sad girls sing
We'll keep dancing 'til the mood rings
Tell us how we're feeling
Floating away, floating away

It's a blue day
We could jump Bulli

I think about my father
Doin' the same thing
When he was a boy
When he was a boy
It's a blue day
We could go fishing
You'll catch the big one
Ah

[Verse 1]
Slidin' the knife under the skin
Grateful for this offering
And all the livin' things under the sun
Under the sun

[Verse 2]
Little brother, I think you're an angel
I see your silver chain levitate
When you're kickflipping
Baby boy, you're super cool
I know you're scared, so was I
But all will be revealed in time (Time, time)

I can make anything real

[Verse 4]
In the future
If I have a daughter
Will she have my waist
Or my widow's peak?
My dreamer's disposition or my wicked streak?

[Verse 5]
Will she split a tab with her lover?
And laugh at the stars like her mother
When she was a girl?
When she was a girl?

[Refrain]
Now the cherry-black lipstick's gathering dust in a drawer
I don't need her anymore
'Cause I got this power
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)

You've heard it all before
One minute, I was killing 'em all
And the next, a brown suit wouldn't let me perform, ah
Typical
So I took a happy face
And it's coming on like a charm
I don't wanna get lost, I wanna worship the sun
If you want, you can come

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in my own little golden age
But it's such a pill when they don't appreciate

[Chorus]
So when you smoke that cigarette
Or when you talk shit 'bout an old friend
I know it's hard, but do your best
Give yourself a break, have a little faith, ah
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modеrn world

[Verse 2]
They're banging on the door
""Evеryone please make way
For the girl who looks like she flew in from outer space
Yesterday, eh""
I think I'll wait it out

Remember when we used to sing, baby, up in your room
Before your mother got home?
There was a sound to our innocence
Our voices were lovers in the same bed
Now I'm not sure how they would sound, isn't that sad?
Now that the ocean's all waves and the diamonds are blood
There's a new girl on your song
I didn't know that I could be replaced
Years ago, I tried to get a message to you
But I never heard back, I never heard back

[Pre-Chorus]
Where did we go wrong?
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me

[Chorus]
No, I don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up?
Well, I know that some shit was said and done
But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone

[Post-Chorus]
Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old Citroën?
And remember when we took them on?
Stoners on the run, How the West Was Won

Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

[Chorus]
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

[Post-Chorus]
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Go for it
One, two

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
Till all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting, running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Outro]
They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun150Embed"

Break the news—you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Chorus]
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

[Verse 2]
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I’ve stopped needing you

Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?

We're king and queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care, but we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
[Bridge]
Midnight, we're fading
Till daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with
All the heartache and the treason
The fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)
Dancing with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

[Chorus]
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (But what about love?)
Nothing wrong with it, supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

Go for it
One, two

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
Till all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting, running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability

So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability

Go back and tell it

[Verse 1]
Please, could you be tender?
And I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go

[Chorus]
Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

When you've outgrown a lover (Oh)
The whole world knows but you (Oh)
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

Three years, loved you every single day
Made me weak, it was real for me, yeah, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day
'Til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave

How we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me

Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

[Verse 2]
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine

Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing, I'm alright
It's just another graceless night
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh-oh-oh (Tch-tch)
[Chorus]
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

Meet somebody, take 'em home

Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone

All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?

I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
(Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar)

[Refrain]
Well, those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

[Pre-Chorus]
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus]
'Cause honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go

Oh God, I'm clean out of air
In my lungs, it's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh (Hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah-ha)

[Chorus]
We're king and queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care, but we care

Till daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with
All the heartache and the treason
The fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us

Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

[Chorus]
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Go for it
One, two

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

Better on my own

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me

Break the news—you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Chorus]
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

[Verse 2]
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I’ve stopped needing you

These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

But when we're dancing, I'm alright

Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh

She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar

Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?

Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go

Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it

Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)

On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space

Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them

The drink you spilt all over me
""Lover's Spit"" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

So now we live beside the pool

Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste

Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

For a love they won't receive

There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
(Drop-drop-drop-drop) Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious

Delicate in every way but one (The swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (The old ways)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

[Bridge]
No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises
We'll always win at this, I don't ever think about death
It's all right if you do, it's fine
We gladiate, but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughin' up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain
""Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?""
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means
[Chorus]
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand

Hey, promise I can stay good

All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn, it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

[Verse 2]
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, ""Oh""

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

[Verse 2]
Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

All my life
I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

[Verse 2]
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
You might also like[Chorus]
I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, ""Oh""

[Instumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that

Don't you think that it's
Boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasin' a million things I want
And I am
Only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon, I'll be getting
On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space
But my head's
Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever (Yeah)

I'll fall apart, with all my heart (Yeah)

We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
Till the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow but we're brave

[Chorus]
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

While you're waiting out front

[Pre-Chorus]

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
(Drop-drop-drop-drop) Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious
You might also like[Verse 2]
Delicate in every way but one (The swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (The old ways)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious

[Bridge]
No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises
We'll always win at this, I don't ever think about death
It's all right if you do, it's fine
We gladiate, but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughin' up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain
""Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?""
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means
[Chorus]
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious

Today is my birthday and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
Everything I say falls right back into everything

But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over onstage
Hey, it's all cool
I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good

[Pre-Chorus]
(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown

Give the bruises out like gifts

We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross, but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to
And Jamie picks fights, but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in every summer like it's shameful to be underneath
The ceiling or a roof, try come out and steal our thunder

[Verse 2]
Now the days are getting cooler and the burning of our limbs
Doesn't happen quite as bad and the burn is just skin
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter
Like the movies that we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go, I can feel the subtle taste
Of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
But you come over at night and we practise all the breathing

[Chorus]
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic, but you never said
We're gettin' dead and it's the right way

All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn, it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

[Verse 2]
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, ""Oh""

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

[Verse 2]
Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

Don't you think that it's
Boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasin' a million things I want
And I am
Only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon, I'll be getting
On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space
But my head's
Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever (Yeah)

Till the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you

You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow but we're brave

I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say

I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway

We move in the tree streets

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)

We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises
We'll always win at this, I don't ever think about death
It's all right if you do, it's fine
We gladiate, but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughin' up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain
""Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?""
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means
[Chorus]
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious

Today is my birthday and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
Everything I say falls right back into everything

[Refrain]
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

[Verse 2]
Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over onstage
Hey, it's all cool
I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good

[Pre-Chorus]
(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I'm coming for you
(Chase paper, get by)
I'm little but I'm coming for the title held by everyone who's up

And if I like it, then we'll stay
Impress the empress; take a shot now

I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

If you want, we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling, but the notes from my admirers
Fill the dashboard just the same, ah, ah-ah

This is ""Buzzcut Season""

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby, it's okay)

Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

[Verse 2]
We ride the bus with our knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with our knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

Getting caught's half of the trip, though, isn't it? (Yeah)
I'll fall apart, with all my heart (Yeah)
And you could watch from your window (Yeah)
Haha

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

[Verse 2]
Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn, it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

[Verse 2]
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, ""Oh""

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

I'm in a clique, but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days, there was enough
The card games and knees with the bitter salt of blood
I was in, but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head:
""What about the kid?"" It's time the kid got free

[Chorus]
Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

[Verse 2]
I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's somethin' about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too real
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sittin' pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want, except to be alone

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member, go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end
