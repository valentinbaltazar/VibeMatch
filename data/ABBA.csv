My, my
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

[Pre-Chorus]
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Verse 2]
My, my
I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Jo, jo - man värjer sig och fäktas i det längsta

I still have faith in you
I see it now
Through all these years, that faith lives on somehow
There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare and oh-so hard to find

[Refrain]
Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

[Verse 2]
I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way
But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far

For I know I hear a bittеrsweet song

I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love

Humble and grateful
To have survived

I can remember when you left Kilkenny
And you told me, ""I'll return next year""
I never meant to hold you to your promise
And the years went by and I'm still here

[Chorus]
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the village fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me?

[Verse 2]
So is the outside world as you imaginеd?
Was it worth it severing the tiеs?
Happy to see me or a bit embarrassed?
There's a darkness deep in your blue eyes

[Chorus]
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the village fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be

Soon enough, they'll be waking up from their dreams
Children bursting with giggles and screams

As a brand-new day is dawning on this lovely Christmas morning
It's our children playing with their new toys
Little moments of happiness and of bliss
Does it ever get better than this?

A while ago, I heard the sound of children's laughter
Now it's quiet, so I guess they left the park
This wooden bench is getting harder by the hour
The sun is going down, it's getting dark
I realise I'm cold, the rain begins to pour
As I watch the windows on the second floor
The lights are on, it's time to go
It's time at last to let him know

[Verse 2]
I believe it would be fair to say
You look bewildered
And you wonder why I'm here today
And so you should, I would
When I left, I felt I'd had еnough
But in the shape and form I appear now
I havе learned to cope
And love and hope is why I am here now

[Chorus]
And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah
I'm fired up, don't shut me down
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down
I'm not the one you knew
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind (And I won't be the same)
I'm not the same this time around (Ooh)
I'm fired up, don't shut me down

You're asleep on the couch with Tammy
And she looks straight up at me
The reproach in her eyes is imagined
But the pain that I feel is real
She jumps down and her tail is swishing
Like a feather right under your nose
And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed
I say I'm sorry, I can see you cried

[Verse 2]
You look frail as you stand before me
Then you curse and kick a chair
And the dog, bless her heart, licks my fingers
But she jerks every time you swear
I feel sick and my hands arе shakin'
This is how all our fights have begun
You say you've had it and you say, ""Scrеw you""
I say I love you and I know it's true

[Chorus]
You're not the man you should have been
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could've been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now
You might also like[Verse 3]
You're confused when you turn to face me
Is it true or is she drunk?
But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom
I'm aware of how far I've sunk
And the dog is the first to feel it
There's a shimmer of hope in your eyes
You can't believe it, but you're close to tears
Oh God, I'm sorry for the wasted years

[Chorus]
(Not the one I could've been)
You're not the man you should have been (I let you down)
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could've been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now2Embed"

And I feel so bad
My little boy looks so happy, he throws me his ""Go, mummy"" kiss
And he loves his dad

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I loved him, too
Maybe I still do
But it's over
[Chorus]
Keep an eye on Dan
Promise me you can
He gets out of hand if you let him
So keep an eye on Dan (Keep an eye on Dan)
And don't forget (And don't forget)
I'll be back on Sunday to get him
So keep an eye on Dan

Funny how it takes me back to our first date

He likes the lilacs in my garden
I love to watch him fly
He's just a tiny, fuzzy ball
And I wonder how he can fly at all
A world without him
I dread to think what that would be
And I imagine my distress
It would be a new kind of loneliness

[Chorus]
But for now, I'm in my garden
Watching clouds sail with the breeze
Feeling carefree as I listen
To the hum of bumblebees

[Verse 2]
It's quite absurd, this summer morning
To think we could be trapped
Inside a world where all is changing
Too fast for bumblebees to adapt
From thyme to bluebell
From hyacinth to lily rose
Oh, how I do adore the sight
Of his rather clumsy, erratic flight
You might also like[Chorus]
And for now, I'm in my garden

Hear the hum of bumblebees

I messed it up, alright, and there's no doubt about it
I had to pick this fight 'cause I'd go mad without it
Bending like a willow when a storm is brewing
Oh, yeah, that's you, but hey, I take the rap
This one's my mishap and there's no doubt about it

[Verse 1]
He tells me that he won't take the bait
That I have a tendency to exaggerate
And maybe he's right, but that is beside the point
Well, then why do I let it upset me?
Yes, and why am I biting my nails?

[Chorus]
I made a mess this time and thеre's no doubt about it
Hands down, the fault is mine, and I'm prеpared to shout it
Out across the rooftops if it makes you happy
Oh, yes, I could, so hey, I take the blame
This one's got my name and there's no doubt about it

[Verse 2]
He says with forbearance in his eyes
Most couples we know are able to compromise
He's too good for me, that's one thing I know for sure
If that's true, why do I let it upset me?
There I go, stomping my feet like a child

Hissing like a wild cat when I should be purring

If I ever write my Ode to Freedom
It will be in prose that chimes with me
It would be a simple Ode to Freedom
Not pretentious, but with dignity
I would like to think that freedom is
More than just a word
In grand and lofty language
Odes to Freedom often go unheard

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
If I ever wrote my Ode to Freedom
Being privileged and spoilt for choice
Then I fear that you would be suspicious
Of the cause to which I'd lend my voice
It's elusive and it's hard to hold
It's a fleeting thing
That's why there is no Ode to Freedom truly worth remembering
I wish someone would write an Ode to Freedom that we all could singYou might also like2Embed"

Keeping me so busy all the day through
They're the things that keep me from thinking of you
(Oh, baby, I miss you so, I know I'm never gonna make it)
Oh, I'm so restless, I don't care what I say
And I lose my temper ten times a day
Still, it's even worse when the night's on its way
It's bad, oh, so bad

Sitting here alone and staring at the wall

No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn]
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
This time we're through, this time we're really through
This time we're through, we're really through
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

[Verse 2: Frida & Agnetha]
Memories, good days, bad days
Memories, good days, bad days
They'll be with me always
They'll be with me always
In these old familiar rooms children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn]

In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now, I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together

How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more
Like you did before

I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando

I've seen you twice, in a short time

I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

Does it mean anything to you?

Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

And you make me talk
Doo-doo, doo-doo
And you make me feel
Doo-doo, doo-doo
And you make me show
Doo-doo, doo-doo
What I'm trying to conceal
Doo-doo, doo-doo
If I trust in you
Doo-doo, doo-doo
Would you let me down?
Doo-doo, doo-doo
Would you laugh at me
Doo-doo, doo-doo
If I said I care for you?
Ah-ah
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know

'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural. but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

[Verse 2: Björn]
Falling in love with a woman like you
It happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Men are toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw 'em away
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

[Chorus: Frida]
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be him and I

""Come on, we need your help on this one!""

[Verse 1]
You're so hot, teasing me
So you’re blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn’t do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child

[Chorus]
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

[Post-Chorus]
Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you’re so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Smile, but girl, you’re only a child

[Chorus]
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you’re out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

[Post-Chorus]
Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?

Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow

Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen

It's an evil world that has only made me a girl

And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he says he loves you, and life has just begun

I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still, strange as it seems to me
You brought it back to me
That old feeling

You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me

You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I've laid my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you

Did you see that man in the limousine?
With the pretty girl, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill

[Verse 2]
Did you see that man with a fat cigar?
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
While the rest of us drink a beer

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle

Well, you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound

Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you

[Chorus]
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs
But they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss

[Post-Chorus]
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

[Verse 2]
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still, it's making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you is a nightmare, baby, and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more

""Noll... ett, två, tre""

He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on, the usual way, he's such a clever guy
Then I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

[Verse 2]
He's dressed in the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does, and me I get so tired
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

[Chorus]
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry?

Cold as a stone
No more pain where there was pain before

Changing, moving in a circle
I can see your face in all of my dreams
Smiling, laughing from the shadows
When I hear your voice I know what it means
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try
You're all the reason for my life

[Chorus]
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down?
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have

[Verse 2]
Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd?
Thinking, wondering, what you're doing
I can't stop myself from crying out loud
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
But then, they'd never shared our love

[Chorus]
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down?
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have

Every day in the morning on her way to the office
You can see her as she catches a train
Just a face among a million faces
Just another woman with no name
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree
Because I know she's got a little secret
Friday evening she turns out to be

[Chorus]
Nina, pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella (Just like Cinderella)
Nina, pretty ballerina
Who'd ever think she could be this way?
This is the part that she likes to play
But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day

[Verse 2]
So she's back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
In an almost never-ending stream
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain
Everybody seems to think she's a bore
But they wouldn't know her little secret
What her Friday night would have in store

Sitting in the darkest corner
In the tender light I saw her face
She was looking so sad and lonely
Someone help me, someone save me
I could see the look she gave me, oh
Oh yeah, and there was one thing only
That I knew I could do

[Chorus]
Let's go, girl
It's a beautiful place this world
Come on, baby, let's dance
To the rock 'n' roll band
Let's go now
Let me show you that I know how
Come on, baby, let's dance
To the rock 'n' roll band
Come on, baby, let's dance
To the rock 'n' roll band

[Verse 2]
You'd been sitting there for hours
Trying to hide behind the flowers now
Baby, we could have fun together
Come on, cheer up, let's get started
No use being broken-hearted now
Oh yeah, you're gonna feel much better

Det som lockat mig frestar inte, nej, som det borde

Tell him how it moves along
Then he'll start to play it

He knows all from Bach to Liszt

Kolossalt beroende av stöd
Det känns trist ibland att man bara blivit en man

I bräcklig båt på livets strida älv
Du stöder dig på kvinnan som tycker synd om dig
Ja nästan lika mycket som du själv

The sound so ominously tearing through the silence

Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building

And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace

He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind

Exert that will of your own

Now we'd better hurry""

So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day

[Pre-Chorus]
Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep, the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)

[Chorus]
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)

[Chorus]
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

[Outro]
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when the day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak1Embed"

They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

[Chorus]
One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

[Verse 2]
I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

[Pre-Chorus]
That's how I started the show, one of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

He had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages
But they had nothing to say (Nothing to say)
At least not until the day (Till that day)
When something special he read
This is what it said

[Chorus]
""If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you (If you are dreaming of someone that could be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one (Why don't you call us and you'll get two)
We're the answer if you feel blue (We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with we two)
So call us and get two for the price of one (Why don't you call us and you'll get two)""

[Verse 2]
He called the number and a voice said, ""Alice Whiting""
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said, ""I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat (Meet for a chat)
The three of us in my flat? (In my flat)
I can't forget what I read""

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

[Pre-Chorus]
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

[Chorus]
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

[Verse 2]
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

[Verse 2]
Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

""Noll... ett, två, tre""

[Verse 1]
He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on, the usual way, he's such a clever guy
Then I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

[Verse 2]
He's dressed in the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does, and me I get so tired
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

[Chorus]
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry?

Cold as a stone
No more pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry

And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose a lot
Come, make your own contribution to this melting pot

Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed
Pity, Cassandra, that no one believed you
But, then again, you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

[Chorus]
Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

[Verse 2]
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply ,still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain

Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

[Verse 2]
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell

I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

[Verse 2: Agnetha]
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

[Vocalisations: Frida]
You might also like[Verse 3: Agnetha]
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

[Outro: Agnetha]
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

""Ett, två... ett, två, tre...""

[Verse: Björn]
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Like a diamond glittering in the sky
Seems to me you shine your light
Down to me to say goodnight
Twinkle twinkle, my old friend
Sleep is waiting round the bend
While you travel through the Milky Way
From afar
Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star

Another Morning Without You

[Verse: Frida]
Raindrops on a windowpane
Stillness of a summer rain
Silently the haze drifts through the trees
Slowly dawn is breaking through
Yet a morning without you
Curtains rustling in the breeze
I'm still trapped within my dreams
Daylight makes its way into my mind
Coming through
Yet another morning without you

You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car
Ah-ha-ha
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far
Ah-ha-ha
They say that money's got a magic touch
But not to me, it doesn't mean that much
You won't have me tonight
Alright, alright, alright, alright

[Chorus]
So long, see you, honey
You can't buy me with your money
Tracey, Daisy, they may be crazy
But I'll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
So long, so long, so long

[Verse 2]
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
Ah-ha-ha
I wouldn't keep a thing from you, I gave them all away
Ah-ha-ha
The girls might fall for everything you've got
But I'm not one of them, you know I'm not
You won't have me tonight

I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S

When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?

You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood

There's a fire within my soul

One more look and I forget everything, whoa

My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?

Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

[Verse 2]
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long

Don't you know that they mean so much?
Sweet, sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender

Oh bang, a boome-boomerang

You'll get love in return
So bang, a boome-boomerang is love

Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night

Are you sure you wanna hear more?
What if I ain't worth the while
Not the style you'd be looking for?
If I'm sweet tonight
Things look different in the morning light
I'm jealous and I'm proud
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

[Verse 2]
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door?
Don't you realise
I may be an angel in disguise
It's lonely to be free
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

[Bridge]
I don't believe in fairy tales
Sweet nothings in my ear
But I do believe in sympathy
That's me, you see
You might also like[Verse 3]
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Won't you have a drink with me
Just to see you're not really sore?
I can't help my ways
I'm just not the girl to hide my face
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me, mhm
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

[Interlude]

[Outro]
There's a special love
Like an eagle flying with a dove
I'll find it in the end
If I keep on searching, but until then
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me1Embed"

I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table
Though I would have liked to begin
So much that I wanna say, but I feel unable
You leave and slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless

[Chorus]

Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

[Verse 2]
Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying

[Chorus]
One man, one woman

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong

I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

[Chorus: Agnetha, Björn, Benny & Frida]
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo

Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Verse 2]
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you broken and fettered
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you

There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child

Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 1]
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""

[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own

Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

No one to hear my prayer

Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win

I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)

The likes of me abide (We abide)

Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)

The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive

I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone""

[Chorus]
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone

[Verse 3]
Over in the corner, I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, ""If you're going somewhere can I come along?""
I said, ""Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone""

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

[Chorus]
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine

Now it's different, I want you to know

In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

Wishing she had never left at all

I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

Here's to us, one more toast, and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside, both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Verse 2]
In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run

You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day

Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""

I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

[Verse 2: Agnetha]
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go

There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

[Verse 2]
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

[Verse 1: Frida]
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)

[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Benny & Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be all right
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus 1]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)
You might also like[Verse 3]
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

[Chorus 3]
The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
[Bridge]
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

[Outro]
(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)

I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone""

Till the night is gone

Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone

[Verse 3]
Over in the corner, I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

How the brave new world arrives

Did its best to please us
And strolling down the Élysées
We had a drink in each café
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa

It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

[Verse 2]
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power

We could laugh and play

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 3]
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me11Embed"

I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table
Though I would have liked to begin
So much that I wanna say, but I feel unable
You leave and slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless

[Chorus]
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

[Verse 2]
Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying

[Chorus]
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

[Verse 3]
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up
The sound of the key in the door
You smile and I realise that we need a shake-up
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing

[Chorus]
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown

Like a doll, like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk, how to walk, how to fall

[Verse 3: Agnetha & Frida]
Can't complain, I've got no-one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control, lost my hold, it's insane

They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

[Verse 2]
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

[Pre-Chorus]
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

[Chorus]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

[Verse 3]
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything

There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high

I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?

Se dice que el ansioso esconde un alma en paz
Viajero o misionero, va lejos mucho más
Si miro hasta el cielo, o dentro mío, no sé
Ya nada importa mucho
Si puedo, con sinceridad, saber que lo intenté

Como el mar y su creciente
Va la gente al andar
Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la mañana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento
Y lo hago al andar

Viajé por tantos lados en la imaginación
Estamos siempre andando, sin tiempo ni razón
¿Quién sabe las respuestas, quién puede elegir?
Si existen diferencias
Sabemos que hay, en cada ser, deseos de vivir

Nearly petrified 'cause he was

Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)

As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven

Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

So go away, God bless you

Still my one and only

Tell me, is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through

So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why

But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw 'em away
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

[Verso 1]
¿Puedes escuchar, Fernando?
Me recuerda tiempo atrás, estrellas y una noche allá
En la lumbre azul, Fernando
Tarareabas tu canción con ese suave guitarrear
Yo podía escuchar esos tambores con un sordo redoblar

[Verso 2]
Se acercaban más, Fernando
Y el momento que pasaba parecía eternidad
Y sentí temor, Fernando
Por la vida y juventud, nadie pensaba en morir
Y no siento hoy vergüenza al confesar que tuve ganas de llorar

[Estribillo]
Algo había alrededor, quizá, de claridad, Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos, en protección, Fernando
No pensábamos jamás perder ni echar atrás
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando

[Verso 3]
La vejez llegó, Fernando
Y con ella, una paz que hoy logramos disfrutar
Se durmió el tambor, Fernando
Pareciera que fue ayer que lo vivimos tú y yo
Y en tus ojos veo aún aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor

Con un rock muy violento, largas a bailar

Varför sörjer du Fernando?

År det kärleken Fernando
Har hon lämnat dej din stora, stora kärlek är det så?
Den som älskat och förlorat vet att sånt kan ändå hända då och då

[Vers 2]
Sorgen kan va tung att bära
Men att vänner sviker är nånting man måste lära sej
Jag har också mist min kära
Vem är du som tror att detta kunde drabba bara dej
Har du några glada sånger kvar så spela, spela, spela dom för mej

Länge, länge leve kärleken

Fyll ditt glas och höj en skål för den

And they must have thought they dreamed

They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was

Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)

As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

I was in a trance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)

He was trying to explain the laws of geometry

No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn & Benny]
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

[Verse 2: Frida & Agnetha]
Memories, good days, bad days (Memories, good days, bad days)
They'll be with me always (They'll be with me always)
In these old familiar rooms, children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn & Benny]
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)

Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door?

When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

[Verse 2: Björn]
Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw 'em away
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?

In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

[Verso 1]
¿Puedes escuchar, Fernando?
Me recuerda tiempo atrás, estrellas y una noche allá
En la lumbre azul, Fernando
Tarareabas tu canción con ese suave guitarrear
Yo podía escuchar esos tambores con un sordo redoblar

[Verso 2]
Se acercaban más, Fernando
Y el momento que pasaba parecía eternidad
Y sentí temor, Fernando
Por la vida y juventud, nadie pensaba en morir
Y no siento hoy vergüenza al confesar que tuve ganas de llorar

[Estribillo]
Algo había alrededor, quizá, de claridad, Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos, en protección, Fernando
No pensábamos jamás perder ni echar atrás
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando

[Verso 3]
La vejez llegó, Fernando
Y con ella, una paz que hoy logramos disfrutar
Se durmió el tambor, Fernando
Pareciera que fue ayer que lo vivimos tú y yo
Y en tus ojos veo aún aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor

Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?

Day is dawning and I must go
You're asleep, but still, I'm sure you'll know
Why it had to end this way
You and I had a groovy time
But I told you somewhere down the line
You would have to find me gone
I just have to move along

Waiting in the morning rain
Lord, give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

When you wake I know you'll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
For a no-good bum like me

Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd?
Thinking, wondering, what you're doing
I can't stop myself from crying out loud
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
But then, they'd never shared our love

But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day

So she's back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
In an almost never-ending stream
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain

I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Ah...

[Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
""Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help some day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road that we're going
(On the road)
We all need words of comfort and compassion
(We all need)
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him, that's the only way""

[Verse 2: Agnetha & Frida]
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying

That the true ""Miss Nobody"" is me
It's an evil world that has only made me a girl

It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he says he loves you, and life has just begun
It's so much more than any words can say

War das alles eine Täuschung bloß?
Und du läßt mich nun allein
Und nun stürzt der Himmel ein

War das etwa die Endstation
Und ich merkte einfach nichts davon
Hab' ich mich denn so geirrt?
Was zu tun war hab ich getan
Jetzt kommt es auf and're Dinge an

Hey, what's it good for anyway?""

What about all those men

Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?
What about Livingstone?

Didn't know what to answer or what to say

But you'd better

So get off our playground and stay away

Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

[Verse 2]
You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

[Chorus]
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone

[Verse 3]
Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, ""If you're going somewhere can I come along?""
I said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

[Verse 5]
Standing up is scary if you think you're gonna fall
Like a Humpty-Dumpty 'fraid of falling off your wall
I say if you ever wanna know what's going on
Gotta keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone

Saddle your horse my dear
And ride off into the sunset

You stand before me
Oh, you think our life is a movie
My world is real I live and feel
And I can do without you

Put on your white sombrero
Your red bandanna too
Think of this day as a showdown
Goodbye my friend, this is the end
For me and you

[Verse 4]
Now be a bold vaquero
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing
Into the night, all dressed in white
Unchained and free, without me

Put on your white sombrero
Like all the cowboys do
Go find a sweet señorita
Somebody meek, who'll never speak
Harshly to you

You're such a caballero
Proud, never bending
I want someone who will take me
Just as I am, I need a man
Who is in rhyme with his time

Coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size
And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified
Welcome to me, here I am, my arms are open wide

[Verse 2: Frida & Agnetha]
Somewhere in the middle of the never-ending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets
People come and take their chances
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose a lot
Come, make your own contribution to this melting pot

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha]
I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells and the turmoil of cars
And the people, the air that you're breathing is me
Yes, I am the city, you let me be

People feed me with their lives, I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind, if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha]
I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells and the turmoil of cars
And the people, the parks and the squares that you see
All the sounds that you hear and the air that you're breathing is me
Yes, I am the city, you let me be

[Bridge: Agnetha]

In a while and you smile and say hello
Then we'll be dancing through the night

Part 2

[Verse: Agnetha & Frida]
When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold then I think of us, of you and I
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears and I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake

[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees
The rain fell softly on your face
Oh, I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
The rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

[Spoken Outro: Michael B. Tretow, Björn & Agnetha]
""Det räcker där.""
""Ja.""
""Nu hör jag så alltså väldigt lite Frida!""
Free as a Bumble Bee

[Verse: Björn]
I'm down and I feel depressed
Sitting here just waiting for next bus travelling downtown
It's a crying shame, isn't it?
The beautiful weather
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be

[Chorus: Björn]
As free as a bumble bee
Take a sip from every flower
Free as a bumble bee
While away each lazy hour

[Post-Chorus: Björn]
What a good life, lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life, living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

Rubber Ball Man

[Verse: Frida]
The poster on the wall of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free
The hero of them all, you're a legend
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you
Still you're close as can be

[Chorus: Frida]
Make the bandstand to a dreamland, rubber ball man
Clapping your hands, let your feet dance, rubber ball man
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still
Some of us dreaming, some of us screaming
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man

[Post-Chorus: Frida]
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man

Crying Over You

[Verse: Björn]
I'm waiting for you baby, I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you, it chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me, but now I know it's true
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you

I'm waiting for you baby, I'm sitting all alone

He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart

Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes

[Chorus: Agnetha]
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone

As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

And it's rubbing off on me, I feel it too

And I'm feeling so alone

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

[Verse 1: Frida]
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)

[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Benny & Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only
(Still, I'm thinking about you only)

[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be all right
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Benny & Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

[Bridge: Frida]
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Benny & Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me

I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus 1]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)
You might also like[Verse 3]
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

[Chorus 3]
The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
[Bridge]
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

[Outro]
(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)
(Has to fall)
(It seems plain)
(Why complain)18Embed"

I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone""

[Chorus]

Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone

[Verse 3]
Over in the corner, I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?

He said, ""If you're going somewhere can I come along?""
I said, ""Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone""

There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad

Part of me is acting while the other stands beside
Yes, I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde

And the fireworks are through

And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor

In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine

Did its best to please us
And strolling down the Élysées
We had a drink in each café
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa

[Pre-Chorus]
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

[Chorus]
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

[Verse 2]
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power

Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry

How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 3]
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me11Embed"

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

[Verse 2]
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Did you see that man in the limousine?
With the pretty girl, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill

[Verse 2]
Did you see that man with a fat cigar?
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
While the rest of us drink a beer

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle

[Post-Chorus]
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle...

But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy an honest friend

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle

Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much?
Sweet, sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender

[Chorus]
Like a bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boome-boomerang is love
A boome-boomerang is love

[Verse 2]
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing

[Verso 1]
Yo por ti me engañé, hace tiempo lo sé
Y ya lo decidí, ahora te dejaré
Mírame bien; ¿cuándo aprenderé?
No sé por qué vivo tanto esta gran pasión
Que me quema el corazón

[Prestribillo]
Si me miras, siento tanto placer
Si te acercas, creo desvanecer, woah

[Estribillo]
Mamma mia, una y otra vez
No sé cómo resistirte
Mamma mia, quiero y tú lo ves
No sé cómo evadirte

Tú que me has provocado
Luego me has rechazado
¿Por qué te sigo queriendo así?

Mamma mia, ya lo decidí
Porque no puedo vivir sin ti

They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

[Verse 2]
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

[Pre-Chorus]
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

[Chorus]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

[Verse 3]
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything

No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table
Though I would have liked to begin
So much that I wanna say, but I feel unable
You leave and slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless

[Chorus]
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

[Verse 2]
Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying

[Chorus]
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again

And it's never too late for changing

Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself
I've always tried""

How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on

And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why

You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, way down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst (And when you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed (And you've got it sad)
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose

[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
It's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul

My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool
But on all weekends (Together again)
When I meet my friends (I'm gonna see them now)
And we're looking 'round for the action, we sure play it cool

I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing

Never expecting surprises

Yes, I will take it, it can't go wrong

Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed

Estamos siempre andando, sin tiempo ni razón

Sabemos que hay, en cada ser, deseos de vivir

Though it's hurting me, now it's history

And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)

At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Verse 2]
My, my
I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

(A Man After Midnight) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

[Verse 2]
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

And I sit all alone impatiently

So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?

Was it me or was it you?

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
""Bye-bye"", leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
""Bye-bye"" doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 3]
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion

I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty

Without a song or a dance, what are we?

No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

[Chorus]
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine

I was sitting by the phone

Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

[Verse 2]
You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

Now look at that guy, he's making me cry
He leaves every morning and he hardly says goodbye

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 1]
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad?
And still, there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad

In my dreams, I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball

Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong

Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give

Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach

Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Verse 2]
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you broken and fettered
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
(You and I, we know)
(How all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancing once again
(You’ll be dancing once again)
And the pain will end
(And all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)

There's that look in your eyes

Ah, but girl, you're only a child

Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 1]
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""

[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

How I hate to spend the evening on my own

Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

No one to hear my prayer

Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win

I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus 1]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)
You might also like[Verse 3]
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

[Chorus 3]
The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
[Bridge]
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

[Outro]
(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)
(Has to fall)
(It seems plain)
(Why complain)18Embed"

I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone""

He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion

Now it's different, I want you to know

In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

Here's to us, one more toast, and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside, both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Verse 2]
In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run

I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

[Chorus]
Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""

And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now

We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

[Vocalisations: Frida]

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

[Outro: Agnetha]
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be

[Chorus]
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

[Verse 2]
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell

I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?

[Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Giving
Love is a reason for living
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)

I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

[Verse 2]
You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

[Verse 2]
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night

Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen

Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud

Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door?

When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher

They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was

When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

[Chorus]
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

[Verse 3]
I was in a trance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)

He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher

Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii

[Chorus]
After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (Making no plans, ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance

[Verse 2]
Guess I've been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's so exciting, why should I pretend?
In a few hours, the plane will descend
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii

Never expecting surprises

Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed

And they've found new horizons

And I dream I can spread my wings

Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Verse 2]
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you broken and fettered
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
(You and I, we know)
(How all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancing once again
(You’ll be dancing once again)
And the pain will end
(And all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)

I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha]
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

[Verse 2: Frida & Agnetha]
How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha]
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

Maybe even when you're not there

Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you

There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child

Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 1]
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""

[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

[Verse 2]
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in

I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus 1]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)

But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

[Verse 1: Frida]
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)

[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Benny & Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be all right
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone""

So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star

The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right, the Paris night
Did its best to please us
And strolling down the Élysées
We had a drink in each café
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa

[Pre-Chorus]
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

[Chorus]
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

[Verse 2]
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power

But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry

How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly

Help me

And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on, the usual way, he's such a clever guy
Then I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

He's dressed in the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does, and me I get so tired
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)

Halfway up to the moon

Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry?

I have a very good friend

And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world

Here's to us, one more toast, and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside, both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Verse 2]
In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

[Verse 2]
Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

And my twilight images go by

I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

[Verse 2: Agnetha]
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

[Vocalisations: Frida]

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

[Outro: Agnetha]
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed
Pity, Cassandra, that no one believed you
But, then again, you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

[Chorus]
Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

[Verse 2]
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply ,still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

[Verse 3]
I watched the ship leaving harbour at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep

I was up with the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cause I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before

[Chorus]
And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

[Verse 2]
As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

[Bridge]
Baby, how could you do it?
You just told me lies
And you meet behind my back with other guys
Baby, how could you tell me
There was only me?
I was stupid to believe you, I was blind but now I see

[Verse 3]
Then you smiled and you took my hand
""There is something,"" you said, ""that you may not know
There's a couple of men in my life
And one of them is my brother Joe
He's been gone for a long, long time
But he's back and I think he's going to stay
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way""

[Chorus]
And I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
Then I realised
It's a crazy world
So I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

Never leave me, girl

Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii

After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (Making no plans, ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance

Guess I've been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret

End of night, a new day dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on a beach

[Hook: Björn and Agentha, Björn, Benny & Frida]

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park

I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong

Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha]
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

[Verse 2: Frida & Agnetha]
How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha]
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there

Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

[Verse 2]
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music for giving it to me
You might also like[Bridge]
I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance

[Chorus]
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

I was a loser then, but I'm a winner now

How everything in life comes down to this at last

Gently from day to day, memories will fade away
Yes, I'm still alive, the agony is gone
And my mind is slowly waking
And my heart has ceased its aching

I took so many blows, I cried a sea of tears
I took so many blows
And only heaven knows how I could stand the fear
And only heaven knows
I think of all the nights I lay alone and scared
All shattered and crying and thinking I was dying

He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on, the usual way, he's such a clever guy
Then I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

[Verse 2]
He's dressed in the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does, and me I get so tired
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

[Chorus]
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry?

Cold as a stone
No more pain where there was pain before

I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

[Verse 2: Agnetha]
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim

I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain

Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed
Pity, Cassandra, that no one believed you
But, then again, you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

[Chorus]
Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

[Verse 2]
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply ,still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

[Verse 3]
I watched the ship leaving harbour at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain

[Chorus]
Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be

[Chorus]
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

[Verse 2]
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I won't know how

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

[Outro]
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart

Just a Notion

[Chorus: Björn, Agnetha & Frida]
Just a notion, that's all
Just a feeling that you're watching me
Every move I'm making
Am I reading your mind?
'Cause it's almost like you're touching me
There is no mistaking
[Verse 1: Agnetha & Frida]
Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me
In a while and you smile and say hello
Then we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on must be right

[Verse 2: Agnetha & Frida]
Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
If it's our destiny there's nothing we can do
But tonight is very special
It's the night for me and you

Burning my bridges, cutting my tie
Once again I wanna look into the eye
Being myself, counting my pride

Gonna have peace now, you can be free
No one here will make a sucker out of me

Hamlet III, Parts 1 & 2
Part 1

[Instrumental]

Part 2

[Verse: Agnetha & Frida]
When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold then I think of us, of you and I
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears and I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake

[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees
The rain fell softly on your face
Oh, I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
The rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

[Spoken Outro: Michael B. Tretow, Björn & Agnetha]
""Det räcker där.""
""Ja.""
""Nu hör jag så alltså väldigt lite Frida!""
Free as a Bumble Bee

[Verse: Björn]
I'm down and I feel depressed
Sitting here just waiting for next bus travelling downtown
It's a crying shame, isn't it?
The beautiful weather
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be

[Chorus: Björn]
As free as a bumble bee
Take a sip from every flower
Free as a bumble bee
While away each lazy hour

[Post-Chorus: Björn]
What a good life, lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life, living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

Rubber Ball Man

[Verse: Frida]
The poster on the wall of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free
The hero of them all, you're a legend
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you
Still you're close as can be

[Chorus: Frida]
Make the bandstand to a dreamland, rubber ball man
Clapping your hands, let your feet dance, rubber ball man
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still
Some of us dreaming, some of us screaming
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man

[Post-Chorus: Frida]
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man

Crying Over You

[Verse: Björn]
I'm waiting for you baby, I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you, it chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me, but now I know it's true
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you

[Verse: Björn]
I'm waiting for you baby, I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you, it chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me, but now I know it's true
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you

[Outro: Björn]
Crying over you
I'm crying over you
Crying over little memories of things we used to do
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you

Just Like That

[Spoken Intro: Björn & Benny]
Härligt!
Ett-två. Då kör vi då. Går bandet? Ett-två ett-två-tre...

[Verse 1: Agnetha]
Just like that
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart

[Verse 2: Agnetha]
Just like that
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes

[Chorus: Agnetha]
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone

[Verse 3: Agnetha]
Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

[Saxophone Solo: Raphael Ravenscroft]

[Verse 4: Agnetha]
Just like that
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart

[Verse 5: Agnetha]
Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
Just like that
Giving a Little Bit More

[Verse: Björn]
There's a gentleness to everything you do
And it's rubbing off on me, I feel it too
I've been waiting, but my loneliness I get

[Pre-Chorus: Björn]
When you call me on the phone
And I'm feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over, baby, you know I will
I could never stay on my own

[Chorus: Björn]
Giving it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always giving a little more
When I'm with you
Giving it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always giving a little more
When I'm with you
I'm always giving a little more
When I'm with you

[Chorus: Björn]
Giving it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always giving a little more
When I'm with you
Giving it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always giving a little more

Until that day
My life had been a river following
A safe, predestinated course
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising force
My strongholds broke down all too easily
I remember well
How it did embarrass me
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style

[Chorus]
Just like that
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home
In my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

And once again
The river's flowing slowly
Following its safe and uneventful course
Now the tears have dried
It's become a pleasant break
I recall without remorse
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit
He had something that I miss
I guess he was a rolling stone
The only one I've known

[Chorus]
Just like that
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home
In my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 1]
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""

[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

Keep thinking, had to pay the price

I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

[Verse 2: Agnetha]
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

[Vocalisations: Frida]

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

[Outro: Agnetha]
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

[Verse 2]
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

And they don't dare to come here

And you

And I smiled like Mona Lisa

It was a fine and true romance

I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes

Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?

This park and these houses, old streets I have walked
Everything dear, will it be here
One day when I am returning?
My friends will get married, have children and homes
It sounds so nice, well-planned and wise
Never expecting surprises

[Chorus]
I wonder, it's frightening
Leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I don't even try?
I'm not a coward, oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes, I will take it, it can't go wrong

[Verse 2]
My friends and my family, this dull little town
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar

[Chorus]
I wonder, it's frightening
Leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, oh, it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I don't even try?

I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha]
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there

Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight

I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

[Chorus]
Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Everybody screamed
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher

They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was

Taken by surprise (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

[Chorus]
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

[Verse 3]
I was in a trance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher

And you feel a strange attraction

Come, make your own contribution to this melting pot

Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed
Pity, Cassandra, that no one believed you
But, then again, you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

[Chorus]
Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

[Verse 2]
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply ,still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart

Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no

Deep inside, both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Verse 2]
In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Interlude]

It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more

With nothing left untried

[Verso 1]
¿Puedes escuchar, Fernando?
Me recuerda tiempo atrás, estrellas y una noche allá
En la lumbre azul, Fernando
Tarareabas tu canción con ese suave guitarrear
Yo podía escuchar esos tambores con un sordo redoblar

[Verso 2]
Se acercaban más, Fernando
Y el momento que pasaba parecía eternidad
Y sentí temor, Fernando
Por la vida y juventud, nadie pensaba en morir
Y no siento hoy vergüenza al confesar que tuve ganas de llorar

[Estribillo]
Algo había alrededor, quizá, de claridad, Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos, en protección, Fernando
No pensábamos jamás perder ni echar atrás
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando

[Verso 3]
La vejez llegó, Fernando
Y con ella, una paz que hoy logramos disfrutar
Se durmió el tambor, Fernando
Pareciera que fue ayer que lo vivimos tú y yo

Se dice que el ansioso esconde un alma en paz
Viajero o misionero, va lejos mucho más
Si miro hasta el cielo, o dentro mío, no sé
Ya nada importa mucho
Si puedo, con sinceridad, saber que lo intenté

Va la gente al andar
Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la mañana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento
Y lo hago al andar

[Verso 2: Agnetha]
Viajé por tantos lados en la imaginación
Estamos siempre andando, sin tiempo ni razón
¿Quién sabe las respuestas, quién puede elegir?
Si existen diferencias
Sabemos que hay, en cada ser, deseos de vivir

Ya no hay más sonrisas
Todo finaliza
Nuestra casa hoy vacía, me hace llorar
Y la historia aquí termina, hay que olvidar

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn]
Solo tú, sola yo, aha
Poco y nada se logró
Solo tú, sola yo, aha
Nuestro amor quién puede negar, pasó
(Negar pasó se termino, pasó se termino, se termino)
Separarse es tan difícil lo sé, pero yo me iré
(Pero yo me, difícil lo sé, pero yo me iré)
Conociéndome a mí, conociéndote a ti

[Verse 2: Frida & Agnetha]
Bueno, malo, tanto (Bueno, malo, tanto)
Guardo, risas, llanto (Guardo, risas, llanto)
En los cuartos donde vimos, niños jugar
Hoy hay sólo un gran silencio, en el lugar

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

[Verse 2]
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Mamma mia, even if I say
""Bye-bye"", leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
""Bye-bye"" doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

Beside the victory
That's her destiny

Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The loser has to fall (Has to fall)

Why should I complain? (Why complain)

The likes of me abide (We abide)

Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Verse 2]
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you broken and fettered
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
(You and I, we know)
(How all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancing once again
(You’ll be dancing once again)
And the pain will end
(And all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grieving

But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

[Verse 2]
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus 1]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)

But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

[Chorus 3]
The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

With a bit of rock music, everything is fine

In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you broken and fettered

I hope we can patch it up together

How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving

And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving

But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you

I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret

Summer night city
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

[Verse 1: Agnetha & Frida]
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong

[Pre-Chorus: Björn, Agnetha, Benny & Frida]
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

[Chorus: Agnetha, Björn, Benny & Frida]
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live

Somehow something turns me on

I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction

It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach

Where are those happy days? They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

[Chorus]
So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?

[Verse 2]
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood
What happened to our love? It used to be so good

There's a fire within my soul

Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door

No, I can't let go

If you got no place to go when you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown

If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me

And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness; still another mile

Ah, but girl, you're only a child

Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Better slow down, girl

Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow

How I hate to see you like this

I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth

You were always sure of yourself
Now, I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together

How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again

'til that day
When something special he read

In my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?

Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Find the end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win

And I gaze into the night

I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

[Pre-Chorus: Agnetha, Agnetha & Frida]
I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?

[Post-Chorus: Frida]
Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

[Bridge: Frida]
And you make me talk
Doo-doo, doo-doo
And you make me feel
Doo-doo, doo-doo
And you make me show
Doo-doo, doo-doo
What I'm trying to conceal
Doo-doo, doo-doo
If I trust in you
Doo-doo, doo-doo
Would you let me down?
Doo-doo, doo-doo
Would you laugh at me
Doo-doo, doo-doo
If I said I care for you?
Ah-ah

Eagle

[Verse 1: Agnetha & Frida]
They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
[Verse 2: Agnetha & Frida]
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

[Pre-Chorus 1: Agnetha & Frida]
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

[Verse 3: Agnetha & Frida]
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything

[Verse 4: Agnetha & Frida]
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
[Pre-Chorus 2: Agnetha & Frida]
Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly

I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone

[Verse 3]
Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where are those happy days? They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

[Chorus]
So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?

[Verse 2]
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood
What happened to our love? It used to be so good

[Chorus]
So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?

Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

[Verse 2]
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret

Having the time of your life

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Verse 2]
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you broken and fettered
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
(You and I, we know)
(How all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancing once again
(You’ll be dancing once again)
And the pain will end
(And all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)

You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child

[Chorus]
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

[Post-Chorus]
Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow

Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

[Verse 2]
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus 1]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)

Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

[Verse 2]
I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

[Verse 2: Agnetha]
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

[Vocalisations: Frida]

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

[Outro: Agnetha]
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be

[Chorus]
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

[Verse 2]
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell

Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting

I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

[Chorus]
Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""

Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Verse 2]
In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done

Carry my soul away into the world

He had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages
But they had nothing to say (Nothing to say)
At least not until the day (Till that day)
When something special he read
This is what it said

[Chorus]
""If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you (If you are dreaming of someone that could be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one (Why don't you call us and you'll get two)
We're the answer if you feel blue (We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with we two)
So call us and get two for the price of one (Why don't you call us and you'll get two)""

He called the number and a voice said, ""Alice Whiting""
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said, ""I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling

Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one

Then call us and get two for the price of one (Why don't you call us and you'll get two)

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

[Pre-Chorus]
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

[Chorus]
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

[Verse 2]
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go?
(Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

[Chorus]
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile9Embed"

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

[Verse 2]
Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

[Outro]
I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon

Det en bonnläpp. Det svängde om
Släpa och slet och snodde
Och sen så småningom
På dur och moll
Blev han rikare än ett troll
Nu är hans dagar fyllda
Utav tunga beslut
Lukas ska ut
Baken ska saltas
Korven ska kokas
Lukas ska ut

Hovas vittne
Knarllarnas röst
Västergötlands stämma på Jorden
Sångar hjärta klappar i ditt bröst
Pennan glöder. Upp flyga orden
Raska klackar slå ännu
Som ett jehu är du
Hovas vittne ger alrig upp
Hovas vittne
Full fart framåt. Flaggan i topp

Hos dig på fest
När man sitter och trivs som mest
Hör man någonting som surrar
En dammsugare protest
Från den Parnasse
Tar du flyget is första klass
Djurgården-Honolulu
Om du komma fram
Englit program
Med ditt bagage i Rom
Och Gudrun i Amsterdam

Och tivedsflikan säll
Har vandrat ut från mörka skogen
Åt alla hörn och håll
Det gått som en paroll
På lördag är det dans på logen
Och med en tacksam smäll
Att det är lördagskväll
Slår kolaren igen sin koja
För när som det är dans
I trakten någonstans
Då vill han vara med och skoja

Där vi i skog och dal
Sällan skådar kvinnlig fägring
Där uti kojan sval
Hamo låter som en hägring
Mennu uti vi chansen har
Att å minnen med tillbaka
Bra att ad vid långa gråa dar
Som tröst för det vi får försaka

Hör raska klackar slår
När tivedshambo går
Har Fridas Verner blivit galen
Här sprätter tivedsbor
I hambodansens klor
Och Verner jagar landsfiskalen
Jag blir det gräl och kiv
Så avgörs det med kniv
För här är rena Vilda Västern
Till vardag och till fest
Är rapesnuset bäst
Kom hit så bär vi bort orkestern

Vi slåss på samma gång
Och river sönder våra kläder
Och har man inga kvar
Man år med rumpan bar
Och tror på fortsatt vackert väder
Vi kastar inte pil
Vi har en anna stil
Som mera lutar åt det vilda
Jag her väl ändå rätt
Att slåss på min biljett
När dom ger ögonkast åt Hilda

Då kan det hända att
Tivedsblodet svallar över
Då åker rock hatt
Utifall ni stryk behöver
Vana vid släp och slit
Kojarliv och tivedskogar
Står vårt mod och våran fasta lit
Till styrkan och till våra knogar

Hör raska klackar slår
