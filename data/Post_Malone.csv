I'm a rolling stone
It took you by surprise
You're hangin' onto something, anything
Just like a shimmer of light
Oh, how the sword, it fell
I said, ""You're really something, everything
To me, and I'm cold
So hold me closer, baby""

[Chorus]
I don't understand why you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself
I don't understand why you like me so much
Wish I was someone else
You say you got a million reasons
But I can't think of one
I don't understand why you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
I'll build a church for you
They'll come from miles around
Girl, you're really somеthing, everything
To me, and I'm cold
So hold mе closer, baby

Wanna thank young me for gettin' me fucked up

The way I gotta flex, you'd think I did Pilates
I call my quote-unquote friends, ""Do you got plans?""
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is
Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After thirty High Noons, it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot
Bye-bye (Damn)

I'm a rolling stone
It took you by surprise
You're hangin' onto something, anything
Just like a shimmer of light
Oh, how the sword, it fell
I said, ""You're really something, everything
To me, and I'm cold
So hold me closer, baby""

[Chorus]
I don't understand why you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself
I don't understand why you like me so much
Wish I was someone else
You say you got a million reasons
But I can't think of one
I don't understand why you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
I'll build a church for you
They'll come from miles around
Girl, you're really somеthing, everything
To me, and I'm cold
So hold mе closer, baby

So tell me, how the fuck am I still alive? It's a miracle, oh

Wanna thank young me for gettin' me fucked up

Threw my bottle at the sky, said, ""God, that's a warning""

I just left Wally's, spent a Maserati
The way I gotta flex, you'd think I did Pilates
I call my quote-unquote friends, ""Do you got plans?""
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is
Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After thirty High Noons, it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot
Bye-bye (Damn)

When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke

Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain

And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge

Oh

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'

Ooh, I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough (Yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (Yeah)
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (Yeah)
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (Yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi

When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, ""¡No más!"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, ""Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?"" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)

Take my own life just to save yours
Drink it all down just to throw it up
Take my own life just to save yours (Just to save yours)
Take my own life just to save yours
I got a reputation that I can't deny
You're the superstar, entertain us (Entertain us)

[Bridge]
Entertain us, but please, don't wake me up
I betrayed us, but us don't give a fuck
Kill myself today, kill it all away
Broken path I made
Please, just stay away

[Verse 1]
I know I fucked up before, but I won't do it again
And I got a lot of things that I wish I would've said
And I'm the same damn fool, and I'm wearin' that hat again
I know I fucked up and I can't make it right

[Verse 2]
Watch yourself, I can't slow down
This is who I am, can't be anyonе else, so
Don't let mе go, save yourself
Just save yourself, just save yourself
I was born to raise hell, I was born to take pills
I was born to chase mills, I was born to cave in
I was born to fuck hoes, I was born to fuck up
I was born, what a shame

So turn around and show me that I'm better

Look around and all I see is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told

You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth

[Verse 1]
I can’t call you right now, I been drinking
And I know that I'll say what I'm thinking
My whole life I was drawn to the deep end
When will it sink in?
Why do I tell myself that I’ll do the best I can?
I know damn well that you couldn't give a damn
Ten billion cuties that think I'm the man
But if you come around, I'll be eatin' out your hand

[Chorus]
Keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)

I woke up on the ground
I guess I shoulda kept that shit to myself
Turns out, I'm pretty good at runnin' my mouth
But not good enough (Not good enough)
You know, when I go in, it's lights out (It's lights out)
I couldn't hear a thing 'cause the song was too loud (Was too loud)
Last night I had thirty-two teeth in my mouth
Some went away
Why'd you have to go and fucking ruin my day?

[Chorus: Post Malone]
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked
But you're the only way to drown my sadness
This is my love/hate letter out to alcohol
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
I was laid out flat like a centerfold (Centerfold)
Jakey and his partner drove me home
Lookin' in the mirror, something's wrong
Lеt me get my dentist on thе phone (On the phone)
Found my keys, then I went back out
Someone asked me how it all went down
I remember like it's yesterday (Like it's yesterday)
I took a shot, took a shot, took a shot, took another shot
Fell right out my fuckin' chair, swingin' for his eye
Then a big chrome ring flew in from the side
I thought I died
Why'd you have to go and fuckin' ruin my night?

This is like the first time I bought a chain
This is like when I was sane, before the fame
Uh-oh, uh-oh, this life is crazy

I won't let another angel go to waste
Uh-oh, uh-oh, this life is crazy

Oh, Vividus bed where I'm layin' my head (Ooh)
Devil on my back, so I sleep on my chest
Waitin' at the gate, how'd they get my address?
(How'd they get my address?)
On my last nerve whilе I'm rippin' cigarettes
It's a killer I know, it's a killеr I know
I just need a lil' somethin', get me through the day
Yeah, my mind is blank or I overthink
It's gettin' old, but it's nothin' new

I'm bleedin' out, I need you now, can't let you win
I want it all, I want it all, I push so hard, I break it
My only home went down in smoke
It's bittersweet, I taste it
So, are you lonely? 'Cause I'm healin' slowly
In a moment, your memory is fading on me
Got no expectations now that I'm forsaken
Let's see what I'm made of, find out if I can take it, now

[Chorus]
When I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me, who's to blame for this?

[Verse 2]
All I wanted was a piece of decent on the side (On the side)
When we go to bed, she be creepin' on my side (On my side)
I was drinkin' all day, I let her spend the night
When I took her home, she left somethin' in my ride, in my ride (Damn)
Then my baby found out
Now I'm livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel
Ain't that bad, I got room service
Livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel

So I close my eyes and wait for a miracle
And everything done for the dead after they're dead, is for the living
And everything done on a day, goddamn it, that's our decision
I kept my eyes closed, it was easy, now I see it with perfect vision
And everything done for the dead after they're dead, is for the living

You're worse than cigarettes, you light a fire
Got me coughin' out my heart
Yeah, you're the type to try to throw my ass in jail
Just because I was alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, you ain't no angel, you know lovin' is fatal
You get off on betrayal, I guess we are the same though
We could've taken this shit all the way to Mars
If we just played our parts, but

[Chorus]
Love is fuckin' hateful, hateful
Why is it you want me dead?
Callin' me unfaithful, 'faithful
But you know who you're dealin' with
How am I supposed to lay low, lay low
When things are so beyond repair?
Love is fuckin' hateful, hateful, to say

[Verse 2]
You should know that she was just another face
I was tryna get a taste
Put yourself inside my shoes
Don't you say, ""I need you to give me space""

She told me that I'm not enough (Yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (Yeah)
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (Yeah)
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (Yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore

Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants

Couldn't fall asleep all night
I tried with all my might
I thought I knew what you want
It isn't all that nice
But I guess it will suffice
It's hard to know what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
Could you be?
A little less sour, we're rottin' by the hour
And my heart's rotten too
In every film I watch, I'm on the side of the bad guy
So turn around and show me that I'm better

[Chorus]
Some people got an apple, some people got a tangerine
Look around and all I see is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told
I guess I'm just shit outta luck, growing a lemon tree
I'm gonna burn it down, and grow me somethin' bettеr
Hey-ah, hey-ah

[Verse 2]
Blood on my hands, I'm on the fеnce, I double down
A swing and a miss, a kick in the ribs, in trouble now
Came from the dirt, back in the ground, when I die
But I'ma survive, I got my ways

You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth

[Verse 1]
I can’t call you right now, I been drinking
And I know that I'll say what I'm thinking
My whole life I was drawn to the deep end
When will it sink in?
Why do I tell myself that I’ll do the best I can?
I know damn well that you couldn't give a damn
Ten billion cuties that think I'm the man
But if you come around, I'll be eatin' out your hand

[Chorus]
Keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
I keep wondering who's thе one replacing me?
Takе me back to yesterday
When I was wrapped around your finger

So excuse me for an hour while I love myself
You told me, you'd protect my heart, you'd be my goalie
Thinkin' 'bout the bullshit that you sold me
And I know that I ain't perfect, but you so mean

Mm-mm-mm-mm

[Chorus: Post Malone]
This is like a private plane up on my ring
This is like the first time I bought a chain
This is like when I was sane, before the fame
Uh-oh, uh-oh, this life is crazy
This is like another thing I can't explain
This is like the summer flame that got away
I won't let another angel go to waste
Uh-oh, uh-oh, this life is crazy

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Oh, Vividus bed where I'm layin' my head (Ooh)
Devil on my back, so I sleep on my chest
Waitin' at the gate, how'd they get my address?
(How'd they get my address?)
On my last nerve whilе I'm rippin' cigarettes
It's a killer I know, it's a killеr I know
I just need a lil' somethin', get me through the day
Yeah, my mind is blank or I overthink
It's gettin' old, but it's nothin' new
I say your name when you're not around
When I'm drunk and my knees can't pick me up
Need to say your name when you're not around
When I'm drunk and my knees can't pick me up

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
I blacked out, left a hundred missed calls on your phone
I mixed my drink with a couple of drugs
Spit in my face, now you hate that I'm gone, babe (Gone, gone)
You're doin' the most
I don't need somebody to be the one to keep me honest
I don't wanna know the truth, I can't fight if I'm alone
I need enemies (I do, I do)
You know how far that I will go (How far)
Every road takes its toll (Toll)
Before you leave, I'm gone, I'm gone (Gone)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI with Post Malone]
This is like a private plane up on my ring (Ring)

We made a pact, you'd take me back, always, again
I'm bleedin' out, I need you now, can't let you win
I want it all, I want it all, I push so hard, I break it
My only home went down in smoke
It's bittersweet, I taste it
So, are you lonely? 'Cause I'm healin' slowly
In a moment, your memory is fading on me
Got no expectations now that I'm forsaken
Let's see what I'm made of, find out if I can take it, now

[Chorus]
When I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me, who's to blame for this?

[Verse 2]
All I wanted was a piece of decent on the side (On the side)
When we go to bed, she be creepin' on my side (On my side)
I was drinkin' all day, I let her spend the night
When I took her home, she left somethin' in my ride, in my ride (Damn)
Then my baby found out
Now I'm livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel
Ain't that bad, I got room service
Livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel

Holy fuck, I understand that I'm too weak
Oh my God, just shut me up for Heaven’s sake
So I load one 'round, I'm scared to die while I’m awake
So I close my eyes and wait for a miracle
And everything done for the dead after they're dead, is for the living
And everything done on a day, goddamn it, that's our decision
I kept my eyes closed, it was easy, now I see it with perfect vision
And everything done for the dead after they're dead, is for the living
Fuck me up, fuck it, get fucked up, hey
Fuck me up, yeah, and stay fucked up

Take my own life just to save yours

Take my own life just to save yours (Just to save yours)
Take my own life just to save yours
I got a reputation that I can't deny
You're the superstar, entertain us (Entertain us)

[Bridge]
Entertain us, but please, don't wake me up
I betrayed us, but us don't give a fuck
Kill myself today, kill it all away
Broken path I made
Please, just stay away

[Verse 1]
I know I fucked up before, but I won't do it again
And I got a lot of things that I wish I would've said
And I'm the same damn fool, and I'm wearin' that hat again
I know I fucked up and I can't make it right

[Verse 2]
Watch yourself, I can't slow down
This is who I am, can't be anyonе else, so
Don't let mе go, save yourself
Just save yourself, just save yourself
I was born to raise hell, I was born to take pills
I was born to chase mills, I was born to cave in
I was born to fuck hoes, I was born to fuck up
I was born, what a shame

So turn around and show me that I'm better

Some people got an apple, some people got a tangerine
Look around and all I see is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told
I guess I'm just shit outta luck, growing a lemon tree
I'm gonna burn it down, and grow me somethin' bettеr

You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth

[Verse 1]
I can’t call you right now, I been drinking
And I know that I'll say what I'm thinking
My whole life I was drawn to the deep end
When will it sink in?
Why do I tell myself that I’ll do the best I can?
I know damn well that you couldn't give a damn
Ten billion cuties that think I'm the man
But if you come around, I'll be eatin' out your hand

[Chorus]
Keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
I keep wondering who's thе one replacing me?
Takе me back to yesterday

Keep my Glocky tucked like a baby in a manger
When your girl around me, she treat you like a stranger
I got 20, 30 strippers in the Sprinter van
It's a little cramped to try to teach me how to dance
Ooh, you talkin' that shit, but
You ain't gonna do shit, ooh (Gonna do shit, ooh)
I ain't even gotta get up (Get it)
Ain't nobody scared of you, ooh (Damn)

[Chorus]
Take your bitch, give her back, insane (Wow)
Sent her packing, she was actin' crazy
Goin' batshit in the backseat, range
She was classy, now she nasty, hey
I'm a bachelor, I'm a bastard, hey (Wow)
Don't believe me? You can ask her, hey
Goin' batshit in the backseat, range (Wow)
She was classy, now she nasty, hey (Hey)6Embed"

I woke up on the ground
I guess I shoulda kept that shit to myself
Turns out, I'm pretty good at runnin' my mouth
But not good enough (Not good enough)
You know, when I go in, it's lights out (It's lights out)
I couldn't hear a thing 'cause the song was too loud (Was too loud)
Last night I had thirty-two teeth in my mouth
Some went away
Why'd you have to go and fucking ruin my day?

[Chorus: Post Malone]
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked
But you're the only way to drown my sadness
This is my love/hate letter out to alcohol
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
I was laid out flat like a centerfold (Centerfold)
Jakey and his partner drove me home
Lookin' in the mirror, something's wrong
Lеt me get my dentist on thе phone (On the phone)
Found my keys, then I went back out
Someone asked me how it all went down
I remember like it's yesterday (Like it's yesterday)
I took a shot, took a shot, took a shot, took another shot
Fell right out my fuckin' chair, swingin' for his eye
Then a big chrome ring flew in from the side
I thought I died
Why'd you have to go and fuckin' ruin my night?

This is like a private plane up on my ring
This is like the first time I bought a chain
This is like when I was sane, before the fame
Uh-oh, uh-oh, this life is crazy
This is like another thing I can't explain
This is like the summer flame that got away
I won't let another angel go to waste
Uh-oh, uh-oh, this life is crazy

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Oh, Vividus bed where I'm layin' my head (Ooh)
Devil on my back, so I sleep on my chest
Waitin' at the gate, how'd they get my address?
(How'd they get my address?)
On my last nerve whilе I'm rippin' cigarettes
It's a killer I know, it's a killеr I know
I just need a lil' somethin', get me through the day
Yeah, my mind is blank or I overthink
It's gettin' old, but it's nothin' new
I say your name when you're not around
When I'm drunk and my knees can't pick me up

I want it all, I want it all, I push so hard, I break it
My only home went down in smoke
It's bittersweet, I taste it
So, are you lonely? 'Cause I'm healin' slowly
In a moment, your memory is fading on me
Got no expectations now that I'm forsaken
Let's see what I'm made of, find out if I can take it, now

[Chorus]
When I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me, who's to blame for this?

[Verse 2]
All I wanted was a piece of decent on the side (On the side)
When we go to bed, she be creepin' on my side (On my side)
I was drinkin' all day, I let her spend the night
When I took her home, she left somethin' in my ride, in my ride (Damn)
Then my baby found out
Now I'm livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel
Ain't that bad, I got room service
Livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel

So I close my eyes and wait for a miracle
And everything done for the dead after they're dead, is for the living
And everything done on a day, goddamn it, that's our decision
I kept my eyes closed, it was easy, now I see it with perfect vision
And everything done for the dead after they're dead, is for the living
Fuck me up, fuck it, get fucked up, hey
Fuck me up, yeah, and stay fucked up

Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream

We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'

You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em

It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights (Yeah)

Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need, ayy (That ain't what I need)

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold fifteen million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain’t ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on ’em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Yeah, they bet I'ma fall
And I’m only 24, but, bitch, I been through it all
I got so many hits, can’t remember them all (Ooh)
While I'm takin’ a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain’t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah

When it was time to do some work and put it in (Put it in)
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them (Ha)
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win (Uh)
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I

And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

Wonder if it'll come out on the web

Takin' a photo and postin' that shit
Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, ""Where have you been?""

We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge

Never know when someone come and try to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got ""Malone"" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands

Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, ""¡No más!"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, ""Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?"" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', ""Where the coke at?"" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car

When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended

With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah

Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (Of an ugly truth)

I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone

Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

Take me right to you (Take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back

You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (What an ugly truth)
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (And we can make it through)

My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

Now all these people wanna keep on takin' pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you (Breeze for you)
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

I done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 is like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I'm goin' next, man, only time will tell

I done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit
I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits, so I'm fuckin' your bitch (Ooh)
No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (Skrrt)
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker, talk saucy
Pass me them drugs, motherfucker, let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothes
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly, but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grilly
I do this for realy and for my family
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y

Good job, First
Woah, skrrt, skrrt

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone & 2 Chainz]
Diamonds in my chain gold (Okay)
Every twenty minutes, change clothes (Change up)
I had a mil' before the label (That money)
Just as long as they know, money made me do it (They know)
I said rest in peace to Bankroll (Free, God bless you)
You in a better place, dawg (God bless you)
You won't ever see me lay low (They know it)
Start the engine, watch me take off, money made me do it (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Take a ride when we wake up
Hit the gas, melt your face off (Your face)
Spend the day countin' cake up
With a dime, who think I changed up? (I changed up)
I took the Lincoln down Rodeo (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ran through it like some Drano (Ooh, ooh)
Lot of bags, can't complain, though (No, no)
We was shoppin' in 'til they closed
Why did I do that? Did I do that? Ooh, yeah (Uh)
New whip, now, I can't pay my rent, ooh, no, oh, ooh, yeah

Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'

I done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 is like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I'm goin' next, man, only time will tell

[Refrain]
Woah-oh

[Verse 2]
I done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit
I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits, so I'm fuckin' your bitch (Ooh)
No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (Skrrt)
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker, talk saucy
Pass me them drugs, motherfucker, let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothes
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly, but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grilly
I do this for realy and for my family
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y
The bitches, they killin' me
Like, bitch, are you kiddin' me?
Ballin', that shit Jason Kidd to me
You can't get rid of me
Yeah, you want my chain and my chi

And I don't care 'bout no money
There's a knot up in my throat
And I didn't come here on my own

Yeah, my wrist so cold and my ice on froze
And it's all for you
Yeah, my ice so cold and my wrist so froze

My jewelry on like an ice cube
And all I wanna do is just ignite you
This Saint Laurent, mama, you look nice too
Can't hold my tongue, don't got the heart to
Remember when I fell in love?
I just came up, oh lord
Remember aim three? My fault
Told that bad bitch get on my VLONE
Hey, don't have much to do and
Everything is ruined
Ayy, ain't no secret to it
Thrown a check like a Nike, I just do it
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my god, oh my god
A lot of bullshit on my mind
Oh my god, oh my god
Think about you all the time
Oh my god, oh my god
And I don't care 'bout no money
There's a knot up in my throat
And I didn't come here on my own

Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on

Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

I done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 is like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I'm goin' next, man, only time will tell

Woah-oh

I done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit
I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits, so I'm fuckin' your bitch (Ooh)
No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (Skrrt)
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker, talk saucy
Pass me them drugs, motherfucker, let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothes
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly, but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grilly
I do this for realy and for my family
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y
The bitches, they killin' me
Like, bitch, are you kiddin' me?
Ballin', that shit Jason Kidd to me
You can't get rid of me

Good job, First
Woah, skrrt, skrrt

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone & 2 Chainz]
Diamonds in my chain gold (Okay)
Every twenty minutes, change clothes (Change up)
I had a mil' before the label (That money)
Just as long as they know, money made me do it (They know)
I said rest in peace to Bankroll (Free, God bless you)
You in a better place, dawg (God bless you)
You won't ever see me lay low (They know it)
Start the engine, watch me take off, money made me do it (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Take a ride when we wake up
Hit the gas, melt your face off (Your face)
Spend the day countin' cake up
With a dime, who think I changed up? (I changed up)
I took the Lincoln down Rodeo (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ran through it like some Drano (Ooh, ooh)
Lot of bags, can't complain, though (No, no)
We was shoppin' in 'til they closed
Why did I do that? Did I do that? Ooh, yeah (Uh)
New whip, now, I can't pay my rent, ooh, no, oh, ooh, yeah

Pocket full of street money (Street), 'bout to count my blessin' (Street)
One hundred, one thousand, one hundred K, one million (Uh)
We smoke, we laugh, we rap, we talked about a vision (Switch it up, haha)
I got diamonds like a rainbow every time I change clothes
Shawty fucked my friend, but I act like I ain't know
I'ma buy a raincoat, the storm might approach you
Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus
I do it on purpose, do it for the neighborhood
Smokin' on that Meagan Good, with my niggas when I do it
Got that leather and that wood, I got the marble on the floor
Got the burglar bars on the door at the bando

I've been looking for someone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Post-Chorus]

We gon' tour motherfucker, came up, I ain't lonely
Gotta problem, Santiago, 45 by the gut

And they think it smells good and they all want a puff (They want a puff)

Diamonds in my chain gold (Okay)
Every twenty minutes, change clothes (Change up)
I had a mil' before the label (That money)
Just as long as they know, money made me do it (They know)
I said rest in peace to Bankroll (Free, God bless you)
You in a better place, dawg (God bless you)
You won't ever see me lay low (They know it)

Take a ride when we wake up
Hit the gas, melt your face off (Your face)
Spend the day countin' cake up
With a dime, who think I changed up? (I changed up)
I took the Lincoln down Rodeo (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ran through it like some Drano (Ooh, ooh)
Lot of bags, can't complain, though (No, no)

Why did I do that? Did I do that? Ooh, yeah (Uh)

We gotta take the phones because we can't let nobody see
We pop a pill since you ain't have not a thing to eat, oh, oh, ooh

Malone is on some other shit, but player that's some old news
Roll through and showed you that I just bought some dope shoes
My shit screwed, my bitch new
Haters standing like statues
Bitch, I am trying to get that Dubai money
You can't count it cause it's too high money
You fuckers rapping, and I am laughing cause it is too damn funny
Got a playboy bunny and she tryna take these boxers from me
A cuban and some [?] don
Can't afford that shit that I am on
A mother fucking rap phenomenon
All my checks, don't forget to add the motherfucking comma's on
Expensive vices, paying too much for liquor
You'd have to put 'em down if my raps were any sicker
You'd have to put me down if my swag was any slicker
Perc my shit on top of your shit, check the bumper sticker

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Change for you fuckboy ass
Double park the Range, on your fuckboy ass?
She's looking right [?]
But that shit will never change, huh?

If I call your name, would you answer me?
And if I said goodbye, would you stay with me?
And if I promise you a place to go, when you are all alone
Would you take it and be on your way home?
God put us on this Earth to love
And He can take us back in the name of blood
And I know that might sound a little unfair
'Cause at the worst times, He takes the one you care for
And as cancer eats and eats, I'm waiting for my long sleep to finally
Take me home

[Interlude]
And you'll finally be right where you belong
Where you were made, whеre you were mеant to be

[Verse 2]
When your feet touch the gold, the gold of the floor
And you'll see your past loved ones, and you'll need nothing more
Because you know that you're loved, wherever you are
We'll miss you so, but you're not that far

Not with me makes me sad
So that's why I just don't think of love

Gotta get back to the way it was, back when all we needed was still love
Oh the love, oh
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, I wanna see it fall in place
I never thought this way
But now I got to face the facts that I will never have you back

Holy Infant so tender and mild

Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heav'nly hosts sing Alleluia;

Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace

There's a man standing on the stairs
And when he breathes, it shakes my structure
I don’t know when and I don't know where
But he says everything will be fine (yeah)

[Verse 2]
He calls me by my first name
That's funny ’cause I've never seen his face
And then he tells me to live for life
That it all will fall into place

[Chorus]
The clouds pass by like a man in a race
That loses control to keep up his pace
There is nowhere that I'd rathеr be than here
With you, my dеar

[Verse 3]
The gates open and close to a foreign tongue
And the river pushes my eye to an alternate universe
And I may be a giant
But the gates, they are too tall

[Verse 4]
And I chose to fall for it every time
They give me what I want
But it's never enough

The clouds pass by like a man in a race
That loses control to keep up his pace
There is nowhere that I'd rather be than here
With you, my dearEmbed"

Living off expired pride is getting old
And I've been eating precious gems, diamonds and gold
So much that I shine in the moonlight
But in the daytime, I'm never all that bright

[Pre-Chorus]
I have forgotten that

[Chorus]
That the skies, they are so big with your eyes open
And here's to hoping that I can open them wider than they've ever been
Because living off expired pride is getting old
Oh man, it's getting old

[Verse 2]
And all that is false glows in the dark
But you can nevеr find it when it's lit
You see, it's easy to be somеone you're not
When the someone you're not is all that you got
And you don't want to lose what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
You have forgotten that

[Chorus]
That the skies, they are so big with your eyes open
And here's to hoping that I can open them wider than they've ever been
Because living off expired pride is getting old
It's getting old, yes, it's getting old, yeah

My shadow, shadow is scared of itself
You can see it in its eyes
Its ears are starting to ache from the sound of lullabies
I'm almost hanging on, but when I jump, I just land shy
Of the ledge that I'm aiming for that is way too high

[Pre-Chorus]
I have forgotten that
I have forgotten that

[Chorus]
That the skies, they are so big with your eyes open (The afternoons I spent with you, the nights I prayed that you pull through)
And here's to hoping that I can open them wider than they've ever been (They're everything I gave to you, they're everything I gave to you)
Because living off expired pride is getting old (The afternoons I spent with you, the nights I prayed that you pull through)
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, it's getting old (They're everything I gave to you, they're everything I gave to you)Embed"

You got a lot of nerve, don't you, baby?
I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why'd you throw them stones if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with the view
I thought you knew

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, ""Teamwork makes the dream work""
Hell, I had some help (Help)
(Help)

[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen]
You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumbling
Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
Already lost the game that you've been runnin'
Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this
