(Diese kleine unheimliche Insel hat mich zu einer Waffe gemacht)
(Wir glauben beide—)
(Cette petite île étrange a fait de moi une arme)

Welcome back to Trench
Welcome back to Trench

[Break]
I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)

[Verse 1]
Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react, acting
Gobsmacked, don't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate
I feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyes
Don't sleep on a boy who can't fall asleep twice
In the same night, and won't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate
See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also like[Chorus]
I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

[Verse 2]
Where am I from? I was born right here, just now
Originated right in front of your eyes
If you can't see, I am Clancy, prodigal son
Done running, come up with Josh Dun, wanted dead or alive
So now you pick who you serve, you bow to the masses
Get kicked to the curb for passin' the classes
Half empty, half full, save half for your taxes
Then overtake your former self

[Chorus]
I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

[Bridge]
Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón
The days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón
[Refrain]
Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react, acting
Gobsmacked, don't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate

Rat race, place to place, adding weight
Tendencies on repeat, innit?
Benefit from a shoe with no lace
Take the seat with the crease in it
I don't mind if it's lonely
I don't mind if it's fair
I don't care, you control me
Leading me anywhere

[Chorus]
I don't wanna backslide to where I've started from
There's no chance I will shake this again
'Cause I feel the pull, water's over my head
Strength enough for onе more time
Reach my hand abovе the tide
I'll take anything you have
If you could throw me a line
I should've loved you better
Do you think that now's the time
You should let go?
It's over my head

Bad place, on a hundred-dollar bass
Kinda wishin' that I never did ""Saturday""
""Is that a stain? You should change
Are you doin' good?
Did you solve all of your problems?""
Thanks for asking, in a way, but
Accidentally uncovered a new one yesterday
What happened to what I brushed under the rug?
I used to be the champion of a world you can't see
Now I'm drowning in logistics

I don't wanna backslide to where I've started from

[Verse 1]
Seems I get in my own way
The more I think, the less I say
I hope I communicate the craving
Now I see intentions don't mean much

[Chorus]
Say enough, say enough
Did I let her know, let her know
If I found my body in chains
I'd lay down in wait
And hope she looks for me
And hope she looks for me

[Verse 2]
She just wants to catch a wave
Ride it off to the end of the days
I hope that I can satiate the craving
Now I see the gesture don't mean much

[Chorus]
Say enough, say enough
Did I let her know, lеt her know
If I found my body in chains
I'd lay down in wait
And hope she looks for mе
And hope she looks for me

And I just hate to put this on her
But I swear that I will give more than I take away
Mm, the craving

Please welcome twenty one pilots

[Tyler Joseph]
Hello, we're twenty one pilots and welcome to our ""MTV Unplugged""
Now, as you can see, up here, we're very plugged
Um, but to me, this series has become less about performing your songs acoustically
And more about a band and/or an artist presenting themselves in a different way than they traditionally would
Usually when Josh and I perform, we play with pre-recorded tracks
But tonight, what wе're gonna do
Is we're gonna build out thosе tracks in real time in front of you
And using hands-free looping and some sampling
Hopefully, if we play everything right and in time
We'll end up with brand-new versions of our songs
There might be a few awkward transitions between songs
Because we have a lot to kind of, like, preset
So just embrace the awkwardness, I guessSee ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also likeEmbed"

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler Joseph & Josh Dun, Josh Dun]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph & Josh Dun]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

[Verse 2: Tyler Joseph]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one (One, one)
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam (Roam, roam)
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

For this part, we're actually gonna sample you guys
And use your voices
Putting them into this keyboard here
So don't mess up
This is your note, sounds like this, ah
Ah (Ah)
Ready? One, two, three, four

I don't know, it's pretty good
So Josh is sampling that
Give it a try
That's me
Give it a try now
There they are
Yeah?
It feels pretty good
Good job
Yeah (That's good)
All right, let's put some of those effects on there to sweeten it up

Will you take care of me?""

I will plan to be a bum

[Verse: Tyler Joseph & Crowd]
I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast (Ah)
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this (Ah)
Forget sanity, salary, vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love an' me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless (Ah)
[Chorus: Tyler Joseph & Crowd]
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
We go where we want to (Ah)
They think this thing is a highway, highway
Will they be alive tomorrow? (Ah)
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
We go where we want to (Ah)
They think this thing is a highway, highway

See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talkin' to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions, they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

What a beautiful day for making a break for it

Start a mob and you can be quite certain

I wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one, be the one who has the
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

[Chorus]
But I'll tell 'em, ""Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant""
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell 'em

On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost, ""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me""

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind

Night falls, with gravity
The Earth turns, from sanity
Taking my only friend I know
He leaves a lot, his name is Hope

[Chorus]
I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside
[Verse 2]
The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near
When the sun is climbing window sills
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun makes the hills its grave

[Chorus]
I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside
I'm never what I like!
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind

And shadows burn

It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give these places fake my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times
I have committed dirty, dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing and fusing
And believe me, that's what all the kids are doing
What kids are doing, they're killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner cell
And if you're one of them, then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free
Yeah, am I right? Of course I am, convince me otherwise would take all night
Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but that's okay

Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music
It's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
To the chorus

You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
And I'll be holdin' on to you-ou
And I'll be holdin' on to you-ou

[Verse 2]
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it, tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it to a tree tell it
""You belong to me, this ain't a noose
This is a leash and I have news for you
You must obey me!""

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my, oh oh
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith, okay

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone, lone, lone...

[Verse 1]
I, I, I, I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my depress...ing thoughts
I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far... kid

[Verse 2]
I am not as fine as I seem
Pardon, me for yelling and telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast, feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far... kid
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it

I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's a stomach inside my brain
I don't wanna be heard, I wanna be listened to
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?
Oh, does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name, your name?

I scream, you scream
We all scream, 'cause we're terrified
Of what's around the corner
We stay in place
'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives
So let's think of something better

Quickly moving towards the storm, moving forward, torn
Into pieces over reasons of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that? When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?
This is not what you're supposed to see
Please, remember me?
I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom, or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
The situation's becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned
Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus (Forest, chorus)
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

We have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is

I know there's someone at the door
They called for help, of this I'm sure
But do I want to say goodbye
To all the glowing eyes?
I'm holding on to what I know
And what I know, I must let go

[Verse 1: Tyler Joseph]
Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, I'm my catastrophe
At my kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me
Okay, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah, it might be worthless
Then paint something, and it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning
Of your meaning, friend

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game
And say they know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you
And neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand-up guy who
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother
And his head's screwed up, but that's all right

[Bridge: Zack Joseph]
Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary, sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moment's mending memories
Pretending enemies are friends of me
Sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm, the badder I am
But I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gamblin' man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
Go away, go away
Go away, go away

You say things with your mouth, cobwebs and flies come out

Luckily I can read your mind, flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down, they will not cast you out, out

Dear friend, here we are again
Pretending to understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you'll see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do
So try to love me and I'll try to save you

Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm

[Verse 1]
I don't bother anyone
Nervous when I stand
Chokin' on the circumstance
Only smokin' secondhand (Mm-mm)
Cut us open, spread us out (Mm-mm)
Dry us in the sand (Mm-mm)
Lay the fibers side by side (Mm-mm)
And you'll begin to understand (Mm-mm)

I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me
Comin' for me

Mm-mm (I know it's over)

[Verse 2]
I don't bother anyone
Never make demands
Chokin' on the circumstance
Self-sabotage is a sweet romance (Mm-mm)
Seems like all I'm worth is what I'm able to withstand (Mm-mm)
Sooner I can realize that pain is just a middleman

I see no volunteers to co-sign on my fears

Alone, I'm gonna change my circumstance
I know I need to move right now

'Cause I know it's over

Nobody's comin' for me (Only smokin' secondhand)
I know it's over

Nobody's comin' for me
Comin' for me

[Verse 3]
Like a little splinter buried in your skin
Someone else can carve it out but when you've got the pin
It hurts a little less and you can even push it further in
When your body's screamin' out, trust your mind's listenin'
Like a silhouette that you can barely see
As a shadow cast upon the ground where you'll eventually
Lay forever, but the day goes on, the sun moves behind you
You get taller, bolder, stronger, and the rearview only blinds you

There was a wonderful structure to the city
And it put my cares to rest
(Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Takin' inventory of his life
Seein' snapshots chronologically in line
Something told him he should look around and tidy up
He collected many things but never quite enough
Tried lookin' at it from a new perspective
Flat on his back but he still heard the directive
Orders from that corner where that shadow always lived
Never asked permission, he just hopes that they forgive

[Chorus]
I don't want to go like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
At least let me clean my room
I don't want to leave like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause the last thing I want to do is
Make my people make decisions, wonderin' what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display
Or redecorate?

[Verse 2]
Blankets over mirrors, she tends to like it
She's not afraid of her reflection
But of what she might see behind it
She had plans to change her name (Yeah)
Just not the traditional way (Yeah)
Haunted by a couple big mistakes
She covers all the dents with the way she decorates
Then one night, she got cold with no blankets on her bed
So she ripped them off the mirror, stepped back and she said

[Bridge]
With the bells and the whistles scaled back
Like an isolated track
And he feels trapped when he's not inebriated
Fair to say he's fairly sedated most days of the week
He might have made it if he lived on a different street
I repeat, scaled back and isolated
He says he likes an open schedule, but he mostly hates it
If you're running to his room, take a breath before you break in
Put your ear up to the door, tell me, can you hear him saying?

[Verse 1]
I don't bother anyone
Nervous when I stand
Chokin' on the circumstance
Only smokin' secondhand
Cut us open, spread us out
Dry us in the sand
Lay the fibers side by side
And you'll begin to understand

[Chorus]
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me
Comin' for me

I don't bother anyone
Never make demands
Chokin' on the circumstance
Self-sabotage is a sweet romance (Mm-mm)
Seems like all I'm worth is what I'm able to withstand (Mm-mm)

I know I need to move right now

'Cause I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me, only smokin' secondhand
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me
Comin' for me

[Verse 3]
Like a little splinter buried in your skin
Someone else can carve it out but when you've got the pin
It hurts a little less and you can even push it further in
When your body's screamin' out, trust your mind's listenin'
Like a silhouette that you can barely see
As a shadow cast upon the ground where you'll eventually
Lay forever, but the day goes on, the sun moves behind you
You get taller, bolder, stronger, and the rearview only blinds you
[Part II: Stressed Out]

[Intro]
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
Wake up you need to make money
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
Wake up you need to make money

[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We'd build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names

[Part III: Migraine]

[Intro]
(Am I the only one I know)
(Waging my war behind my face and above my throat?)
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my depress...ing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far... kid

[Part IV: Morph]

[Intro]
Hello out there
Repeat after me now
Woah-oh (Woah-oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woah-oh (Woah-oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that ""if"" and ""when"" are truly different cries
For ""if"" is purely panic and ""when"" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
(If I keep moving, they won't know)
Hey (I'll morph to someone else)
(What they throw at me's too slow)
Yeah (I'll morph to someone else)
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
(A defense mechanism mode)

[Break]
Hey (Hey)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
Hey (Hey)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode

But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1]
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless, honest
Therе's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry, it seems to mе that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows

Scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love an' me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry

Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head

But now you double as a paper maker

I hope that they choke on smoke

This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream

[Verse 1]
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-oh-oh-oh
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions, they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, yeah
Takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah-oh

[Part IV: Car Radio]

[Chorus]
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 1]
Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 2]
I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Bridge]
Woah, oh woah oh
Woah, oh woah oh (And now I just sit in silence)
Woah, oh woah oh (And now I just sit in silence)
Woah, oh woah oh
And now I just sit
Woah, oh woah oh (And now I just sit in silence)
Woah, oh woah oh (And now I just sit in silence)
Woah, oh woah oh (And now I just sit in silence)
Woah, oh woah oh
And now I just sit

They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm

[Verse 1]
I don't bother anyone
Nervous when I stand
Chokin' on the circumstance
Only smokin' secondhand (Mm-mm)
Cut us open, spread us out (Mm-mm)
Dry us in the sand (Mm-mm)
Lay the fibers side by side (Mm-mm)
And you'll begin to understand (Mm-mm)

I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me
Comin' for me

Mm-mm (I know it's over)
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
I don't bother anyone
Never make demands
Chokin' on the circumstance
Self-sabotage is a sweet romance (Mm-mm)
Seems like all I'm worth is what I'm able to withstand (Mm-mm)
Sooner I can realize that pain is just a middleman

I see no volunteers to co-sign on my fears

Alone, I'm gonna change my circumstance
I know I need to move right now

'Cause I know it's over

Nobody's comin' for me (Only smokin' secondhand)
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me

[Verse 3]
Like a little splinter buried in your skin
Someone else can carve it out but when you've got the pin
It hurts a little less and you can even push it further in
When your body's screamin' out, trust your mind's listenin'
Like a silhouette that you can barely see
As a shadow cast upon the ground where you'll eventually
Lay forever, but the day goes on, the sun moves behind you
You get taller, bolder, stronger, and the rearview only blinds you

There was a wonderful structure to the city
And it put my cares to rest
(Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Takin' inventory of his life
Seein' snapshots chronologically in line
Something told him he should look around and tidy up
He collected many things but never quite enough
Tried lookin' at it from a new perspective
Flat on his back but he still heard the directive
Orders from that corner where that shadow always lived
Never asked permission, he just hopes that they forgive

[Chorus]
I don't want to go like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
At least let me clean my room
I don't want to leave like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause the last thing I want to do is
Make my people make decisions, wonderin' what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display
Or redecorate?

[Verse 2]
Blankets over mirrors, she tends to like it
She's not afraid of her reflection
But of what she might see behind it
She had plans to change her name (Yeah)
Just not the traditional way (Yeah)
Haunted by a couple big mistakes
She covers all the dents with the way she decorates
Then one night, she got cold with no blankets on her bed
So she ripped them off the mirror, stepped back and she said

[Bridge]
With the bells and the whistles scaled back
Like an isolated track
And he feels trapped when he's not inebriated
Fair to say he's fairly sedated most days of the week
He might have made it if he lived on a different street
I repeat, scaled back and isolated
He says he likes an open schedule, but he mostly hates it
If you're running to his room, take a breath before you break in
Put your ear up to the door, tell me, can you hear him saying?

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind

But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was

[Verse 2]
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talkin' to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions, they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, you’re the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two

Move!

[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that ""if"" and ""when"" are truly different cries
For ""if"" is purely panic and ""when"" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode

Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, ""How could he go if he's got everything?
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king""

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking ""I'll teach them""
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved

Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I’ll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you’re a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

In City, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it

Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help

[Bridge]
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man

[Verse]
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, you’re the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place

They say ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1: Tyler Joseph]
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless, honest
There's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playing shows

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
They say ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack
Back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that’s flawless

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
They say ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1]
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke
'Cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm (I'm)
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm (I'm)

One time to twist and one time to shout

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time (Time, time) to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Out, oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Out, out, out, out)

[Post-Chorus]
We're stressed out (Out, out, out, out)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

When the sun shines on the ground

Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music
It's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind

'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

[Chorus]
But I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you, I might think twice
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind

But because of you, I might think twice

[Verse 1]
When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way, right time, wrong place
As I pled my case

[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please, take me

[Verse 2]
Three lights are lit, but the fourth one's out
I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house
So I head out down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out and now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking ""Wow, I probably should've stayed inside my house""

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way, right time, wrong place
As I pled my case

They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1]
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows

[Chorus]
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

Hello, and welcome to the Blurryface Tour
How we doin' so far? We doin' alright?
Is it cool if we play a few older ones for ya, yeah?

[Verse 1: Joseph]
Your grandpa died when you were nine
They said he had lost his mind
You have learned way too soon
You should never trust the pantaloon
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind

[Verse 2: Joseph]
I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind

[Verse 3: Joseph, Crowd, Joseph & Crowd]
Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote
Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

Oh, I'm trying to be so cool

[Verse 5: Joseph]
I'll tell 'em
Why won't you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell 'em
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell 'em

[Bridge: Joseph]
Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind
And I haven't found a drop
[Verse 6: Joseph]
I tried desperately to run through the sand as I
Hold the water in the palm of my hand
Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need and
The waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I tried my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just being dramatic, in fact
I'm only at it again as an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind, as it blows me back and forth
Mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a ""crazy, suicidal head"" case
But you specialize in dying, you hear me screaming, ""Father!""
And I'm lying here just crying, so wash me with your water

[Outro: Joseph, Crowd, Joseph & Crowd]

And the comments will always become common

I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost, ""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me""

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like ""Who would you live for?"" ""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?""

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And-a from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one, please, because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

Hello, and welcome to the Blurryface Tour
How we doin' so far? We doin' alright?
Is it cool if we play a few older ones for ya, yeah?

[Verse 1: Joseph]
Your grandpa died when you were nine
They said he had lost his mind
You have learned way too soon
You should never trust the pantaloon
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind

[Verse 2: Joseph]
I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind

Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus

Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind
And I haven't found a drop
[Verse 6: Joseph]
I tried desperately to run through the sand as I
Hold the water in the palm of my hand
Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need and
The waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I tried my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just being dramatic, in fact
I'm only at it again as an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind, as it blows me back and forth
Mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a ""crazy, suicidal head"" case
But you specialize in dying, you hear me screaming, ""Father!""
And I'm lying here just crying, so wash me with your water

Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity

Even when I doubt you (Doubt you)
I'm no good without you, no, no

Temperature is dropping, temperature is dropping
I'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no
You are all that I've got, no

Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted
Want the markings made on my skin
To mean something to me again
Hope you haven't left without me

[Verse 1]
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke
'Cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time (Time, time) to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Out, oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Out, out, out, out)

[Post-Chorus]
We're stressed out (Out, out, out, out)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real

And ""Would you ever kill?""

They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1]
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows

[Chorus]
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)

I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry

Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way, right time, wrong place
As I pled my case

[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please, take me

[Verse 2]
Three lights are lit, but the fourth one's out
I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house
So I head out down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out and now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking ""Wow, I probably should've stayed inside my house""

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way, right time, wrong place
As I pled my case

[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please
[Bridge]
I don't know if this song
Is a surrender or a revel
I don't know if this one
Is about me or the devil
I don't know if this song
Is a surrender or a revel
I don't know if this one
Is about me or the devil

'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

People, they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line
It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it for others to use it
You're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
Life is up here but you comment below
And the comments will always become common
Motivation to promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment
But you and I know it gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember the morning is when night is dead

'Cause I don't wanna fall

[Verse 1]
Every time I feel selfish ambition is takin' my vision
My crime is my sentence, repentance is takin' commission
It's takin' a toll on my soul, I'm screamin' submission and
I don't know if I am dyin' or livin'
'Cause I will save face for name's sake, abuse grace
Take aim to obtain a new name in a newer place
But my name is lame, I can't walk and I ain't the same
And my name became a new destiny to the grave

And I, I can feel the pull begin
I feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin, it will start
To break up and fall apart

Speaking of ""Back in the day,"" the boys would now like to show you some of their older songs if that's alright with all of you

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's stomach inside my brain
I don't wanna be heard, I wanna be listened to
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream, you scream
We all scream, 'cause we're terrified
O' what's around the corner
We stay in place
'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives
So let's think of somethin' better

[Chorus]
Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singin' songs that nobody wrote

[Verse 2]
My brain has given up, white flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought, it might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain throws up onto the page
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?

Quickly movin' towards the storm, movin' forward, torn
Into pieces over reasons of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everythin' I adore
Takes a different form when I squints my eyes
Have you ever done that? When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?
This is not what you're supposed to see
Please, remember me?
I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom, or swingin' on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
The situation's becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned

Come on!

I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, Is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one
Be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon, forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon
The Pavilion!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not takin' prisoners, okay!
Oh, yeah
Whoo
Why am I not scared in the mornin'?
I don't hear those voices callin'
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yellin'
Those crazy words they were spellin'
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

One, two!

[Verse 2]
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes, 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yellin', ""There's somethin' we need!""
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you who I'm singin' towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

Come on!
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not takin' prisoners

Need to pick one please because

[Verse 3]
We've turned our hands to guns
Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist
I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

[Break]
Thank you so much for having us
Alright, we're gonna create circle right in the middle
We spread out, spread out
One last chorus

[Chorus]
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to sleep
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to sleep
But I can't when you all have

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence (Silence, silence, silence, silence, silence)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep, we
Need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

What do I know when I'm forced to think beyond the radio, the radio?
What do I see? That we're all the same and I'm my own person, me?

Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then you'll never understand

I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more ""shotty""
I bet a lot of me was lost
""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

What's up everybody, we're twenty one pilots
And, uh, we're super full of ourselves so I apologize
This first song is called Ode To Sleep

[Verse 1]
I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, Is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one
Be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon, forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

[Pre-Chorus]
How are you all feeling so far? Good? Alright cool
We're gonna get going, let's do this
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone
See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56[Chorus]
But I tell 'em, why won't you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell 'em

[Verse 2]
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes, cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa
I'll stay awake cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Oh yeah
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out

Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone...
Spotify house, how you doing so far, good?
Okay, I got something to say

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my depress...ing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast, feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far... kid

Yeah yeah yeah

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more ""shotty""
I bet a lot of me was lost,
""T""’s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can’t trust me
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
And I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you

Give it up for my good friend Josh on the drums over here

[Verse 2]
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it’s frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it, tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it to a tree tell it,
""You belong to me, this ain’t a noose
This is a leash and I have news for you
You must obey me!""

This song is a true story

[Verse 1]
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 2]
Sometimes quiet is violent, I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56[Verse 3]
I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep, we
Need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
[Bridge]
And now I just sit
And now I just sit
And now I just sit
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit

[Verse 4]
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Thank you so much, one more time can we give it up
for Josh on the drums over here
And we're twenty one pilots, we're from Ohio
Like I said this is our first year ever at South By Southwest
I remember one time, I was telling the guys in the van
Couple years ago I submitted to play here
They just sent back some brochures for me to buy a wristband
So, now we're here, it's cool
You guys are the first crowd we ever played in front of at South by Southwest, so thank you so much
Wanna thank Spotify so much for uh, having us
They've been a big supporter of us, thank you so much
This is our last song, it's called Guns For Hands
What's gonna happen is, there's a part at the end of the song
I wanna create a big circle in the middle
So if you guys wanna circle around, I'll tell you when to do it
Don't do it yet

I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone
And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know-ow-ow what that means, I know-ow-ow-ow-ow

And you never put the safety on

We've turned our hands to guns
Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist
I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

Thank you so much for having us
Alright, we're gonna create circle right in the middle

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind

I wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one, be the one who has the
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

[Chorus]
But I'll tell 'em, ""Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant""
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell 'em

On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?

I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone
And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know-ow-ow
What that means, I know-ow-ow-ow-ow

[Chorus]
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

[Verse 2]
Let's take this a second at a time
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme
Together, let's breathe
Together, to the beat
But there's hope out the window
So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then you'll never understand

We've turned our hands to guns
Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music
It's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone, lone, lone...

[Verse 1]
I, I, I, I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my depress...ing thoughts
I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far... kid

[Verse 2]
I am not as fine as I seem
Pardon, me for yelling and telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast, feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far... kid
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

You say things with your mouth, cobwebs and flies come out

Luckily I can read your mind, flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down, they will not cast you out, out

[Pre-Chorus]
Dear friend, here we are again
Pretending to understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you'll see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do
So try to love me and I'll try to save you

Won't you stay alive? I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely
Won't you stay alive? I'll take you on a ride

I wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one, be the one who has the
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

[Chorus]
But I'll tell 'em, ""Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant""
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell 'em

On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?

I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me

And tie it to a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid

(Ah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it

I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream

I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real

'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And-a from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one, please, because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on

And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near
When the sun is climbing window sills
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun makes the hills its grave

What kids are doing, they're killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner cell
And if you're one of them, then you're one of me

[Bridge]
We've turned our hands to guns
Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music
It's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist
[Chorus]
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
But I can't, but I can't when you all have

The first track is called Ode to Sleep, and I remember back when I was first trying to name the song, we actually played it live first before it was named, and this is back when we had kind of a small following in our hometown and it was small enough that everyone got to write on a piece of paper and put into a bucket it which name they wanted the song to be named. One was ""Ode to Sleep"", I forget—I honestly forget the other names of the songs, but it was cool because a hometown audience got to name the song. I like putting this song first on the album, because it kinda puts the listener through kind of a ""song structure boot camp,"" if you will, when it comes to them being able to anticipate what the rest of the album is. So Ode to Sleep is definitely one that we like to intro with, we open up a lot of our sets with this song and I’m really proud of how weird it is.See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56Embed"

I didn’t really know what else to call it other than just taking the words that I say most in the song and naming it. I always get this weird… like, 80’s rock vibe from the title of the song, which has always bothered me, but since then have gotten over. I remember the riff for the song ""Holding on to You"" — I can see it now, on the piano, on the keys. I’m very visual when I write music and I remember I accidentally jumped over a few notes when I was tryna figure out just the riff and I didn’t think it worked. Then I listened to it again and actually the riff anticipates the chord progression in a really nice way and then I fell in love with it. And then obviously, this is one of our key tracks that has been on this album that Josh and I — the other guy in my band — we’re a little… we don’t really know what it means exactly to have a single out because we’ve always just worked on a body of work, but this is one of those songs where we have to introduce ourselves and say “This is kind of who we are.” You know, this is one of those songs that’s kind of a staple for us.See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56Embed"

The content is something that I worked very hard on. When it came to the lyrical side of it everything kind of came together. I got the idea from — I actually did have a headache the day that I was writing it for sure, but then that wasn’t really the point, you know, I was trying to make that a metaphoric thing, where there's a lot going on in his head… and what's really cool is that this is one of those songs that as a songwriter, I like to kind of just emit some sort of message, almost like a ripple in the water and when I feel that ripple bounce off of someone else who resonates with what it is I’m going through and it starts coming back at me it's just a really cool feeling of you know, I'm not alone in what I'm going through. So Migraine is one those, kind of, almost a distress call type of song lyrically — and then it's, it's pretty dirty beat too.See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56Embed"

Honestly, I walked into this used music store place and I saw a ukulele and I bought it, just kind of spur of the moment. I wasn’t really thinking. I had no idea how to play it. Taught myself how to play within, you know, a few days. It wasn’t — it’s not a very hard instrument to learn and I just knew that, you know, I don’t wanna be playing other people’s songs on this thing. I wanna try to write a song which is how I’ve always approached instruments. So I tried to write a song right away and started off very simple, just strumming out that bottom string, you know, which is a C. And I just kept it going and I was just—and I kept doing that until I found the melody I was looking for. And, you know, my mom is a big inspiration to me and so the song really talks about her and what it is that I wanna do for her and whether that be financially or just in other ways too. So she means a lot to me and so this song House of Gold is about her.See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56Embed"

I really don’t remember making decisions on the structure, it just happened and I don’t remember slaving over when to bring in the beats, when to stop the beat… it just — it was one of those songs that just kind of happened for me when I was demoing it out, it just — the structure just seemed so natural to me. And when I was done with it and I was showing other people, that’s when I realised that it’s a vеry unnatural song… but it just worked for me, so that’s kinda why I stuck to it. It’s one of thosе songs where, when we show people our stuff for the first time, they don’t really get that one, but I kinda like that. And so the song Car Radio actually is about — I was going to college, and my car radio got stolen out of my car and, I don’t know if anyone’s like me, but whenever you get into a car the first thing you do is turn on music and I was unable to do that for a while. Of course, I’m an emotional dude, so I wrote a song about it. But it was interesting to see how, when I remove the distraction of music from my life and my car, where my brain would go. You know the thoughts that would go through my mind. It was interesting and I still encourage people to take some time to just sit in silence every once in a while ‘cause a lot of things can come out. A lot of things that need to come out, come out, so that song reminds me of that time in my life and that lesson that I learned.See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56Embed"

Most of the other songs on the album, we’ve kind of — we’ve formed and kind of developed what that looks like live, and that’s truly who we are. We’re a live band and we love playing live music. So Semi-Automatic is one of those kind of challenging songs where we’re looking forward to trying to make that a part of our repertoire. And, lyrically, it’s a lot of the same themes as the rest of the album. It’s very introspective, and I know I talk about the night time a lot. I feel like I listen to a lot of pop music today that talks about the night in a completely different way than I talk about the night. There’s a lot of writers that talk about the night as in like it’s awesome time, that everyone’s partying or whatever, and usually night time for me is like the worst — that’s when everything comes out for me. That’s when I realize that I don’t really understand why I’m here or what I’m doing and it’s when the doubts happen. So a lot of these songs are kind of showing you the things that I’m thinking at night.

I’ve always… I’ve never wanted to be ""the ukulele guy"". You know, I don’t want like one song to be defining my career as a songwriter. So every time I write a song on the ukulele I’m like “I hope this isn’t a hit ‘cause I don’t wanna be the ukulele guy.” But this song, Screen, is — I’ve always pictured people singing this song with me. I’ve never not pictured a bunch of people singing this song with me, it’s always been a very collective group mentality to this song and which is why it’s got kind of that upbeat feel to it and it’s very different than most of the other songs on the album, but which song isn’t, you know. I truly don’t want anyone to anticipate what’s happening next. I don’t know why any writer would want that. But Screen is one of my favorite to play live. It’s just fresh.

There’s a lot of downtime when you record an album, whether that be waiting for someone to get drum tones, or you know, waiting for the producer to work on other tones and edit stuff. So, I was in another room on a piano a lot for the album — and actually going back to, you know, Migraine, I wrote a lot of Migraine on that piano — I wrote The Run and Go on this piano as well. So this was kind of a brand new idea brought to everybody from the recording process. And this song, The Run and Go, I always put myself somewhere mentally, you know, when I’m writing a song with ‘where do I wanna play this song?’ and I’ve always pictured myself playing a song like that on a festival-style show where obviously there’s a ton of people. And I don’t know if you’ve picked up on it, but I have a pretty crazy imagination and my dreams are pretty big, but this is one of those songs where I picture myself playing in the middle of the day — ‘cause we’re not that big yet, we’re not playing night time slots at festivals, but that’s okay, we can still be awesome during the day, you know.

I think that the melody inside of the verses is one of my favorite melodies where it goes to falsetto. I think that a lot of times I feel like writers slack on verses when it comes to melody. I feel like it’s like “these are my verses, this is kind of the part where peoplе wait for the chorus.” And I’ve always felt likе why not have the verses — the melody of the verses be just as infectious as the chorus? So I’m proud of this song in that way. Also, you know, it does the whole, you know, mash-up genre thing that everyone is freaking out about. Truly, I just didn’t know that there were rules to songwriting and, you know, so I just worked on transitioning from one genre to the next. I wanted to hear a song that did that. I’ve never heard a song do that before, I wanna hear that, so I made that. So this song is called Fake You Out.See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56Embed"

I mean, I’m saying exactly what I’m trying to say in the song, for me to explain what I’m trying to say in a different setting is kind of weird for me. But, Guns for Hands specifically, I like to talk about what that song’s trying to say. There was one show in particular that this song was inspired by. I was playing a show in Cincinnati, Ohio, and it’s just this kind of a barn full of kids, and after this show, more than usual, thеre was kind of an unusual number of kids came up to mе and felt inclined to share with me what it is they were going through. You know, a lot of their struggles, a lot of their, you know, whether that be depression or suicidal thoughts, a lot of stuff along that vein. And I just thought, I was like wow, I mean I’m — am I just in a hotbed of kids going through stuff, I mean is this just kind of like a crazy ratio of everyone struggling with this thing? And then I remember not too long after that, I was in New York, and I was — I think I saw like a pizza shop or something and I saw a magazine that was you know at the entrance of the pizza shop, this big article about this specific town in New York that has a lot of kids, you know, high school age, going through a lot of the same stuff. And I realized you know, this isn’t just a — it’s not just an isolated event, it’s something that there’s a lot of kids throughout the entire country — even the world — that are struggling with the questions that they have, you know, ‘what’s the point?’, ‘what’s my purpose?’, ‘why am I here?’ and when you don’t have the answers to those questions, sometimes it can lead you to do something that you ultimately shouldn’t do.

So, Guns for Hands is talking about I wanna tell you that I know you have the ability to hurt yourself. You do. You have that ability. I feel like a lot of the older generation when they hear about someone struggling with it, their first reaction is like, “No, you’re not, you’re not struggling with that. Don’t think about that, you know, think about something else, you know, you’re just trying to get attention.” But this song was really trying to say like; “Listen, I know you have the ability to hurt yourself. I recognize that, but let’s take that energy and let’s point it at something else, let’s divert that, let’s kind of shift that momentum and look at something like art, or something like this music specifically, or even point it at me, you know, just point it anywhere, but don’t point it at yourself.” And so that’s what that song’s saying and that song will always be important to me. And I’m not a professional when it comes to this topic, but I write songs, and I feel like someone should say something about it.See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56Embed"

And Trees is one of those songs for us — Josh and I have talked about it — it almost gives us a second wind, we don’t even know where that energy comes from, you know, we feel like there’s nothing left and then we play trees and something else kicks in. And so it’s one of my favorite songs to play live in front of a room of people who know the song. It’s really fun for us — it’s really fun to hear people sing those words to me, and to themselves, and to the room, and it’s one of those songs where you kinda get to give the show back to the audience and tell them; “This is your show; do what you want with it,” and I’ve seen a lot of crowds run with this song and it’s one of my favorites to play live.See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56Embed"

Obviously, you could look at the album and be like “yeah you didn’t do a good job of that,” you know, I’m sorry but the song Truce is cool ‘cause it’s just me and the piano. I remember when I was talking to my producer about what we wanted the piano to sound like, he put it best, he said; “You know, I want the piano to sound kind of distant like it’s behind several layer of curtains or something,” and so we kind of got a sound that [is] kinda a little bit eerie and not too in your face, just to kinda give the vocals that—the room to really say what it is that they’re trying to say. And Truce is one of those songs that I just wanted to tell people; “hang in there, you know, there’s someone out there who does know what you’re going through.” I know that there’s a lot of bands that say they want to use music to help people and I know a lot of that might be full of crap. But if someone is encouraged, at all, by the music that I write, then my whole life will be justified, so I mean I would be crazy not to try. So this song is called Truce and it closes out the album appropriately I think.See ​twenty one pilots LiveGet tickets as low as $56Embed"

I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost, ""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me""

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind

Night falls, with gravity

Taking my only friend I know
He leaves a lot, his name is Hope

The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near
When the sun is climbing window sills
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun makes the hills its grave

I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's a stomach inside my brain
I don't wanna be heard, I wanna be listened to
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?
Oh, does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name, your name?

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream, you scream
We all scream, 'cause we're terrified
Of what's around the corner
We stay in place
'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives
So let's think of something better

Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

Quickly moving towards the storm, moving forward, torn
Into pieces over reasons of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that? When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?
This is not what you're supposed to see
Please, remember me?
I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom, or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
The situation's becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned
Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus (Forest, chorus)
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

I wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one, be the one who has the
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

[Chorus]
But I'll tell 'em, ""Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant""

On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

I wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one, be the one who has the
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time

Hello, I've been travelin' in the deserts of my mind
And I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of You

Water
Oh

I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I try my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just bein' dramatic, in fact, I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth, bindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again, see You tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy, suicidal head-case
But You specialize in dyin', You hear me screamin', ""Father!""
And I'm lyin' here just cryin', so wash me with Your water

I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream

'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And-a from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one, please, because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive

To come across like I am dying

I bet a lot of me was lost, ""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me""

We've turned our hands to guns
Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music
It's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist
[Chorus]
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost, ""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me""

Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain

I wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one, be the one who has the
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

[Chorus]
But I'll tell 'em, ""Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant""
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell 'em

On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out

Would get together, I'd ride my bike and my brother would ride his
Put cards in our spokes and make our engines sound like traffic
When using Pokémon cards, please do not use the holographics
So bold and fearless in the risks we'd take
Laugh in the face of gravity as its laws we'd break
On trampolines so high, we'd reach for the sky

'Cause somebody stole my car radio

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And-a from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one, please, because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying

Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that? When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?
This is not what you're supposed to see
Please, remember me?
I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom, or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
The situation's becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands

[Verse 1: Tyler Joseph]
Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, I'm my catastrophe
At my kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me
Okay, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah, it might be worthless
Then paint something, and it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning
Of your meaning, friend

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game
And say they know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you
And neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand-up guy who
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother
And his head's screwed up, but that's all right

[Bridge: Zack Joseph]
Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary, sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moment's mending memories
Pretending enemies are friends of me
Sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm, the badder I am
But I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gamblin' man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
[Outro: Tyler Joseph]
Leave me alone!
Don't leave me alone!

I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I
Don't know where I should go and the tears and the fears begin to multiply
Taking time in a simple place; in my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase
And it's said that a war's lead but I forget that I let another day go by (Ah)
I want to be afraid but it seems that these days
I'm caught underwater and I'm falling farther
My heart's getting harder, I'm calling my father
Am I screaming to an empty sky?
Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause one half of my heart is free
Empty sky, no way, that's me, 'cause the other half of my heart's asleep48Embed"

Luckily I can read your mind, flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down, they will not cast you out, out

Dear friend, here we are again
Pretending to understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you'll see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do
So try to love me and I'll try to save you

Where'd you go, huh? They all think I know ya
It's so hard to motivate me to devote
A single inch of me to something I can't see
I don't mean to pry but why would you even make the eyes?
I don't believe my ears and I'm scared of my own head

Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Gullible, but lying's all I've learned

No music, and I can talk about anything
Whether or not it's worthwhile, it’s based on who's listenin'

All of us relate if it's something we've just been through
Taken for granted, trust is damaged and now we panic
Livin' empty handed, livin' lives like we can manage

I am disappearing inside my bird's eye theories
I tried to say goodbye, defy, and deny what it is I'm fearing

And when we're done
We'll all have made something new under the sun

Your grandpa died when you were nine
They said he had lost his mind
You have learned way too soon
You should never trust the Pantaloon

[Verse 2]
Now it's your turn to be alone
Find a wife and build yourself a home
You have learned way too soon
That your dad is now the Pantaloon

[Chorus]
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind

[Bridge]
He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air, how
He used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a Pantaloon

It's colder than you know

Used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night

By your nightmares and your frights

A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends, they fertilize the ground you walk

As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I try my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just bein' dramatic, in fact, I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth, bindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again, see You tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy, suicidal head-case
But You specialize in dyin', You hear me screamin', ""Father!""
And I'm lyin' here just cryin', so wash me with Your water

And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep

And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand

I don't fall slow like I used to, I fall straight down

The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me

[Verse 2]
And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I wanna crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart
For me to drive away with
I began to understand why God died

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The demon sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark, so he held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night

[Bridge]
And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said, ""I'll take the grave
Please, just send them all my way""
Then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

So the hearse ran out of gas
The passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully planned taxi cab
A cab, had a cleared out back
And two men started to unpack
Driving once again, but now this time, there were three men
And then I heard one of them say
""I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day""
And then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more, pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searchin' for
Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked, ""Am I alive and well
Or am I dreaming dead?""
Then one turned around to say
""We're driving toward the morning, son
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone""

That gives the demons and angels purpose

All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing
Remind us of things that nobody cares about
And honestly, we're probably
More suicidal than ever now
If you decide to live by
What you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me, you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning
And decide what we believe
We can take apart our very heart

[Verse 1]
You split, and take in every time you see a fake and counterfeit
In the mirror, you appear to see fear and whisper ""This is it""
At the mirror you appear to see nothing else
But yourself as a face, a hollowed-out space
Leave me with the razor, just in case I fall
Face down on the ground and somehow I found
Enough strength to lift my face and make a sound
And muffled though it may be, and crazy it seems
I never felt closer to you, just crying as you torture me

[Chorus]
(Time to say goodbye)
It's time to say goodbye
To the earth and now my worthless life
(Paesi che non ho mai)

(Time to... To...
Con te partirò
Su navi per mari
Che, io lo so
No, no, non esistono più)

[Outro]
(Con te partirò)
It's time to say goodbye
To the earth and now my worthless life
(Su navi per mari)
'Cause everything I've ever made
(Che, io lo so)
Is dead now, inside the grave
(Lo con te!)36Embed"

Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello, I've been travelin' in the deserts of my mind
And I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of You
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop of water

[Refrain]
Water
Oh
Oh

[Verse]
I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I try my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just bein' dramatic, in fact, I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth, bindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again, see You tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy, suicidal head-case
But You specialize in dyin', You hear me screamin', ""Father!""
And I'm lyin' here just cryin', so wash me with Your water

I feel for you, but when did you believe you were alone?
You say that spiders crawled inside and made themselves a home
Where light once was
Petrified of who you are and who you have become
You will hide from everyone, denying you need
Someone to exterminate your bones

[Chorus]
Friend, please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
But friend, please don't take your life away from me

[Verse 2]
Living like a ghost, you walk by everyone you know
You say that you're fine, but you have lost your sway and glow
So I stopped by to let you know

[Chorus]
Friend, please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
But friend, please don't take your life away from me

[Bridge]
Would you let me know your plans tonight?
'Cause I just won't let go 'til we both see the light
And I have nothing else, oh, left to say
But I will listen to you all day
Yes, I will

I wanna fall inside your ghost
And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul divided

[Chorus]
Sometimes, we will die
And sometimes, we will fly away
Either way, you're by my side
Until my dyin' days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, ""Don't be afraid""
I said, ""Don't be afraid
We're goin' home""

[Verse 2]
I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless piece of death I've made for you
A mortal rotting piece of song
Will help me carry on, but at least you heard

[Chorus]
Oh, sometimes, we will die
And sometimes, we will fly away
Either way, you're by my side
Until my dyin' days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, ""Don't be afraid""
I said, ""Don't be afraid
We're goin' home""

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Okay)
So the hearse ran out of gas
The passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully planned taxi cab
A cab, had a cleared out back
And two men started to unpack
Driving once again, but now this time, there were three men
And then I heard one of them say
""I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day""
And then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more, pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searchin' for
Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked, ""Am I alive and well
Or am I dreaming dead?""
Then one turned around to say
""We're driving toward the morning, son
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone""
[Outro]
I said, ""Don't be afraid""
I said, ""Don't be afraid""
Oh, oh63Embed"
