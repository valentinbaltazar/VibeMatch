You were lookin for your car keys
Rich kids and bob marley
Yeah, they’re never any fun

So we drove out to the ocean
Just to finally feel some motion
The waves sounded like explosions
And we counted every one

And you kissed like the queen of california
And it felt like i hadn’t been born

I really miss you, west coast JV
I know you had to get yourself free
I know it gets hard just to breathe sometimes
I’m never gonna forget your namе
I’ll never see the world quitе the same
I’ll always keep a part of your dreams with mine
With mine

You and me, we’re different pages
Torn out of the same book
My parents they just gave up
And yours wore each other down

I know you had to get yourself free
I know it gets hard just to breathe sometimes
I’m never gonna forget your name
I’ll never see the world quite the same
I’ll always keep a part of your dreams with mine
With mine

And we hated the way everybody talked
About their father’s money and their summer jobs
Princes and princesses trying to get lost
In german cars that their parents bought

In the fade and the glow of the summer light
You asked me if i ever felt the pressure to get everything right
To swim the mess, to stay the course
To be someone that they adore
I really miss you west coast JV
I know you wore your heart on your sleeve
And i know it gets hard just to breathe sometimes

I’m always gonna call out your name
I’ll never see the world quite the same
I’ll always keep a part of your dreams with mine

I used to lose my mind
When you whispered my name

Used to get lost in the songs that I used to sing
Used to get caught in the rush
Used to burn so bright, used to spend the night
And used to never get enough

[Verse 2]
We used to laugh so easy
We used to give 'em hell
You end up killing all the best parts, baby
Trying to protect yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Used to get lost in thе songs that I used to sing
Used to get caught in thе rush
I used to burn so bright, used to fill the sky
And used to never get enough

[Chorus]
Before the world slammed us shut
Before we knew way too much
Didn't worry about what we didn't understand
Swam out so far didn't see land
Before the brain got involved
When it was heart and that's all

Said you never show your bruises

I’d been living in a lifeboat
Dizzy on the ocean
I couldn’t tell you when i last saw land
I washed up on your doorstep
A servant at the temple
A hail mary from a drowning man

And it felt romantic to learn a new language
Desperate & damaged and aching to be
Yeah you came on like the queen of chaos
Like some unsolvable mystery

Your daddy made a living
Sеlling jesus & the manger
Salvation in thе land of sin
And every time that you got me
In a vulnerable position
Well you told me that i looked like him

And you’re never gonna let
Anybody stand beside you

Cause you’re good at telling stories
And talking revolution
And using people
’til they disappear

A goddess when you get what you wanted
And when you don’t my love, you’re mean

Like a breeze, in the summer heat

Well, my brother he got kicked out of school
Yeah, my mom threw him out
And my sister, she lives three streets over
And two houses down
And my father is buried in town
By his father’s side
And me, i spent my whole damn life
Just trying to hide a boston accеnt

Lit like angels

Back in your boston bed

And when the sun is getting lower
And your wildest days are done
And they ask you about a photograph
From back when you were young
Well baby, you don’t have to tell ‘em
What you did when we were us
But when you think about it
I hope you blush, just a little bit
When you think about it, i hope you blush
Just a little bit
When you think about it, i hope you blush

When i play it back, it’s like a movie
And all the best parts still move me
Yeah you gotta admit we looked good back then
Always sneaking off from the party
Everybody knew it didn’t matter
We were burning like a blue flame in a furnace
I could have powered the city every time you kissed me

Of murderous strike and misery

And when I find it, I know I'll make sense of me

No need for Lucifer to fall if he'd learn to keep his mouth shut

Just sitting next to a mortal makes their skin crawl

Hire a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer, we are dream
I could write it better than you've ever felt it

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
A remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it

Do you remember when we met?
The first thing that you said
""I'm done with men they all let me down""
We built an island in the flood
Found the highest ground we could
Spent years in love, we're done with that now

[Refrain 1]
Sometimes the good can go forever
Sometimes you fight to stay together
Sometimes the things that used to save you, don't anymore

[Chorus]
So let's get drunk and stay out all night
Let's get high as the stars, close as shadows
One round of coffee and one last good bye
You and I are gonna see the sunrise
It's just gonna be from different beds next time

[Verse 2]
We took your brother's Cadillac
Drove 'til we ran out of gas
Then we hitch hiked back
From Brooklyn to Queens
He said he almost called the cops
He was pissed at you for months
We just laughed until we both couldn't breath

So sure nobody could touch us
So sure we show 'em all what love was
So sure we'll always be enough
Guess we were wrong

[Chorus]
So let's get drunk and stay out all night
Let's get high as the stars, close as shadows
One round of coffee and one last good bye
You and I are gonna see the sunrise
It's just gonna be from different beds next time

[Bridge]
Sometimes the things you love don't love you back
Sometimes the things you love don't love you back

[Chorus]
So let's get drunk and stay out all night
Let's get high as the stars, close as shadows
One round of coffee and one last good bye

We lay together and watch the sky turn on
Sirens come in waves up the fire escape
Every shadow disappearing into dawn

Ooh, let's keep this going

I fell asleep
Had a dream Bill Murray and I were friends
We drove the world, from Boston to Japan
Blasting old Van Halen and one night over drinks, Bill started crying
He said to me, ""Kid,""
""Of all the stupid things I ever did""
""You know, I let go when I should've pulled her in""
And he handed me his cell phone
But when I called, you were on a plane
Moving back to Portland for the rain

[Chorus]
I won't only love you when you're winning
Other fools pretend to understand
Come on, take my hand and we'll go down swinging
Let me be your man
Let me be your man

[Verse 2]
A hundred days we hiked the coast of Galway in the rain
And Bill said something late one night in Spain
And it's always just stuck with me
""You only get one person knows you best""
""And it's temporary, everybody else""

Half read books, and bold declarations
There was so much I didn't believe in
And then, there was you
You made me brave
You made me stupid
Gave me this skin, that I could move in
We're gonna leave them where they stand
Leave them where they

Love, no one cares
About the stories they're not in
We'll fade out to whispers
It's the last days of summer in San Francisco

The kitchens cold and the tea kettle whistles
The J Church rolls and rattles our windows
There's no nostalgia here it's just now
Baby now
I was a fire that you started
For once I knew everything that I wanted
We're gonna leave them where they stand
Leave them where they

Get winks from the pretty boys down in The Castro
Through the turnstiles roll the chappy girls and the shabby dolls

In disappointment

Laughed when she said it
Flat on our backs in the grass
Out at chrissy field

My life's a movie
My whole life's a movie
If movie's made you wanna
Jump off of a bridge
She said 'I got one who moves me
And one who sees through me

And started tyin' tighter knots

And the night won't turn

With ghosts who wait on luck to come

Tell me this is paradise
And not some place I fell
'Cause I keep on fallin' down

I wanna feel the capsize

I wanna let go and know

And take me deep out past the lights, where

In the static far away

All day 'til the streetlights came on

What happened to feeling cheap radio songs
What happened to thinking that the world was flat
What happened

So up on 59th steet right before the rains
Lovers catching taxis going downtown
I'm talking to what's left of you
I'm watching what I say
Counting all the freckles on your perfect face
You open your window, I sit on your bed
Just waiting for right words to come

Some band's playing hallelujah
Hallelujah
In the corner love
All night girls drink wine and try to sing along
I made a mess of things
The stops and in betweens
They weigh me down
You got someone new singing you your songs now

Sooner surrender
Then watch the last wall collapse
And sooner surrender
And our love will count for everything

In my sweetest dreams
It's just you and me
And we break wide
I wake reminded love
How I just gave up
And how you moved on, how you moved on

I'm waiting for something
I've waited for now
For the rolling canyons of love
And i'm tongue tied
And you're coming alive, coming alive

I tasted, tasted love so sweet
And all of it was lost on me
Bought and sold like property
Sugar on my tongue
I kept falling over
I kept looking backward
I went broke believing
That the simple should be hard

All we are we are
All we are we are
And every day is a start of something beautiful

I wasted, wasted love for you
Traded out for something new
Well, it's hard to change the way you lose
If you think you've never won

It's a cruel world, but I'm a lucky boy

You're so glorious, a waste of time

You are radiator heat, you're the winter blankets sleep

And start waiting for the sky to fall

Twisted in the heat...

I wonder if you're still defending

Cause you've been so wrong
For so long now

Met someone with your eyes and skin
I can convince her of ANYTHING
And baby, it's so delicious you should
Come here and see for yourself
""I'm gone"", you said, ""if this is all there is'
You'll never shine alone

And I wonder if you're still defending

If I can fall away)

Searching for somewhere to hide
And in the end she said it was memorable and comfortable
But funny, I wouldn't have used those words

Oh princess open your eyes and close your mouth
Else all that spite you swallow willingly , it just might fall out

There's nobody around
Just the sounds of the cars
Upon the asphalt ground
It's the waiting time
When the hours grow still
I gaze on through the glass
Inside my windowsill
Though I know that you must be
Somewhere in this world
In this place where, at birth
You and I were both hurled
To think that we once were relating
Is a thing that has almost grown foreign to me

It's a bad sight
Such a terrible waste
To spend your time talking
In such bad taste
It's the same old line
Though it's not you I blame
It's your teachers and television
That you put to shame
The night's lasting longer
Because I've filled my head
With the things I could have done
And the words I could have said
But, in truth, I was only spectating
And that's a permanent part of reality

With the dawn's early light
And the end has arrived
Of this long night
I turn off the television
And I hit the bed
While your shade is still haunting
My ever-vulnerable head
And there's no use
In trying to compromise
When the kindest things we say
But it's time I should quit my complaining
And behave with a little more dignity

Sweet, sweet boy
She promised warmth too, but I knew better
Her words broke hot against my neck
And tasting the sweet, sweet numb of regret on my lips
I filled my pockets and closed the door
And I tasted all I'd left behind, but shameful I crawled naked
Searching for somewhere to hide
And in the end she said it was memorable and comfortable
But funny, I wouldn't have used those words
The secrecy and her bed, it was choking me with a knot in my gut
You have beautiful empty eyes, I'm sure of that much
Oh princess open your eyes and close your mouth
Else all that spite you swallow willingly , it just might fall out
And I've seen you smile wide, I've seen you at your best
And it left me feeling sick inside and unimpressed

But that can wait cuz I'd rather have you here while I can

About other lovers running out of words to say to each other

Would never happen to you and me
So here we sit in silence, searching our heads for common ground
We've rehashed the past and beaten it down
Left us with nothing, no present, no future
I still read your letter and all that evil makes me sick
But this is regimented pain and it gives me the illusion
That I have lived
I was the one that pushed you off the pedestal I put you on
And with my arms still outstretched I watched you fall
And break apart like glass on the highway
I realized my mistake a bit too late because I'd never risk
Picking up the pieces
Look at them all
I'd never risk picking up all those goddamn pieces
Because I lose control at the site of my own blood

That I was wrong and you were right
And that all my attempts were in vain

I'm full of contradictions and hypocrisies
I'm so tired I don't even know which side of the fighting I'm on
And if I wanted no part of it, you d say I was doing something
Wrong
Today was just like yesterday and the day before
I've been taking myself so goddamn seriously and I can't
Recall what for
I can t feel the sunshine anymore
I'm so tired of bitching to myself and wrapping up my
Emotions to please everyone else
I'm so tired of bitching at all because life becomes so cynical
When You're waiting to fall
And I'm waiting to fall
Today was just like yesterday and the day before
I've been taking myself so goddamn seriously and I can't
Recall what for
I can t feel the sunshine anymore
I'm so inspired but you know short-lived inspiration can be
I'll brag about my self-improvement which just ends up lost
Inside of me
I've no faith in justice, corrupted by wealth
And I've no faith in my peers, only a fading faith inside myselfSee Matt Nathanson LiveGet tickets as low as $21You might also likeEmbed"

My words are my words, nothing more

I worship too
But disciples are such useless vessels
Empty and scarred and ready to receive

I brush their dust off my pedestal and through the cloud I've
Kicked up I can just make out your face
In a world of plastic people, I know You're real
I'm just a confused child, a ball of raw emotions shouting my
Hollow threats at you
I'll kick and I'll scream and I'll call you names
But when my storm blows over you ll always hold me the
Same
In a world full of bullshit emotions, I know you feel
I can fall far away from my judgments
I can fall far away from my ignorance
When you cradle me in your arms
In a world of plastic people, I know You're real
In a world of bullshit emotions, I know you feel
Under blankets, under the shelter of your skin, you warm me
From within
I never want to leave your arms for this long againSee Matt Nathanson LiveGet tickets as low as $21You might also likeEmbed"

One night in Iowa, you and I, in a borrowed car
Went driving in the summer, promises on every star
Out in the distance, I could hear some people laughing
I felt my heart beat back a weekend's worth of sadness
There was a farmhouse that had long since been deserted
We stopped and carved our hearts into the wooden surface
We thought just for an instant we could see the future
We thought for once we knew what really was important

[Chorus]
Coming up closе, everything sounds like
Wеlcome home, come home
And oh, by the way, don't you know that I could make
A dream that's barely half awake come true?
I wanted to say, but anything I could've said
It felt somehow, you already knew

[Verse 2]
We got back in the car and listened to a Dylan tape
We drove around the fields until it started getting late
And I went back to my hotel room on the highway
And you just got back in your car and drove away

[Chorus]
Coming up close, everything sounds like
Welcome home, come home
And oh, by the way, don't you know that I could make
A dream that's barely half awake come true?
I wanted to say, but anything I could've said
I felt somehow, you already knew
