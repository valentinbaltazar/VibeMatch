And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here

The bearded weirdy's just arrived

Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force

So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

We still sit at separate tables
And we sleep at different times
And the warm wind in the palm trees
Hasn't helped to change our minds
It was the lure of the tropics
That I thought might heal the scars
Of a love burned out by silence
In a marriage minus heart

[Pre-Chorus]
And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year

[Chorus 1]
The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year?

[Verse 2]
I dreamed of love in a better climate
And for what it's really worth
I put faith in the star we followed
To this Caribbean surf
But there's an icy fringe on everything
And I cannot find the lines
Where's the beauty in the beast we made
Why the frost in the summertime

On a hill long ago, on a cold winter's night
In a land far away, three kings saw a light
And from Heaven, it shone like God's, God's own crown
And it guided three kings into Bethlehem town

[Verse 2: Joss Stone]
Oh, they came bearing gifts and so said each one
""Let's call this day Christmas from this moment on""
""We'll be calling it Christmas in, in honour of Him""
""The Child in the manger, our Savior and King"", oh

[Chorus: Elton John, Joss Stone, Both]
We've been calling it Christmas
Keeping the faith
Knowing the reason
We, we're saving the day
We've been calling it, we've been calling it Christmas (Oh)
Down through the years (Down through the years, baby)
Spreading joy to the world
When Christmas is here, is here

[Verse 3: Elton John, Joss Stone]

At the back of an inn where, where shepherds and kings
First felt the joy that this moment would bring

(Hold me closer)
(Hold me closer)
(Hold me closer)
(Hold me closer)

[Verse 1: Elton John & Britney Spears, Elton John]
I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands (Oh)

[Chorus: Elton John & Britney Spears, Britney Spears]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today, oh

[Post-Chorus: Elton John & Britney Spears]
Hold me closer
Hold me closer (Hold me closer)

Even when my eyes are closed
Uncertain of a lot of things
But with you, I've always known
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Cryin' about somebody, tell her
Somebody come pass an umbrella
Fucked this bitch inside the 'tella
I had to take the call, past the tele'
I bought you Gucci, baby, Mais' Margiela
You can get a new one, but he won't be better
Straight to the top and don't need no propeller
Oh, I've been all outside with the fellas
Take me back, I can put you in control if you take me back
Goodfella, roll in a new Maybach
She been fuckin' me good and I'm hooked like crack
Make sure you ballin', don't worry 'bout nothin'
You keep on goin' forward and never look back
You bring me luck just like 7-Eleven
And just for that, I'ma give you some racks, let you splurge
Mama, what's the word?
All I do is flirt, just do it like a verb
Takin' off your skirt, this the night I make you squirt
Pull up to the tele', watch me murk you with no dirt
Bet you never leave

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I never thought you would end up as the enemy
I always thought you'd be right here, still defending me
I feel so bad for you, lost your identity
Made your decision, there's a penalty
It's so hard for me to understand
(It's so hard for me to understand)
I guess the universe had different plans
(I guess the universe had different plans)
I put my love, I put my love in your hands
In your hands
But that was so you
You had to leave, I had to go too
I could always tell that you had no clue
You never understood what I had to go through
But then, I guess somewhere deep inside, we both knew
So the memories is what I'll toast to
'Cause in the past life when everything felt right
You used to know me (And I got to know you)
Once upon a time when we rolled out
But now, baby, oh, no, you sold out
[Chorus: Elton John & Young Thug]

Refresh your memory of where you wanna be

In a sky made of diamonds

As an old man, I'm a young man
'Cause I've not been old for long
And before these trembling waters settle
I'll have flown the pond
So I don't mean to be morbid
Or a bit too on the nose
But I'd like to share a few things
That I've learned along the road

[Refrain: Elton John & Brandi Carlile]
What you'll find chasing dreams
Is the finish line recedes
And a riddle stays a riddle
Oh, the humor's bittersweet

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John & Brandi Carlile, Elton John]
All nature does is dance
So when you dance, you're in accord
Look no further than the feeling
That it gives you for reward
Reward (Reward)

Hard to learn
Fire is hot
Burn, burn, burn

There was a time when I was feeling incomplete
Lost in the shadow of the person I could be
Chasing perfection in every direction, so focused on the end
I didn't see the journey and take in every step

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmie Allen]
Every long road
Song that I half-wrote
Brought me to where I am

[Chorus: Jimmie Allen]
Every root turns into branches
Every question leads to answers
Even if the seed ain’t fully grown
There's beauty in the bones
Just a drop can start a riptide
Just a word can change a whole life
Even if this story ain't been wrote
There’s beauty in the bones

I'm still here, but yet I'm gone
I don't play guitar or sing my songs
They never defined who I am
The man that loves you 'til the end

[Pre-Chorus: Glen Campbell]
You're the last person I will love
You're the last face I will recall
And best of all

[Chorus: Glen Campbell]
I'm not gonna miss you
Not gonna miss you

[Verse 2: Elton John]
I'm never gonna hold you like I did
Or say ""I love you"" to the kids
You're never gonna see it in my eyes
It's not gonna hurt me when you cry

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
I'm never gonna know what you go through
All the things I say or do
All the hurt and all the pain
One thing selfishly remains

Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Elton John]
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran & Elton John]
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all
Spare a thought for the ones who have gone?

Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

[Pre-Chorus]
But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town

He makes a lot, they say
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said ""God is dead
And the War's begun""
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

With the smell of woodsmoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
Oh, I went to see my chieftain
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said
I can't believe our Warlord's dead
Oh, he would not leave the chosen ones
To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns

Oh, great father of the Iroquois
Ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke
And breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftain's daughter mine

And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?
You might also likeI take only what is mine, Lord
My pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die
Along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run

Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead

Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Comes with a bullet hole1Embed"

If it came to pass
That they should ask
What could I tell them?
Would they criticize
Behind my back
Maybe I should let them

[Chorus]
Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

[Verse 2]
If they could face it
I could take it
In their eyes
Oh, I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it

[Chorus]
Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man
You might also like[Bridge]
But I know the way
They want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn
Their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man

[Outro]
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul

The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine only when it starts to rain

And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs

For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon

I'm sorry I took your time

There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know

Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You'd better get your coat dear
It looks like rain

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water

I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back

But is it in your conscience that you're after

Said lady, that's the way
You've gotta rock me when he's gone
You make me feel like a diesel train going home
We got so much to give each other
And we've only just begun
So take me baby, break me lady
Gotta rock me when he's gone

To make you laugh I've stood knee-deep in mud outside your door

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
Now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
There's Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
She just laughs, turning back
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the song
The words she knows, the tune she hums

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
You might also like[Chorus]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen

Hold me closer, tiny dancer

Warm the wine and give it to me one more time again
I'm just a rolling stone who needs a drop of rain
And to taste your honey, Mona, is like licking on the Sun
My truck's hid in the backyard so come here and give me some

[Chorus]
Lady, that's the way you've gotta rock me when he's gone
You make me feel like a diesel train going home
We got so much to give each other and we've only just begun
So take me baby, break me lady, gotta rock mе when he's gone

[Verse 2]
Brеak the bread in two and you can give me half
I've ridden hard and fast just to make you laugh
To make you laugh, I've stood knee-deep in mud outside your door
Clutching in my hand a border rose from Baltimore

[Chorus]
Lady, that's the way you've gotta rock me when he's gone
You make me feel like a diesel train going home
We got so much to give each other and we've only just begun
So take me baby, break me lady, gotta rock me when he's gone
I said, lady, that's the way you've gotta rock me when he's gone
You make me feel like a diesel train going home
We got so much to give each other and we've only just begun
So take me baby, break me lady, gotta rock me when he's gone
You might also like[Hook]
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, rock me when he's gone
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, rock me when he's gone
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, rock me when he's gone
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me when he's gone
Alright!

Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, rock me when he's gone

Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, rock me when he's gone
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, rock me when he's gone

Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Elton John]
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran & Elton John]
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all
Spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

[Refrain: Choir]

I will always love you

I will always see you
Even when my eyes are closed
Uncertain of a lot of things
But with you, I've always known
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
Even if you let me go

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Cryin' about somebody, tell her
Somebody come pass an umbrella
Fucked this bitch inside the 'tella
I had to take the call, past the tele'
I bought you Gucci, baby, Mais' Margiela
You can get a new one, but he won't be better
Straight to the top and don't need no propeller
Oh, I've been all outside with the fellas
Take me back, I can put you in control if you take me back
Goodfella, roll in a new Maybach
She been fuckin' me good and I'm hooked like crack
Make sure you ballin', don't worry 'bout nothin'
You keep on goin' forward and never look back
You bring me luck just like 7-Eleven
And just for that, I'ma give you some racks, let you splurge
Mama, what's the word?
All I do is flirt, just do it like a verb
Takin' off your skirt, this the night I make you squirt
Pull up to the tele', watch me murk you with no dirt
Bet you never leave

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I never thought you would end up as the enemy
I always thought you'd be right here, still defending me
I feel so bad for you, lost your identity
Made your decision, there's a penalty
It's so hard for me to understand
(It's so hard for me to understand)
I guess the universe had different plans
(I guess the universe had different plans)
I put my love, I put my love in your hands
In your hands
But that was so you
You had to leave, I had to go too
I could always tell that you had no clue
You never understood what I had to go through
But then, I guess somewhere deep inside, we both knew
So the memories is what I'll toast to
'Cause in the past life when everything felt right
You used to know me (And I got to know you)
Once upon a time when we rolled out
But now, baby, oh, no, you sold out
[Chorus: Elton John & Young Thug]
I will always love you
Even when I say I don't (Even when I say I don't)

I tried to tell you that I love you but I'm choked up
You forgot and that makes me feel like no one (Summer lines)
Were you ever really there? Did you ever really care?
Wait, I got so many examples of all of the good times we had
Long summer nights (Summer lines)
Held you long time, put your name in my rhyme
Refresh your memory of where you wanna be
The phantom's on the way, she’s coming down the street

On a peach blossom highway
I tried to put these pauses out of mind
In a sky made of diamonds
Where the world fell silent
I'll be waiting for you on the other side

When I look back upon my life
It's always with a sense of shame

For everything I long to do

Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school, they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed

As an old man, I'm a young man
'Cause I've not been old for long
And before these trembling waters settle
I'll have flown the pond
So I don't mean to be morbid
Or a bit too on the nose
But I'd like to share a few things
That I've learned along the road

[Refrain: Elton John & Brandi Carlile]
What you'll find chasing dreams
Is the finish line recedes
And a riddle stays a riddle
Oh, the humor's bittersweet

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John & Brandi Carlile, Elton John]
All nature does is dance
So when you dance, you're in accord
Look no further than the feeling
That it gives you for reward
Reward (Reward)
Reward

Hard to learn
Fire is hot

There was a time when I was feeling incomplete
Lost in the shadow of the person I could be
Chasing perfection in every direction, so focused on the end
I didn't see the journey and take in every step

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmie Allen]
Every long road
Song that I half-wrote
Brought me to where I am

[Chorus: Jimmie Allen]
Every root turns into branches
Every question leads to answers
Even if the seed ain’t fully grown
There's beauty in the bones
Just a drop can start a riptide
Just a word can change a whole life
Even if this story ain't been wrote
There’s beauty in the bones

Every long road
Song that I half-wrote
Brought me where I am

We broke the rules together
I'm guilty for the crime
You call me up at 3 AM
To kill me one more time
We’re dancing in slow motion
The house is set on fire
We hurt the ones we love the most
Tempted by desire

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John & Stevie Nicks]
Smoke rings, tattoos, warning signs
Sink your teeth in, babe, be mine

[Chorus: Elton John & Stevie Nicks, Elton John, Stevie Nicks]
Our love was like a stolen car
Racing down the freeway
Drinking for a new day
Wasted in an old dive bar
Nobody knew our names
Damn, thosе were the good days
Oh, wе knew that it wouldn't last
But we did it to remember
Our love was like a stolen car
Pulled over on the freeway
'Cause it was never ours

You're always gone too soon

Straight to the top and don't need no propeller
Oh, I've been all outside with the fellas
Take me back, I can put you in control if you take me back
Goodfella, roll in a new Maybach
She been fuckin' me good and I'm hooked like crack
Make sure you ballin', don't worry 'bout nothin'
You keep on goin' forward and never look back
You bring me luck just like 7-Eleven
And just for that, I'ma give you some racks, let you splurge
Mama, what's the word?

Takin' off your skirt, this the night I make you squirt
Pull up to the tele', watch me murk you with no dirt

Made your decision, there's a penalty

I guess the universe had different plans

I put my love, I put my love in your hands
In your hands
But that was so you
You had to leave, I had to go too
I could always tell that you had no clue
You never understood what I had to go through
But then, I guess somewhere deep inside, we both knew
So the memories is what I'll toast to
'Cause in the past life when everything felt right
You used to know me (And I got to know you)
Once upon a time when we rolled out
But now, baby, oh, no, you sold out

Wait, I got so many examples of all of the good times we had
Long summer nights (Summer lines)
Held you long time, put your name in my rhyme
Refresh your memory of where you wanna be
The phantom's on the way, she’s coming down the street

On a peach blossom highway
I tried to put these pauses out of mind
In a sky made of diamonds
Where the world fell silent
I'll be waiting for you on the other side

Seems to me, I'm in a dream (Long summer nights, held you long time)

Behind these summer lines (Of where you wanna be, the phantom's on the way)

'Cause I've not been old for long
And before these trembling waters settle
I'll have flown the pond
So I don't mean to be morbid
Or a bit too on the nose
But I'd like to share a few things
That I've learned along the road

What you'll find chasing dreams
Is the finish line recedes
And a riddle stays a riddle
Oh, the humor's bittersweet

So when you dance, you're in accord
Look no further than the feeling
That it gives you for reward

There was a time when I was feeling incomplete
Lost in the shadow of the person I could be
Chasing perfection in every direction, so focused on the end
I didn't see the journey and take in every step

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmie Allen]
Every long road
Song that I half-wrote
Brought me to where I am

[Chorus: Jimmie Allen]
Every root turns into branches
Every question leads to answers
Even if the seed ain’t fully grown
There's beauty in the bones
Just a drop can start a riptide
Just a word can change a whole life
Even if this story ain't been wrote
There’s beauty in the bones

We broke the rules together
I'm guilty for the crime
You call me up at 3 AM
To kill me one more time
We’re dancing in slow motion
The house is set on fire
We hurt the ones we love the most
Tempted by desire

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John & Stevie Nicks]
Smoke rings, tattoos, warning signs
Sink your teeth in, babe, be mine

[Chorus: Elton John & Stevie Nicks, Elton John, Stevie Nicks]
Our love was like a stolen car
Racing down the freeway
Drinking for a new day
Wasted in an old dive bar
Nobody knew our names
Damn, thosе were the good days
Oh, wе knew that it wouldn't last
But we did it to remember
Our love was like a stolen car
Pulled over on the freeway
'Cause it was never ours

You're always gone too soon

The stale perfume yeah, and the beer canteens
My first impression was to get outside
But then I saw you crying, crying by the fireside

The pendulum swings
Going to and fro
And the clock goes round
Says it's time to go
And the clock goes round
And the hours fly past
Slow down pendulum you're moving much too fast

There's a picture in the nursery
Of a well know soldier man
And he wants to be like father
When he grows up if he can
His eyes survey the floorboards
With his soldiers around him
But, fear not for the future
You will climb the highest mountain

[Chorus]
So, Regimental Sergeant Zippo
Stand up to attention will you
(Regimental Sergeant Zippo)
Hear the bugle sound in the morning call up rising
(Regimental Sergeant Zippo)
So, you're cardboard castle is standing
You're the one who is commanding
Watch them march along the landing down the stairs

[Verse 2]
He's just a small boy in a small boys world
And small boys do strange things
He likes to see the matchsticks fly
And hear the cannons ring
For his eiderdown, his battlefield
And in his dreams his fights are real
Until the field is won, aim fire the guns

This is the news
One, two, three, four

The grass in Ashfield Park is dying
Where everybody dreams of deeds of crime
And the tartan coloured lady walks
Behind the water colours of my mind
And the tartan coloured lady she's mine

People speak of willow trees in autumn
And my clove-key doesn't fit her anymore
And the tartan coloured Lady that I wanted
Talked of this place, an hour or so before
And the tartan coloured lady lost her dog

So if your crystal window isn't broken
And thеy've taken all the dustbins from your door
Takе yourself the tartan coloured lady
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more

So I guess I'll read the comic books you've left me
And play marbles on the floor
And if the tartan coloured lady calls me
Just tell her I won't be home 'til four
Oh just tell her, I won't be home no more

Watching the planes go by

The windows open, the curtains blow
Round my room where the lights are low
I stand in darkness and watch the stars
Wondering just how far you are from me

I'm out here
You're somewhere
Somewhere out there
Too far from me

And I want it to be
Like it was when the summer was here
Instead of just sitting here
Watching the planes go by

The street lamp look lonely
I wonder, I wonder if it feels like me
With no one to love him
And no one to talk to
When she's out there moving
Without thinking 'bout me

On a back road in the pines
If it's round just like a medal
On a tired old man of war
Or hidden like that Burma Star
In my dad's bottom drawer

Look at you in your monkey suit
Driving south, nothing left to prove
You come back here in your cowboy boots
Dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Every pose you strike, every frame they shoot
Shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit

Build your ladder to the moon
Beat on that sacred drum
Trample on the hands of those
That cling to every rung
Every seed you crush beneath
Like stone ground in a mill

Restless were my eyes
Insane, they took the paddles
My arms they paralyzed

So where to now, St. Peter?
If it's true, I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now, St. Peter?
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report
Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change

Beyond the rifle range

Some punk with a shotgun killed young Danny Bailey
In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel
Killed him in anger, a force he couldn't handle
Helped pull the trigger that cut short his life
And there's not many knew him the way that we did
Sure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most hungry kids?

Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead, oh
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in

We're running short of heroes back up here in the hills
Without Danny Bailey, we're gonna have to break up our stills
So mark his grave well 'cause Kentucky loved him
Born and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him
And he found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by
A running gun youngster in a sad restless age

""It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us it's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes""

[Verse 2]
The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Somethin' happened
It's so strange this feelin'
Naïve notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

[Chorus]
Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we?
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Strugglin' through the day
When even your best friend says
""Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?""

Six o'clock alarm
I get the wake up call
Let that sucker jingle-jangle
Ring right off the wall
I'm too low for zero
I'm too tired to work
Tied one on with a friend last night
And wound up losing my shirt

[Chorus]
I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

[Verse 2]
Cutting out cups of coffee
Switching off the late night news
Putting the cat out two hours early
It isn't any use
I'm too low for zero
Insomnia attacks
Watching flies with my eyes till sunrise
It's daylight when I hit the sack

I have sold myself through and through
I have walked in the darkness too
Felt a red sun, the living proof
Washed my hands in the honest truth
I have carried this weight time after time
I have bettered the dumb and the blind
I've seen dignity fail and colors run
Seen justice denied by the voice of a gun

[Chorus]
And we walk, yes we walk
And we walk with the power every day
Never letting the light slip away
Reaching out, reaching in
Touching truth and touching skin
Never letting the light slip away
And we walk with the power every day

[Verse 2]
If my faith is a fire then burn baby burn
We've held fire long enough to learn
Heat beneath hope is a healing light
Kept alive by the flames of night
Walk tall in the power day after day
Never, never, never lose sight of the way
See the dawn come and the dusk hang
See the power rise from an open hand

Breaking down never seems to be that hard
Falling short is always in the cards
I'm on the road, sunrise is at my back
Lost it all somewhere between the cracks
I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we deliver
Then there are the lucky ones

[Chorus]
And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me, I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, thankful
I'm thankful, so thankful
I'm thankful, I've got all that I'm allowed

Leaving town gets to feel just like a job
My desire never winds up on top
I can say now I didn't want the moon

And every one of us that ever came to play
Has to cross the bridge or fade away

Seen so many jump, never seen one saved
On a distant beach your song can die
On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide

Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light

Don't want its shadow anymore

A man grows bitter
We're a bitter race
Some of us never get to see

In the Northern Skies
There was a steel cloud
It used to follow me around
But I don't see it now
There's a farm in the rain
And a little farmhouse
There were a young man's eyes
Looking south

[Chorus 1]
The North was my mother
But I no longer need her
You trade your roots and your dust
For a face in the river

And a driven rain that washes you
To a different shore

""An extremely quiet child"" they called you in your school report
""He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught""
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died?

[Verse 2]
At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
""Oh, he's unconcerned with competition, he never cares to win""
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son

[Chorus]
""Now you'll never get to Heaven,"" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
""Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed""
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

[Verse 3]
They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said, ""His brain's just snapped"" then someone called the police
You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh, you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground

A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed

""Don't ever ride on the devil's knee,"" Mama said

""Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread""
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male Caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule

[Verse 6]
Oh, they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
""Throw out your gun, walk out slow, just keep your hands held high""
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh, you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law

We're caught up in a web, you and I
Since Crystal came between us
The knots of friendship seem to be untied
And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie
She can swing us both forever
In the long run she's the one who must decide

[Chorus]
And if she leaves me handle her with care
Don't hurt little Crystal
And if she calls you long distance just be there
Oh Crystal
The world is your oyster, you're a pearl
But he's a jewel and my friend
I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl
Oh Crystal

[Verse 2]
You're stronger than me but I'm sure
That the fight would fall to no one
The cold hard truth is stronger than us all
And it breaks my heart to see us go this far
We're just captives in our separate cells
And without her there's no peace behind these bars

Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force

See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

There's a dusty old gutter he's lying in now
Mmm, He's blind and he's old
And there's a bottle that rolls down the road
Me, I'm young and I'm so wild
And I still feel the need
Of your apron strings once in a while
For there's taxi cabs a-hooting
But I can't be foot-loose forever
My suitcase it's a cheap one
My darling, she's a dear one
My head's feeling light as a feather

[Chorus]
Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows

[Verse 2]
Part of me asked the young man for the time
With a cool vacant stare
Of undue concern, he said nine
It's not so bad but I really do love the land
And rather all this than those diamante lovers
In Hyde Park holding hands
Blowing heat through my fingers
Trying to kill off this cold
Will the street kids remember?
Can I still shoot a fast cue?
Has this country kid still got his soul?

Through nights all alone
Well you're tougher than leather
No old burlap sack
Not some hard scrabble weeds
Growing up through the cracks

Beats sun shining down

No skinny old tack
You're still sharp as a razor

We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment
On Orlando and 4th
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
Like a Chinese proverb
We were always searching
Nightlife's a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes

[Chorus]
And the tears never came
They just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growing
Like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the emperor's new clothes

[Verse 2]
We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly
We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperor's new clothes

Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game
He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a Greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus

[Chorus]
And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
Gonna go west to the sea
The Greyhound is swaying
And the radio's playing
Some blues for baby and me
And the highway looks like it never did
Lord, it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me

[Verse 2]
Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
I called you my child, said honey now this is our game
There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again

I put my life on hold and took you home
Good sense shot down I placed you on a throne
Where was the wheel that kept me on the road
The force of nature preventing overload
So don't you know I've been dressed to kill
If you got the tools be careful what you build
When the arrow's in the bull's-eye every time
It's hard assuming that the archer's blind

[Chorus]
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

[Verse 2]
I was full of foreign notions at the start
There was never once
When I was off my guard
For any ghost of every poet in the ground
There's one like me
To buy the guys a round

I'm going down
You and me together going down
It's not what I'd been told about this town
That when you least expect if you can drown
In quicksand

I've been bottled and been brained
Squealers can't be trusted

Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me
Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
To frighten away all the lost and the lonely
The sacred forgotten of yesterday's problems
Your wooden construction was meant for infliction
To penetrate pain with the thoughts from my mind

Can you see me, scarecrow?
Can you still feel free?
For all your love, scarecrow
And will you still be there tomorrow?
And will you still be there tomorrow?

Like moths around a light bulb, your brain is still bleeding
From visions and pictures of nature's young raincoat
If only my eyes were not pinned to your table
My arms would be grasping the lilac of summer (The lilac of summer)

And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind

With the sleep still in your eyes
You'll see the shadow of the sun above my mind
For the sea of tears is drowning me

I know that only you can help me now

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yestеrday has gone
And a dandelion dies in thе wind

But a dandelion sighs
And it tries to tell the wind
That crying's not a bad thing
But worrying is a sin
If they sent a cloud from heaven
I would ride into the skies
To escape all of my troubles
And to cast away your lies

I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race

And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise
The bearded weirdy's just arrived

My vision's blurred with colour, and all he sees is red
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the roomYou might also likeEmbed"

This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, heh

Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song

Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man

Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got

Learning fast as the weeks went past

Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord, I miss Daniel
Oh, I miss him so much

It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

You know you can't hold me forever

I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singin' the blues

Ah, ah-ah ah ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm goin' back to my plough
Back to the howlin' old owl in the woods
Huntin' the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

We can share the troubles we already know

Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?

Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)

Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough
Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carvin' up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me, let's a-call it quits

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction

Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

All this time I’ve spent bein' someone else’s friend
Just one more time, for old time’s sake, I’d like to go back home again

The world had seven wonders once upon a time
It’s sure enough the favoured nations aided their decline
And all around me, I’ve seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I’d say amen if I could get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I’d never left, I’d never have known

Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again

Could've been a jailbreak and the spotlight hittin' me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia on the coast of Spain
Never tirin' once of hearin' songs about goin' home again

I've figured out where I went wrong
The script not followed then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not actin' up

[Verse 2]
I've worn the world upon my back
Would someone else but me pick up the slack?
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

[Chorus]
Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

[Verse 3]
Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinkin' 'bout
Time is wasted lookin' back

[Chorus]
Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

It's dark and deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear

Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinkin', step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
Some say, ""Eat or be eaten""
Some say, ""Live and let live""
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

[Chorus]
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

[Verse 2]
Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin' high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

[Verse 2]
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinkin' of the ways that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

[Refrain]
For just a skyline pigeon dreamin' of the open
Waitin' for the day that he can spread his wings
And fly away again

[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind

[Verse 3]
Let me wake up in the mornin'
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

Ever since I was a young boy I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton I must've played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

[Post-Chorus]
(How do you think he does it?) I don't know
(What makes him so good?)

Well, he ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells

Always has a replay, never tilts at all

What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden
Among the flagstones there
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect
Can damage so much grain

[Verse 2]
And what's it for?
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk
Nothin' grows no more
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed
We're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one
No one can replace

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'
""Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?""

Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger
If only he could hear

Now we pray for rain
And with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'

Well, she looked a peach in the dress she made
When she was still her mama's little girl
And when she walked down the aisle, everybody smiled
At her innocence and curls
And when the preacher said, ""Is there anyone here
Got a reason why they shouldn't wed?""

[Pre-Chorus]
I shoulda stuck up my hand
I shoulda got up to stand
And this is what I should have said

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, ""I do"", say, ""bye, bye, bye""
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

[Verse  2]
Underneath her veil, I could see a tear
Tricklin' down her pretty face
And when he slipped on the ring, I knew everything
Would never be the same again
But if the groom woulda known, he'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did

I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand

Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

[Verse 2]
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

[Pre-Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti]
La promessa non fu chiara
S'erra solo impressa in me
Vidi solo il gelo dentro me
Quella notte dise a me

Vivrem comme cavalli
Liberi dai recinti di ferro
Che piu non voglio
Rinnegare i sensi
Su dai fuggiam

We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net

Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate

The someone you once loved so long ago so well

You're holding back
You're hard to read
Your a 21st century kind
You're lighting fast
Built for speed
A tight lipped modern mind
An architect
Of grand romance
You're a mystery of disguise
You're holed up in your house
Just waiting for the fire
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

[Chorus]
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

Look at us fools
Being used
We're totally dumb, surprised
Waiting for you to share with us
The myth behind the lies
Come on out
Throw us a bone
We want to know your intentions
Are you fake
For goodness sake
Or the Mother of Invention
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

[Chorus]
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
You're gonna need a claw hammer

To bust on through

I am the elder Utah Smith
I've got two wings to fly
They may be made of paper
They may never reach the sky
But I believe in mercy
I believe that man is good
And if they want two wings like me
There's a chance they could

[Verse 2]
I am the elder Utah Smith
I was born in Cedar Grove
That's in Louisiana
On a dirt-poor stretch of road
I found the calling early
Gave birth to righteous words
And in a tent around the South
I took my sonic church

[Chorus]
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

I am the elder Utah Smith
I take all as they are
I was the first man of the cloth
To blacken a guitar
Love was my redeemer
I felt it from the start
The Holy Ghost was channeled
Through the sound of my guitar

[Chorus]
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

[Verse 4]
Been a long time in the ground
Unmarked is my grave
But I reside elsewhere these days
Thanks to souls I've saved
I traveled far, I traveled wide
Three quarts for the Lord
Till one day he called me home
To claim his great reward
[Chorus]
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old GIbson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love

Would someone else but me pick up the slack?
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows

The laughter comes as easy as the jokes

Here you went to choose and you're gonna stay
So I knew that's the price I pay

Won't you let me love you

Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

Looking for a clue
Searched the world it's what I used to do
Where I went
What I went though

[Verse 2]
Caught some big ones
Reeled em in
And hung em out to dry
From little fish to bigger things
A welcome push
An empty swing
Given the chance we'd stop to sing
And watch the world go by

[Chorus]
And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America
(England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

Showed our roots from time to time
And used it to ignite
Our wilder side to get up through
To push and pull, and come unglued
Mixture of red wine and blues
That run right through our lives

[Chorus]
And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America
(England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America
(England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can we do
Tears from your little sister
Crying cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
Oh but you know she'll get by

Because she's living

In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's going to buy her a dream to cling to
Mama's going to love her just as much as she can and she can

[Verse 2]
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'll lose it in the snow on the ground
Out walking your dog to find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
You better go home where it's warm

But the closer the knit the tighter the fit

And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
And a [unverified] prayer making you strong
Where you belong

Where you can live

Then I think about the love I have inside me
How you brought what's inside out
Now love's made it to the outside
I want to tell the world of everything I've found
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
You turned my living upside down

[Chorus]
And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels
Is it cloudy, is it bright
Is it day or is it night
Am I wrong or am I right
And is it real

[Verse 2]
Tell me where you learned the magic
The spell you used the day you made me fall
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside down but ten feet tall

[Chorus]

On and on I've drifted with the tide
I didn't know that love could move me so
You fed my life with love and much more besides
And you showed me which way to go

Good morning world, it's a brand new day
I'm packing my bags and I'm going away
I'm moving my legs and my city tired bones
I got to get away from the busy man's phones

Got to make a move where the living is wild and free
If you want to get happy, then people, come along with me

I'm getting [?] looks from the big white man
I got to get away just as fast as I can

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied
Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light colored candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for

Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind
If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel

[Verse 1]
Why's it never light on my lawn?
Why does it rain and never say, ""Good day"" to the newborn?
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 2]
I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal
You might also like[Verse 3]
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

Some punk with a shotgun killed young Danny Bailey
In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel
Killed him in anger, a force he couldn't handle
Helped pull the trigger that cut short his life
And there's not many knew him the way that we did
Sure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most hungry kids?

[Chorus]
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead, oh
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in

[Verse 2]
We're running short of heroes back up here in the hills
Without Danny Bailey, we're gonna have to break up our stills
So mark his grave well 'cause Kentucky loved him
Born and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him
And he found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by
A running gun youngster in a sad restless age

Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead

When I watch the police come by and move you on

I may sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
You draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon

[Chorus]
Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

[Verse 2]
Nine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings
I'd liven the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do any good
Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear
I can hear hoofbeats ahead
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
While the wife and the kids are in bed

My bulldog is barking in the backyard
Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
Disturbance going to crucify my days
And the days they get longer and longer
And the nighttime is a time of little use
For I just get ugly and older
I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose

[Chorus]
And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

[Verse 2]
My landlady lives in a caravan
Well, that is when she isn't in my arms
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
But my liquor also helps to grease her palms
And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Because either way you gonna need it now (now,now,now)

Cry tears of joy so they can see you drown (drown, drown, drown)

Chew you up only to spew you out (out, out, out)
You are now a victim of the in crowd
And music has lost its soul
And the female’s selling sex and no content on getting old
So they concerts aren't as sold
So the concern is on they labels
That we pay them to perform
See, the way this game is set up
We can’t let this show go on, no
Who going to love them when the party’s over
I’m saying everybody love them but nobody know them
I’m saying everybody know you but nobody need you
So will she still be in your heart when she is not in your speakers?

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

[Verse 1]
It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
And a handful of grease in her hair

[Chorus]
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout, ""She's with me""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

[Chorus]
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like

Hair flowing like water
Skin like velvet made
The whole damn world slow down
She was a preacher's daughter
Never did what daddy taught her
And the rebel in her soul
Brought her to me
The river was cold
And the river was wide
She flowed from the mountain
Straight across the great divide
And her heart ran cold
But her love runs deep
She's fire on the mountain
Wrecking everyone she meets
She's like rain when she rolls in
But that sunshine in her thunder
Makes the loneliest heart wonder
If the ride is worth the pain
Might not be stone clouds inside
Oh but don't you worry friend
She's coming around the bend
She's holding lightning in both hands
Lord please know
It's that time for me to go
The river has my heart
She's the keeper of my soul
On one side of the water
Sweet everlasting grace
The other side could end your life
Or steal your breath away
She's like rain when she rolls in
But that sunshine in her thunder
Makes the loneliest heart wonder
If the ride is worth the pain
Might not be stone clouds inside
Oh but don't you worry friend
She's coming around the bend
She's holding lightning in both hands
She's a natural disaster
She'll tear the land in two
She's running to be running
'Cause it's all she knows to do
She's a tumbleweed rolling
A river running wild
A hurricane blowing
She's the calm after the storm
Under an Appalachian sunset sky
She's like rain when she rolls in
But that sunshine in her thunder
Makes the loneliest heart wonder
If the ride is worth the pain
Might not be stone clouds inside
Oh but don't you worry friend
She's coming around the bend
She's holding lightning in both hands

But I don't mind, that's kind of nifty
You always see those break-ups in the movies
And just like a light honey you put me out
Now I'm gonna do my best
To get you back in the nest you came from

You can erase me if you want to
Turn your back in other men
But whenever you're ready
Honey, we'll go steady again

It's nasty without you in my little room
I miss you like crazy, please come back soon

I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
My mother she was a fisherman's wife
She was scrubbing floors most of her life

They said screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use

At the school I attended I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane

They said screw you
Oh you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule

So you see there's man who get paid for being slaves
And men who get paid for being free
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
And all of them say most of the way
Screw you
You might also likeI worked in the mill from seven till nine
Tears in my eyes nearly drove me half-blind
Trying to make wages that weren't even there
Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear

Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

Always has a replay, never tilts at all

I hung out with the old folks
In the hope that I'd get wise
I was trying to bridge the gap
Between the great divide

[Verse 2]
Hung on every recollection
In the theater of their eyes
Picking up on this and that
In the few that still survived

[Chorus]
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

[Verse 3]
They bend like trees in winter
These shuffling old grey lions
Those snow-white stars still gather
Like the belt around Orion
You might also like[Verse 4]
Just to touch the faded lightning
Of their powerful design
Of a generation gathering
For maybe the last time

[Chorus]
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

[Bridge]
Oceans away
Where the green grass sways
And the cool wind blows
Across the shadow of their graves
Shoulder to shoulder back in the day
Sleeping bones to rest in earth, oceans away
Oceans away

[Chorus]
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans awayEmbed"

Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails
Shaking fists and razors gleamed
You never stood a chance
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street
You turned your eyes to France

[Verse 2]
Humbled far from Dublin, chased across the waves
Your biting wit still sharp enough
To slice through every page
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
The bitter pill you swallowed
Tasted sweeter going down

[Chorus 1]
And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone walls
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all

[Verse 3]
A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive
When they paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes
Tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law
Branded Oscar Wilde a sinner
You might also like[Chorus 2]
And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome

[Bridge]
Don't turn around it's a white gull screaming
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
From the stately homes of England to her prisons

And looking back at the hardened lifers
Looking back on the wretched poor
Thinking maybe they were my saviors
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Strange to think I'll miss them all

Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said ""I'm going to keep this good luck
Piece of iron inside my truck""
The boy just whispered ""OK""
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog
Dull as a plough share rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show
For a dollar and a half

[Chorus]
Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

[Verse 2]
That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
""Gone to California""
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that westbound stage
You might also like[Chorus]
Come on little sister get up off my knee

In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house

One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee

Come on little sister get up off my knee

In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free

""Say that boy's a wonderment""
""No! The kid's a freak""
But that kid he don't care none
His black hands resting on the keys
Hopping like a big old frog
And hissing like a train
Entertaining royalty
All points east, west and in-between
General he's a fine old man
Treat him like his own
""Boy wouldn't know from money""
Just throw old Blind Tom a bone
From the times of King Cotton
May we present to you
All you Jim Crow monkeys
From Harlan County down to Tuscaloo
Play me anything you like
I'll play it back to you
Be careful what you call me though
Some things cut clear on through
I may be an idiot
I may be a savant
I didn't choose this life for me
But it's something that I want
Cocks that old big head aside
Grunts a word or two
Keeps them guessing every night
Is he really going to make it through
Faint hearts with their fans out
Starched collars and cigars
He weren't no use for slaving

Good sense shot down I placed you on a throne
Where was the wheel that kept me on the road
The force of nature preventing overload
So don't you know I've been dressed to kill
If you got the tools be careful what you build
When the arrow's in the bull's-eye every time
It's hard assuming that the archer's blind

Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand

There was never once

Threw some dead wood on the fire
Tuned the radio to silence
Watched the evening sun expire
Should have called you up this morning

I still search my shaving mirror
Looking for your face with mine

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by

And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight

But I can't stay alone tonight

Chalk up one more crazy notion
Imagination running wild
But if I needed confirmation
I would have gone that extra mile

I'm looking, I'm looking back
I'm trying to imagine this and that
The simple mathematics making up the map
Insurance of protection from immediate collapse
I'm watching, I'm watching you
A voyeur from a different point of view
The solitary eyes that I've been looking through
Committed to connecting the old ways to the new
And I see things
Through a curtain blowing back against the rain
Through the crack in a door that heaves with pain
And through every gap that gives away
Some secret in the dark
I'll come away with something
To keep you in my heart
I'm searching, I'm setting out
To prove without a shadow of a doubt
The age-old contradiction that's hovering about
A whisper in the darkness
Holds more truth than a shout
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor
A broken hearted lover simply looking for
Relief that's temporary from her dirty little war
And I see things
From the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms
From a satellite that's bouncing off the moon
And from every telescope
That's focused in on someplace dark
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart
Yes I see things
From the highest branch that looks directly in
Through a hawk's eyes gliding silent on the wind
And in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart

Forgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

[Verse 2]
Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

[Chorus]
I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

[Verse 3]
Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light
You might also like[Verse 4]
Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

I carried you in my arms
Through the hotel to our room
The night was filled with music
Those old historic tunes
Songs of revolution
Filled our hearts and fed our souls
As the fireworks exploded
Like those cannons long ago

See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See them shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight

The color's cracked and dry

Did they suffer when they died?

Give us hope and send us home

Lies rolled up on the floor

The warm forgiving smiles

Took a high dive arcing out wide
Into the crowd
Out to the sound of their wild applause
But you've heard it before
And you've seen it all
From up there on the diving board

[Verse 2]
You'd free fall into the ether
Above the people
Out on a limb fragile and adored
But who below knows that
You're still a mystery
Way up on the diving board

[Pre-Chorus]
Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

[Chorus]
But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board

Butterfly light
Escaping the reach
Of their fangs and their claws
Such a pale little thing
In your lily-white skin
High up on the diving board

Sink or swim
I can't recall

To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that
I'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground

On the ledge with one last chance to beg
To the deepest root of the oldest tree
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils
The treasure and the lesson to be learned
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

I'm waiting for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
All this time I spent being someone else's friend
Just one more time, for old time's sake I'd like to go back home again
The world had seven wonders once upon a time

It's sure enough the favored nations aided their decline
And all around me I've seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I'd say a men if I could get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again

Could have been a jailbreak and a spotlight hitting me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia, on the coast of Spain
Never tiring once of hearing songs about going home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home

He shakes his fists at busses and old posters on the walls
He knows someone who knew something about J.F.K
But his friends are just the shadows in the halls and alleyways
The rumbling frozen pipes whisper secrets in the night
In the coffee grounds, his fingers sketch a portrait of his wife
She knew the legal eagle when his wings swept through the stars
Before he shut the furnace down and sealed away his heart

[Chorus]
It's Gauguin gone Hollywood again
A sleeping giant inside a rabbit's skin
Tahitian doors beyond the painted veil
Another simple mind adrift
Like Gauguin going Hollywood again
The day lacks color, days are duller than a butter knife
Rusty water running through hands out of touch with life
A man of independent means, he'd have us all believe
A soul who throws his wings away before he goes to sleep

[Chorus]
If only for a moment, the dead weight were alive
An invitation for the flame to shine a light inside
Illuminating darkness, giving him release
Then someday in his trash can we'll find a masterpiece

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

[Pre-Chorus]
But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

It's a little bit funny
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
You might also like[Verse 4]
So excuse me forgettin'
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is the song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is

We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life

Your legend ever did

[Verse 3]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got

Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin'
You just fade away

[Chorus]
Don't you know I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

And blinkin', step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

Some say, ""Live and let live""
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin' high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away

It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby

In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice

What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden
Among the flagstones there
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect
Can damage so much grain

[Verse 2]
And what's it for?
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk
Nothin' grows no more
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed
We're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one
No one can replace

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'
""Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?""

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger
If only he could hear
Who lived there?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain
And with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'

The less I say, the more my work gets done

From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag

Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

[Chorus]
And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)

[Piano riff]

[Verse 2]
I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive

Spends his days countin'

When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand

There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

[Chorus 1]
That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh, where we meet
Ooh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye

There's a jukebox plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light

Ooh, where we meet
Ooh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

[Bridge]
There's a downtown smell of cooking
From the flame on an open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumping

Trying to look intelligent
In case the teacher looked at me

She's a middle-aged dream
And that lady means the whole world to me

It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration
For my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane

Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you

Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention
On some further education

Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek

Well, she's really going fine for eighty-four
Well, she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl, she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well, they got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah, but that ain't natural, yeah, well, so old Clay would say
You see, he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

We can share the troubles we already know

Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
I remember when rock was young
Gnomeo and Julie had so much fun
Gnomeo nights crying by the record machine
Had an old gold buggy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Eh! Everybody is feeling right
Because we're gonna dance all night
And the Crocodile Rocking was something of sight
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

But the years went by and the rock never died
Juliet went and left Gnomeo for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
Cause they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & Elton John]
Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say
Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face
A smile that spoke to me
In oh so many ways
The Sunday morning bells
Rang out that all was well
Sunshine across the yard
We'd rest when we worked hard
We take a little time off
To appreciate the day

[Chorus]
And love builds a garden
Grew it from the ground up
Each one of us knowing
Every inch of it was us
We pulled it all together
Hoping and believing
That love built this garden
For the two of us to dream in

[Verse 2]
We'd get a little rain
Then the sun came out again
But a frost it's hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die
There's only so much you can do
To keep some things alive

[Bridge]
Sad to say, it's true
Without a lover who
Cares as much
Well I guess, I guess it goes to prove

And love builds a garden
Grew it from the ground up

Every inch of it was us
We pulled it all together

Mi amigos, stop the clucking. You sound like a bunch of old hens. There's a lot of birds waiting to go on. For instance-
[PIERRE]
The boys in me back are called macaws

[JOSÉ]
Because of their claws?

[PIERRE]
No, because they're macaws
And my fine feathered friend is a jolly toucan
And two can sound better than one toucan can

[JOSÉ]
The bird of paradise is an elegant bird
It likes to be seen and it loves to be heard
Most little birdies will fly away
But the tiki room birds are here every day

[BIRDS]
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room

[JOSÉ]
All the birds sing words

[PIERRE]
And the flowers croon
[BIRDS]
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room

[MICHAEL]
Our show be delightful. We hope you'll agree
We hope that it fills you with pleasure and glee
Because if we don't make you feel like that
We're gonna wind up on a lady's hat

So strum the guitar and beat the drum
We've been a hit and we know you'll adore us
So come on and join us in another chorus

And it chills you to the bone

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
You might also like[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 3]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Post-Chorus]
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

[Verse 2]
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin'
You just fade away

[Chorus]
Don't you know I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

While you're in the world

Nostradamus said, ""I predict
That the world will end at half past six""
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio?
Was he listening to the government?
Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sales
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed

[Chorus]
We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox (tinderbox)
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox

[Verse 2]
Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far

The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We’ve fallen in and I can’t pull back
And I guess we’ll have to stay

In open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus
Twin spirits soaking up a dream
Fuel to feed the press machine
After years that were long and lean
We’re finally on our way

And Richard Nixon’s on his knees he’s sent so many overseas
He’d like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”

Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
With little room to swing a cat
And pretty soon we were “Where it’s at”
Or so the papers say

And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we’d never seen
Our heroes led us by the hand
Through Brian Wilson’s promised land
Where Disney’s God and he commands
Both mice and men to stay

In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen
I guess he’s just about the coolest guy I’ve ever seen
And for you and me that speeding car is how it’s going to be
I see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline

Oh, We heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”

It's just like Noah's ark
There's two of every kind
Pretty girls and boys in drag
Walking a fine thin line
Shaking hands and bussing cheeks
Licking their lips like they could eat
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Yea just like Noah's ark
Italiano promotion men
Chomping a big cigar
Slapping backs and making cracks
About the fags in the bar
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
You put it out son and we'll all back it
Yea it's just like Noah's ark

[Chorus]
And the waves are crashing round us
But we're ready for the flood
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
In the beak of a snow white dove
We're not as dumb as we might look
You can't keep us in the dark
With me and you it's two by two just like Noah's ark

Trying to hook it up for the late night shift
Here in Noah's ark

And we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage

I remember it like it was yesterday
Snow in the park and skaters on the ice
Long black cars standing side-by-side
Loading up the boys at night
Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
Not something you'd see on a New York street
It's such an uncommon sight

[Chorus]
But I wouldn't have it any other way
This city's got a thing about it, don't try to understand it
New York city I'd really like to stay
New York city I wouldn't have you
I wouldn't have you any other way

[Verse 2]
Oh the subway rumbled underneath
Italian lights where joey gallo died
And the man on the door down at 54's
Letting only the pretty inside
I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
Late in the day and longing for the night
Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
But somehow it feels so right

Nostradamus said, ""I predict
That the world will end at half past six""
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio?
Was he listening to the government?
Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sales
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed

[Chorus]
We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox (tinderbox)
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox

Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far

While a fancy car back on Savile Row
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are going to have to change

The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town
Oh the tvs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over hell suspended by a single thread

[Chorus]
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

[Verse 2]
With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer because I've cancelled out the time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all

He wasn't famous but I sure did love him
I've got his picture in a little frame
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name
But there's so many more and I've lost count
The hows and whys aren't important now
All that matters is they came around
And brightened up our lives
She was twenty one with her life ahead
You don't need to know her name
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade
But fate's right hand isn't always just
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust
She was just a little girl isn't that enough
To rage against the day

[Chorus]
And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey the colors run when the rain falls
But blues never fade away

And some I'm not so sure
Either way they all left their mark
And for some I found a cure

From one you learn something
Another you learn, nothing
And there's one who might teach you everything
But before I learned to listen
And if indeed someone said it
Then I guess i must have lost it on the wind

And one was just a trophy catch
And one was like a curse

A little conversation tonight
Thinking aloud how we struggled to find
Our place in the dizzy heights
Don't often do this
We never really get the chance
Nearly froze to death on oxford street
Now we're sitting in the south of France
Talking through the evening
It's good to shoot the breeze
Just you and me on a balcony
And cicadas singing in the trees

What a time of innocence, what a time we've lost
Raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you

Sentimental twilight
Conversing on those virgin days
Laughing about how the two of us sound
Like a Tennessee wWlliams play
Honest, it's amazing
That we can get together at all
For in between the saddle and the grand piano
We can read the writing on the wall
Talking through the evening
Sitting here side by side
Just you and me on a balcony

I've been out here on this road some
Can't help feeling I've been showin' my friends around
I've seen it growin' from next to nothin'
Into a giant, eatin' up your town
Called up the tea leaves and the tarots
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands, oh yeah
She saw a mountain and wild deer runnin'
A crazy kid becoming a better man

[Pre-Chorus]
But we stuck around for the fireworks
Waitin' to explode
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
And me on a yellow brick road
Pleasin' the people some of the time
For better or for worse
An urban soul in a fine, silk suit
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt

[Chorus]
And you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', ""Truth for sale""
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid
You might also like[Verse 2]
We've been missin', at times, in action
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you, oh yeah
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
But he never got to wear our shoes
Oh, we've conjured up what we created
Way back then, when I was standin' up in six-inch heels
Now you're ridin' off into the sunset
And I'm still spinnin' like a Catherine wheel

[Pre-Chorus]
But we stuck around for the battle
Waitin' for a plan
To turn you into the brown dirt cowboy
And me into a rocket man
It pleases the people some of the time
Diggin' into our roots
But I got a brand new pair of shoes
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots

[Chorus]
And you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', ""Truth for sale""
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale

No, you can't go back
And if you try, it fails

How can this be
This devil leaves
And god abandons me
I'm left here looking at these flames
That too could set me free

The vessel that I used to be
Is tainted now and ripped apart
Bathed in madness by that fiend
Who's robbed me of my human heart

To contemplate this crimson hell
Is more than I can stand
Did I send so to seal my fate
Offered up by hell's own hand

For here, I am a thing of darkness
Thrown from this ungodly swoon
Immortal from a savage kiss
Kept from my eventual doom

But wait, did I invite this fate
This invitation from the damned
This introduction to the dark
Was never in my mortal plan
You might also likeAnd if indeed this cruel joke
Was somehow in my destiny
Should I embrace its wicked ways
And haunt the night for what I need?
(For what I need)
(For what I need)

To die in such a way
And simply to be born again
A thing of terrifying strength
A bringer of bewitching pain

And blood becomes the drug I need
Will blood fulfill the thirst in me?
The thirst that sends them to their graves
The thirst for that which I now crave

This thirst
This thirst is strong
It overpowers all right and wrong

The thirst
I feel it coming on
The thirst
I feel it coming on
The thirst
I feel it coming on!Embed"

For so many years, we've shared this path together
Kindred spirits in search of history
For you, the holy grail is where we come from
But it's a different road I crave these days for me

You dwell so on the dawn of our creation
And search for ghosts from our mythology
But for now, the wonders that the world can offer
Mean more to me than ancient family trees

To hear the waves pound the timbers of a snow [?]
Fighting off the coastline of Cape Horn
To travel in the shadow of the long boats
To where the giants of the artic were born

Where the dangers in the deep dark Congo river
Where the crocodile hunts and the python strikes
To watch another predator in action
Could rejuvenate some meaning in your life

A thrill to hunt in such exotic places
I can almost taste those beauties in Siam
The brown skin boys of Mykonos and Rangoon
The shy Chinese behind their painted fans
You might also likeMy need to go is hard to fight
I want to gaze upon this world
Just like the northern lights
And of all the things about you that I'm going to miss
Is the bond we formed together through this crimson kiss

My son, so dear, the world's out there
Mystery calls and I can't resist
But you and I have memories
Bound together by the crimson kiss

[Lestat, spoken]
I did not give you the dark gift so you could turn and walk away from me

[Gabrielle, spoken]
I gave you the gift of life, knowing that some day you would walk away from me!

[Gabrielle]
With the well spring of my strength unrestricted
There's so little I could fail to endure
I could face a treck across the Himilayas
Survive the freezing mists of Scottich moors

My need to go is hard to fight
I want to gaze upon this world
Just like the northern lights
And of all the things about you that I'm going to miss
Is the bond we formed together through this crimson kiss

Mystery calls and I can't resist
But you and I have memories
Bound together by the crimson kiss

What more could one expect of something new?
A feast of saints and sinners
A home-spun web of bold beginnings
This new world boasts a most collective stew

And so indeed I'll plunge into the stream
Here, no regret no longer lingers
New passions here I'll cling to
In America, I'll reconstruct my dreams

The German and the Irish flock here with hope and family
And melody of language fills the streets
Like myself, therе are the French, who bring thеir old-world common sense
While the Spanish bring their fine nobility

Hear the tribal garb and manners of the free people of color
Seems strange to me when others are enslaved
This New Orleans, this melting pot
Is overflowing with cast-offs
Who've been dragged or freely came across the waves

And here there's cheer in the streets
As they shout out the windows
Welcome to the New World!

Where is the glory in this new me?
Where is the feeling of achievement
In the shadows of the evening?
Where is the satisfaction in your killing creed?

Who am I now, I don't know

And deal with your persistence
And somehow, some way, you set me free

And I don't think that I can take another night
Of these instincts that I fight
This overwhelming dread
Of feeling damned inside

Oh god help us, just look at you
Shrinking away from my point of view!
Showering me with your pious blamе
The gift that I gave is exеmpt from shame

Embrace it

This pleasure you deny

Well, in this superficial splendor
The decades will seem endless
And will the drudgery of torment be my bride?

Are you so blinded by contrition
That you see, in my position
A failure to practice what I preach?

I don't think that I can take another night
Of your craving for the light
This wilted flower act
That questions wrong from right

Look at you, you dissaprove!
Like two fussy mothers
Who are you to criticize the habits of another?
Did I rob the family gold by dining on the help?
Aren't I just the little beast
Well, I can't help myself!

When stars are born
Are they cast out
To wander cold and lonely, lost in space?

A loveless point of light
That can't return
Forever fixed within one place

When love is lost
And dreams are cast
Like bruised and battered pieces left to die

When hands that reach out
Are betrayed
How can my tortured soul survive?

There's only one thing left
And that's the one thing that you needed most of all
For the freedom that you gain
Is the loss that led you aimless to the shore

And I'm borne high on these waves
Swept by the wind and alone
Oh, sail me away
Carry me back to my home
You might also likeI'm tired, I've been torn
A cruel wretched storm churns like a gale in my bones
Oh, sail me away
Carry me back to my home

These scars run deep
The future holds a hunger for your innocence that passed away
Your callous shadows mock
And make it clear some things were not enough
To make you stay

The moment time stands still
Is the moment that the writing's on the walls
The words are clear as ringing bells
The pride is present right before the fall

And I'm borne high on these waves
Swept by the wind and alone
Oh, sail me away
Carry me back to my home

I'm tired, I've been torn
A cruel wretched storm churns like a gale in my bones
Oh, sail me away

Claudia was nothing to you, why, Armand?

[Armand, spoken]
For this moment...
For this beautiful moment

[Armand]
What taste is this upon my lips?
A taste so sweet, what can it be?
What is this scent upon the air
That fills my lungs and comforts me

And whispers low
How does it feel
To savor up such just revenge
TO smell the fragrant sea of loss
And drunkenly inhale his pain

Oh, can it be your countenance
Is stripped of all its dash and dare?
And what of your bold confidence-
Could it have drowned in your despair?

And after all this time
I wash my hands of your charade
And celebrate your fall from grace
Preserve that sad look on your face

For vengeancе, that at last is mine
Comes sweetly after all this time

[Lestat, spoken]
You never meant to help me, did you?

[Armand, spoken]
You, who destroyed all of it?
You, who took everything?!
What made you think I would help you?

[Armand]
If you'll allow me to recall
How my requests were swept aside
At every instance I beseeched you
I was shut out and denied

You shattered what I once conceived
From the moment you arrived
And now you wonder why I gloat here
Reveling in your grand demise

You're arrogant!  Beyond contempt
You beg to share my precious blood
I'd no sooner you in my veins
Then to see you with the ones you love!
And after all time
I wash my hands of your charade
And celebrate your fall from grace
Preserve that sad look on your face

And praise what god might manifest himself to beings such as us
For vengeance, that at last is mine
Comes sweetly after all this time

Was a happy, jolly soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when

And the rest of you in powder blue

But I'll make you this guarantee, see

No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

In the dark, on the phone

And your favorite colors

And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky

The whole country is watching to see how this great new organization, this new adventure, this new experiment, comes out. The great experiment of socialism in a democracy depends on you.

Grandma, do you really not remember about granddad?

[Spoken GRANDMA]
'Course I do!
How could I forget your granddad, Billy
We were married thirty-three year

[Spoken BILLY]
So what was like like
[Spoken GRANDMA]
He was a complete . . . Bastard!

[GRANDMA]
I hated the sod - for thirty-three year
We should never have married of that I'm quite clear
He spent the housekeeping money on whiskey and beer
And never lifted a finger
Times were hard, but the swine rolled back pissed
So we'd fight and he'd swing and he rarely missed
So I'd clobber the sod when he couldn't resist:
Asleep, you can't lift a finger

But we'd go dancing
And he'd hold me tight
He was air, He was water, He was breath, He was light
And he would hold me there, with all his might
And it was bliss for an hour or so
But then they called time to go
And in the morning we were sober
You might also likeO he'd drink and he'd talk just like a fool
Lie like a bairn and snore like a mule
Rarely was sober, pretty much was the rule
And he never lifted a finger
I suppose times were hard, things were different then
Women were women and men, they were men
Seventeen, that was it, your life ended when you had a ring around your finger

But we'd go dancing, he was me own Brando
And for a moment there my heart was a-glow
We had dust in our hair and nowhere to go
Boo we were free for an hour or three
From the people we had to be
But in the morning we were sober

But if I went through my time again
Oh I'd do it without the help of men
Or at least your Grandad
But then again, you know
Best not to linger

What is the use of dreaming now?
I had my chance, well anyhow
If I'd only known then what I know now
I'd've given them all the finger
And gone dancing, and not give a shit
And spin around and reel and love each bit
And I'd dance alone and enjoy it
And I'd be me for an entire life
Instead of somebody's wife
And I never would be sober
And I never would be soberEmbed"

To cheer up the place?
What is wrong with dressing up in satin and lace?
Get some earrings, some mascara, heels and a fan
Pretty soon you will start to feel a different man

What the hell's wrong with expressing yourself?
Being who you want to be?
Will anybody die if you put on a dress?
Who the hell cares if your blusher's a mess?

Start a new fashion, buck all the trends
Emphasise integrity

Cos what the hell is wrong with expressing yourself
For wanting to be me?

Fine, fine, fine

It's not a big statement, it's not a weird act
Just a good idea at the time
We'll not complain about your boring life
If you'll just leave me to mine
If you wanna be a dancer, dance
If you wanna be a miner, mine

Everyone is different
It's the natural state
It's the facts, it's plain to see
The world's grey enough without making it worse
What we need is individualityEmbed"

Can you hear it in the distance?
Can you... sense it far away?
Is it old Rudolph the Reindeer?
Is it Santa on his sleigh?
It's heading up to Easington
It's coming down the Tyne
Oh! It's bloody Maggie Thatcher
And Michael Heseltine!

[Chorus]
So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

[Verse 2]
They've come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for business parks and lower rates of pay, so...

Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath

We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

[Verse 3]
And they've brought their fascist bootboys
And they've brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress
Will be at the party too
And they'll all hold hands together
All standing in a line
Cos they're privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time, so...

[Chorus]
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath

Oh once I was a young man
Looked over vales and hills
Saw myself a future
Of riches and of thrills
But on me fifteenth birthday
I paid my union dues
And they sent me deep into the ground

Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die

Oh once I had a family
Sons to make you proud
They have gone and left me now
And I count the time out loud
For now, I am an old man
Just waiting for my turn
Till they take me back into the ground

Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die

Oh once I loved a woman
She meant all the world to me
Saw ourselves a future
As far as I could see
But I was only forty-seven
When they took her down from me
And buried her deep

Can I just ask you, Billy
What does it feel like when you're dancing?

[BILLY]
I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting, losing who you are
And at the same time something makes you whole

It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening and then I disappear
And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird
Like electricity, electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free

It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell
You might also likeIt's like that there's a music playing in your ear
But the music is impossible, impossible to hear

Like electricity, electricity

Here's a piece of advice, Billy
Piss off out of here
Start everything a-fresh and don't look back
There is sod-all left for you here
You are very fucking special
Now piss off before I start to cry

[MINERS]
Once we built visions on the ground we hewed
We dreamt of justice and of men renewed
All people equal, in all things
We once were heroes
Once were kings
But all great things must come to pass
We know the first will soon be last
And in the ground we may be lain
But a seed is sown to rise again

So we walk proudly
And we walk strong
All together
We will go as one
The ground is empty
And cold as hell
But we all go together when we go

Each soul redeemed, each life fulfilled

The battle's lost but not the war

And we walk strong

There's a porch swing in tupelo
In the shade of the south
Where the sweet honey drips off that old hush-your-mouth
It's a slow road on down
That old natchez trace
Through alabama cotton fields to a state of grace
It's a crisp golden autumn
On the tennessee line
Rolling down to mississippi like you headed back in time
Town's closed on Sunday
Everybody's in church
It's empty as the moon this place here on earth

[Chorus]
And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in tupelo
I got nothing to do except hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
Here on this porch swing in tupelo

[Verse 2]
His mama must have loved him
That truck driving boy
With the grease monkey look and the rock and roll voice
Well i was just thinking about him
Because I guess he sat here
Singing all praise to god through poverty's tears

Well, they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope inside
There's a chance you'll find
An answer in the sky
Well, they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold on to something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

[Chorus 1]
And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown

All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

Because our love's all worn out

Has dried up with the years

But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess

I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart

Haven't always been sober in counting my ducks
And if I look back now I've had my share of luck

I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction

Gonna spend my last dime on a telephone call
Because she's the wildest thing I've ever seen

Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood

Have you been to where they broke a dream?
Where there really isn't room for doubt?
Somehow we got lost
And the truth is buried somewhere in between

And know too many tears, too many tears

Why a balcony in Memphis, Tennessee
Seems trapped in time

Can you hear it in the distance?
Can you... sense it far away?
Is it old Rudolph the Reindeer?
Is it Santa on his sleigh?
It's heading up to Easington
It's coming down the Tyne
Oh! It's bloody Maggie Thatcher
And Michael Heseltine!

[Chorus]
So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

[Verse 2]
They've come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for business parks and lower rates of pay, so...

And they've brought their fascist bootboys
And they've brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress
Will be at the party too
And they'll all hold hands together
All standing in a line
Cos they're privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time, so...

I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting
Losing who you are
And at the same time, something makes you whole

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like that there's a music
Playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I disappear

[Chorus]
And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like that there's some music
Playing in your ear
But the music is impossible
Impossible to hear

[Chorus]
But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying

It's a little bit funny
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song

Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot, they say
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

[Pre-Chorus]
He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said ""God is dead
And the War's begun""
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

[Verse 2]
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past

It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Where the dogs of society howl

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you

And if you need to know while I'm still standin'
You just fade away

We can share the troubles we already know

Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Verse 2]
Do you ever dream of me?
And do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you

Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

[Chorus]
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction

No tears to damn you

I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

[Verse 2]
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away

It is where we are

That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinkin', step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
Some say, ""Eat or be eaten""
Some say, ""Live and let live""
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

[Chorus]
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin' high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple, really, isn't it? A word or two, and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well

[Verse 2: LeAnn Rimes]
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me, and I need not reply
Every moment of my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand

[Chorus: Elton John & LeAnn Rimes]
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day

[Verse 3: Elton John, LeAnn Rimes, & both]
Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned

You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me

[Chorus]
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

[Verse 2]
You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried up and sick to death of love
And if you need to know it
I never really understood that stuff
All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em, as they say, and weep
I never felt enough to cry

When I say that I don't care
It really means my engine's breakin' down
The chisel chips my heart again
The granite cracks beneath my skin
I crumble into pieces on the ground

We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment
On Orlando and 4th
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
Like a Chinese proverb
We were always searching
Nightlife's a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes

[Chorus]
And the tears never came
They just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growing
Like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the emperor's new clothes

[Verse 2]
We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly
We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperor's new clothes

Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you

[Chorus]
Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond

To make a champagne shower
Poach some horn and tusk
To build an ivory tower
Been to Philadelphia
The day it was closed
I walked to New Orleans
Down a Louisiana road

But not a skull among 'em said boo to me
In a time of wine and cheap cigars
I'm on top of the world

Look Ma ain't life grand

Ain't you proud of me

So much confusion, so much doubt
Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

Left to die on a high ridge fence

It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand

But it's your blood that stains their hands
Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence

In a cloud of incense
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place

Still I hunger for you when you look at me

Underneath my skin
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin

The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life

There's some things I don't have now
Some things I don't talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides
There's consequences I'm scared to taste
Cold hard truths I can't face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass
And everywhere I look there's something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
Don't answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
Don't fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
Can't explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark
And everything I hear never makes any sense

A cupful of pencils and a self help guru

You can take her
Make her change her name
You and your old money
Dance around the flame
But you can never, never love her like me
You can charm her
Calm her when she's wild
Show a little comfort
Play with her inner child
But you can never, never love her like me

[Chorus]
So I just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep
Sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week
You may have her in real world but if you could only see
How we rock this room in the twilight zone
And you can never, never love her like me

[Verse 2]
You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her
She's the love of your life
And no, you'll never, never love her like me
You can bless her
Keep her conscience clean
You can undress her
Go all the places I've been
But you'll never, never love her like me

It's a case I guess of paradise lost
Ten years back on the hands of the clock
In that little house on Mansfield
On your old block
Sometimes the magic of the past is all we've got
Just you and me at a crossroads then
Isn't it funny how we were old friends
Accidentally thrown together
Did we intend
To be the romantic novel you never want to end

[Chorus 1]
And it's the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room
And how I kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune
You said, 'Funny but it feels like I've known you all my life
And how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight

[Chorus 2]
In between the Star of David and the California moon
The Santa Ana winds blew warm into your room
We were crazy, wild and running
Blind to the change to come
In that little house on Mansfield
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone

In the candlelight I can recall
Your naked shadow looking ten feet tall
Like a wild pony dancing
Along the wall
Off balance I found love the only place to fall

You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me

[Chorus]
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

[Verse 2]
You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried up and sick to death of love
And if you need to know it
I never really understood that stuff
All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em, as they say, and weep
I never felt enough to cry

When I say that I don't care
It really means my engine's breakin' down
The chisel chips my heart again
The granite cracks beneath my skin
I crumble into pieces on the ground

You can't always count on the prayers in your sleep
But this cold light's still killing me
If I pay the ransom
Well can they guarantee
To split the chains, slip the knots
I don't know if they'll ever set you free

[Bridge]
I just can't rely on all these twisted signs
Too many bright lights turn you blind
The history of the blues
Seems to swim in your eyes
Pick yourself up, throw your head back
Take a long, long look into the sky

[Chorus]
Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you

I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

[Chorus]
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Verse 2]
Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

It's a little bit funny
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgettin'
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is the song

Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

[Chorus]
Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh)
Sad songs say so much

[Verse 2]
If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Was build by the divinities by Gods
Who saw fit to bestow
The gift of a paradise
Peaceful and harmonious upon
Us mere mortals below

And made El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
One thousand years ago

But all this was granted
For only one millennium
I know my legacy is to fulfill
My promise to all my people
Who have trusted me, the Gods
Will approve of us still

Preserve El Dorado

And I believe they will

Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

[Verse 1]
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

[Chorus]
Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

And watched it slip away
Where are we now?
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me

[Chorus]
Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon

[Bridge]
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us

With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Still we are, have always been, will ever be as one

What is done hath been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye

Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose
The same joy, the same sadness, each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say

Brave, intrepid and then some
Pioneers of maximum
Audacity whose resumes
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam
On the trail we blaze

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze

Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child

Breathe the Iberian atmosphere
Just because we are Hispanic
Doesn't mean we're oceanic
Quite frankly we've had water up to here

We've made waves to last a lifetime
We've been saturated, almost drowned
We are Spanish not Caribbean
We are human, not amphibian
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground

There's no future in the new world
Only fools believe the tales
Of the gold of El Dorado
Only suckers set their sails
We have seen the way the tide is turning
We see what no sailor can
We are in the ball, discerning
We're antediluvian
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man

There are women who are lining
Every avenue in every port
Now at last we'll get to grips with
Things they never equip ships with
We have sailed into our last resort

On the boat to El Dorado

We don't want to go aboard

I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
The town's already on its knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
I barely know the words to any hymn

[Verse 2: Randy Newman]
Listen, if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes I
Can see us being sacrificed or stuffed
Let's be gods, the perks are great
El Dorado on a plate
Local feeling should not be rebuffed

[Chorus: Elton John, Elton John & Randy Newman]
It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a terrifying notion
All those prayers and those salaams
Any normal man would bridle
If he's forced to be an idol
And a normal man's exactly what I am

All the same, it's pretty clear
The scoundrels don't keep much up here
They must have zillions under lock and key
But gods can force them to unleash
Enough to make us nouveau riche
Beyond our wildest dreams, so follow me!

[Verse 4: Randy Newman]
Can't you see I won't relax
If religious maniacs
Tell me I'm all-powerful and sublime
How can I be their belief
When I'm lying through my teeth?
Why don't we just say, ""some other time""?

[Chorus: Elton John, Elton John & Randy Newman]
It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings, keep them sweet is my advice
Be nirvana, be salvation
Be all things to all men
Butter up your congregation
Every Sunday score a ten
The alternative is dire
Simply frying pan to fire
So sign on two new gods for paradise, paradiseEmbed"

Paradise so wisely hid
Overshadows Barcelona
Aragon, Castile, Madrid
Where on Earth can match your riches
Match your people fine and free
Why return to old world values
This is how the Earth should be

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

El Dorado, queen of cities
Overflowing with excess
Every turn exotic, lavish
Precious wonders numberless
Lead me now into temptation
Surely you would not deny
One who's come so far to find you
All your blessings save goodbye

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, (she could be the death of me) El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

El Dorado, golden prison
Sheer perfection, sheer despair
How can one who knows such splendour
Feel the answer lies elsewhere
All I know is I must leave her
Or she'll be the death of me
Put my trust in poorer places
Let the queen of cities be

I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
(Tulio, what are you talking about?)
There again they're on their knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
Which rather suits us in the interim
(The interim, the interim, that's me and him
Oh my god!)

[Chorus]
It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a rather touching notion
All those prayers and those salaams
And who am I to bridle if I'm forced to be an idol?
If they say that I'm a god that's what I am!

[Verse 2: Tulio & Miguel]
What's more, if we don't comply with the locals' wishes
I can see us being sacrificed or stuffed
(You have a point, that's very good thinking)
So let's be gods, the perks are great!
(Yeah!)
El Dorado on a plate
(Thank you)
Local feeling should not be rebuffed
Never rebuffed
A-never rebuff a local feeling, no, my friend!
You might also like[Chorus]
It's tough to be a god
But if you get the peoples' nod
Count your blessings
(Yeah!)
Keep 'em sweet
That's our advice
(It's great advice!)
Be a symbol of perfection
Be a legend, be occult
Take their praise, take the collection
As the multitudes exalt
Don a supernatural habit
We'd be crazy not to grab it! (You got it!)
So sign up two new gods for paradise
Paradise!Embed"

Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields

Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night

I guess you're okay
You seem to feel better these days
I've known you for so long
I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey
You know that's true
You can shake your head but I can prove
I've seen things through your eyes
You think you win but in the end you lose

[Chorus]
And there's no second guess
We take no second bets
Chances are we're a long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love
With words that can't express
The truth implies you're high and dry
And you're a long way from happiness

[Bridge]
I'm one step behind
Looking out for you all the time
I'll put my faith in you
And steer you clear of love that leaves you blind

I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

[Pre-Chorus]
And his promise made was never clear
It just carved itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my head
On the night he said to me

[Chorus]
Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses

[Verse 2]
We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
On the flat, dry desert, I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now, I shall be free

Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses someday

And when we start we say forever
We say we care, we need, we feel
You read the movement of our eyes
But in our hearts we still believe
The end will come, before we know
The silent rule of love applies
We light the fuse and let it burn out
We just accept that love must die

[Chorus]
And so they say ""The end will come for us""
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
No I won't believe the end will come for us

[Verse 2]
The end will come like sudden rain
The end is never what it seems
We sink the ship before we sail
We just accept what failure means

[Chorus]
And so they say ""The end will come for us""
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must

But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us

There's a great awakening and a new morning
And your spirit's pounding loud and clear

Streets are empty just like me
The murmur of an echo
Seems to come from every window
Is loneliness the same as being free?

I guess I must have been dreaming
To think that I believed in you at all
Now I just can't fight it
As the shadow of the night begins to fall

Oh, I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore
Let the cold night air cool the heat
Of two hearts gone to war
For no matter who wins in the end
Love's got a lot to answer for

The best of all protection
Freedom's like the stars in the sky

Must have been the right month
Must have been a good time
Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
Every single glass of wine
Must have learned some home truths
Sitting in that cool grass
Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
Every shooting star that passed

[Pre-Chorus]
Should have had a talk with God
Sitting in the great unknown
Watching all the lovers in the world get together
Sitting in Heaven all alone

[Chorus]
And we were love's knot after summer
Tied together in the dead of winter
Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
Bound together in the autumn
Every month means a little something
But January is the month that cares

Must have kissed you until I hurt you
Must have been a wild night
Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
Rag dolls in the mornin' light
Must have found a secret place
Hiding in our own world
Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
Every single sound we heard

Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it
After all these rough seas, left me reckless and abandoned
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning
Break down the cold front, give me peace and understanding

[Pre-Chorus]
And you wait, and you wonder
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder?
Will she still be the star and see me through?
Because I can't steer my heart clear of you

[Chorus]
No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view, and should I drift away
The compass holds the clue, you control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you

[Verse 2]
Make me your penance, show me your innocence
Everything is history, from the aching to the pleasure
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us
Everything gets twisted, let me burn or bring me water

It's written clear, across the room
In silent words the blind could understand
I came here to relax and find
A sleep that soaks me up
Like surf and sand
And you appear as I descend
A soft outline all poised and a feather light
I come into the darkness now
To conjure up a dream
And close my eyes

[Chorus]
And don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream

[Verse 2]
Don't send me back to real life
The daily grind just leaves me feeling numb
Leave me in my wicked dream
Where pressure cracks and beauty
Comes undone
You might also like[Chorus]
And don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream

[Chorus]
So don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked
Come and join me in my wicked
Come and join me in my wicked dreamEmbed"

I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

[Pre-Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti]
La promessa non fu chiara
S'erra solo impressa in me
Vidi solo il gelo dentro me
Quella notte dise a me

[Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti]
Vivrem comme cavalli
Liberi dai recinti di ferro
Che piu non voglio
Rinnegare i sensi
Su dai fuggiam
Vivrem comme cavalli

[Verse 2: Elton John]
We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate

Nel deserto la nave abbandonai
Per me aveva senso
Son stato troppo tempo nella bestia
Ed ora saro libero

[Chorus: Elton John]
Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses someday

[Outro: Luciano Pavarotti]
Liberi dai ricenti di ferro
Che piu non voglio
Rinnegare i sensi
Su dai fuggiam
Vivrem comme cavalliEmbed"
