Special (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin' to somebody in a video
Talkin' about somethin' I posted in a video
If it wasn't me, then would you even get offended or
Is it just because I'm black and heavy? Y'all don't hear me though
I've been the same since I've been drivin' slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new, but I've been used to people judgin' me
That's why I move the way I move and why I'm so in love with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know

[Chorus]
In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect

[Verse 2]
Could you imagine a world where everybody's the same
And you could cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change?
How could you throw fuckin' stones if you ain't been through her pain?
That's why we feel so alone, that's why we feel so much shame, hm

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know (Oh)

[Chorus]
In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (Perfect)

(Ooh) I know that I'm not alone, oh, so

Uh, yeah, yeah (No, oh, woo)

In case nobody made you believe (Oh-oh)

Woke up this mornin' to somebody in a video
Talkin' about somethin' I posted in a video
If it wasn't me, then would you even get offended or
Is it just because I'm black and heavy? Y'all don't hear me though
I've been the same since I've been drivin' slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new, but I've been used to people judgin' me
That's why I move the way I move and why I'm so in love with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know

[Chorus]
In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same

I just wanna lay it down and open up the deepness

[Pre-Chorus]
All the conversations say I should feel a way
I don't care what people think or spin or sway
We can run away (Yeah)
Let down my guard
Undo my robe
I'm standin' here
Don't need no clothes

[Chorus]
I'm naked
Love how you look at me naked
Come make this body feel sacred
I'm a big girl, can you take it?
Naked

[Verse 2]
Beauty is a gift, but curses everyone that chase it
I wish we could live without no body expectations
I've seen every part of me and, babe, I can't erase it
If I get on top of you, you promise to embrace it?

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I've learned to love me as myself
But when I'm with somebody else
I question everything I know
How can you say I'm beautiful?

[Refrain]
When the world can't love me to my face
When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid

[Chorus]
'Cause if you love me, you love all of me (Ooh)
Or none of me at all

[Verse 2]
I accept the things that I can't change about you (Ooh)
But can't accept the fact that I can't change myself too, uh (Ooh)
Wish I could fall in love with me so easily like you did (Ooh)
Bein' good to me like I am someone else seems so backhanded

When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid (Oh, yes)
When the world can't look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
When the darkness takes over my mind (Takes over my mind)
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't you be afraid, no, no, no, no, no
When the rain falls and I'm locked outside (Woo)
Will you be there, standin' by my side? (Standin' by my side)
Hold me close, don't let me run away

Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do
And everything you do

[Verse 1: Lizzo]
In Tulum, we pretended we're married
And that little tiny house was our home
It was so freein' to know that we made it
To know that I never ever will be alone

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzo]
All we had was time
And at the front of my mind
I was so close to leavin' the world behind with you, ooh-ooh

[Chorus: Lizzo & Chris Martin]
And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you
(And everything you do)

[Verse 2: Lizzo]
Goin' to sleep, holdin' hands at the sunrise
Wakin' up, holdin' hands in the rain
I feel so goofy, I don't really do this
But with you is healin' how I feel pain

[Verse 3: Lizzo]
My defense mechanism kicks in
Makes me run, run away from the real
It's easy to cut you down while I close me up
Instead of tellin' you how I feel
And we waited so long, but the sex is so good
Five years in the makin', didn't know if we would
Do you say this shit to other people?
I don't think that I could (I don't think that I could, no)

Special (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin' to somebody in a video
Talkin' about somethin' I posted in a video
If it wasn't me, then would you even get offended or
Is it just because I'm black and heavy? Y'all don't hear me though
I've been the same since I've been drivin' slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new, but I've been used to people judgin' me
That's why I move the way I move and why I'm so in love with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know

[Chorus]
In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect

And you could cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change?
How could you throw fuckin' stones if you ain't been through her pain?
That's why we feel so alone, that's why we feel so much shame, hm

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I've learned to love me as myself
But when I'm with somebody else
I question everything I know
How can you say I'm beautiful?

[Refrain]
When the world can't love me to my face
When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid

[Chorus]
'Cause if you love me, you love all of me (Ooh)
Or none of me at all

[Verse 2]
I accept the things that I can't change about you (Ooh)
But can't accept the fact that I can't change myself too, uh (Ooh)
Wish I could fall in love with me so easily like you did (Ooh)
Bein' good to me like I am someone else seems so backhanded

When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid (Oh, yes)
When the world can't look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
When the darkness takes over my mind (Takes over my mind)
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't you be afraid, no, no, no, no, no
When the rain falls and I'm locked outside (Woo)
Will you be there, standin' by my side? (Standin' by my side)
Hold me close, don't let me run away

In Tulum, we pretended we're married
And that little tiny house was our home
It was so freein' to know that we made it
To know that I never ever will be alone

And at the front of my mind
I was so close to leavin' the world behind with you, ooh-ooh

My defense mechanism kicks in
Makes me run, run away from the real
It's easy to cut you down while I close me up
Instead of tellin' you how I feel
And we waited so long, but the sex is so good
Five years in the makin', didn't know if we would
Do you say this shit to other people?

Special (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin' to somebody in a video
Talkin' about somethin' I posted in a video
If it wasn't me, then would you even get offended or
Is it just because I'm black and heavy? Y'all don't hear me though
I've been the same since I've been drivin' slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new, but I've been used to people judgin' me
That's why I move the way I move and why I'm so in love with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know

[Chorus]
In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect

Could you imagine a world where everybody's the same
And you could cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change?
How could you throw fuckin' stones if you ain't been through her pain?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know (Oh)

In case nobody told you today

Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do

In Tulum, we pretended we're married
And that little tiny house was our home
It was so freein' to know that we made it
To know that I never ever will be alone

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzo]
All we had was time
And at the front of my mind
I was so close to leavin' the world behind with you, ooh-ooh

Makes me run, run away from the real

Instead of tellin' you how I feel

Hi, motherfucker, did you miss me?

So when I shake it, I can shake it fast
Make that camera flash, camera flash, camera flash

Woke up this mornin' to somebody in a video
Talkin' about somethin' I posted in a video
If it wasn't me, then would you even get offended or
Is it just because I'm black and heavy? Y'all don't hear me though
I've been the same since I've been drivin' slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new, but I've been used to people judgin' me
That's why I move the way I move and why I'm so in love with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today

In case nobody made you believe

Welcome to my body, I know it's nice to meet it

Can I be discreet with you? Will you keep all my secrets?
I just wanna lay it down and open up the deepness

I don't care what people think or spin or sway
We can run away (Yeah)
Let down my guard
Undo my robe

Love how you look at me naked
Come make this body feel sacred

Beauty is a gift, but curses everyone that chase it
I wish we could live without no body expectations

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I've learned to love me as myself
But when I'm with somebody else
I question everything I know
How can you say I'm beautiful?

[Refrain]
When the world can't love me to my face
When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid

[Chorus]
'Cause if you love me, you love all of me (Ooh)
Or none of me at all

[Verse 2]
I accept the things that I can't change about you (Ooh)
But can't accept the fact that I can't change myself too, uh (Ooh)
Wish I could fall in love with me so easily like you did (Ooh)
Bein' good to me like I am someone else seems so backhanded

When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid (Oh, yes)
When the world can't look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
When the darkness takes over my mind (Takes over my mind)
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't you be afraid, no, no, no, no, no
When the rain falls and I'm locked outside (Woo)
Will you be there, standin' by my side? (Standin' by my side)

Look at the stars, look how they shine for you

In Tulum, we pretended we're married
And that little tiny house was our home
It was so freein' to know that we made it
To know that I never ever will be alone

All we had was time
And at the front of my mind
I was so close to leavin' the world behind with you, ooh-ooh

My defense mechanism kicks in
Makes me run, run away from the real

Instead of tellin' you how I feel

So here we are
You're finally able to listen to this album I've been workin' on for three years
And I know it's been a long time and it's about damn time I put it out
But you have to know that I took my time for me
But I also took my time for you
I wrote almost a hundred and seventy songs for this album
To find these perfect twelve songs to bring to you because
I felt like this was what not only I needed to hear
But you needed to hear and the whole world needs to hear
These are songs about love
Whether it's sеlf-love, love for your family, love for your friеnds
Or love for a significant other
I really believe that love for ones self and for others is what this world needs to be a better place
If you can take just the time to give a little love to yourself every single day
Treat yourself with respect
Treat yourself the way you deserve to be treated
And then treat somebody else with that same love and respect?
That expands, that grows
And that can save a life
It saved my life so many times
And I'm so honored to be a part of your life
I hope you enjoy the music
I hope you cry, laugh, dance, twerk
Do the splits, do whatever you wanna do
I'm honored to be doing it with you
So thank you for listening to Special, loving Special, and being special
'Cause if you don't take nothin' away from this album, I want you to know
You're special and I'm so glad you're still with us
Thank youEmbed"

Woke up feelin' like I just might run for President
Even if there ain't no precedent, switchin' up the messaging
I'm about to add a little estrogen
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself
Only exes that I care about are in my fucking chromosomes
I don't really need you, I'm Macaulay Culkin, home alone
Bad bitch, diamonds in my collarbone (Yee, yee)
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar, spice, and I'm nice
Show me what you're made of
Crazy, sexy, cool, baby
With or without makeup
Got nothing to prove (Got nothing to prove)
But I'ma show you how I do

Find me up in Magic City bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it (Like a girl)
Go and throw it (Like a girl)
Hangin' out the 750, feelin' bossy in my city
'Cause I run it (Like a girl)
Run it, run it (Like a girl)

Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type

[Pre-Chorus 1]

They used to say to keep a man, you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
No, I'm never lonely (Lonely)
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like ""Damn, she the one""

Poor little baby
Who told you that you stood a chance with this royalty?
You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either
I'm sorry, 2 AM photos with smileys and hearts
Ain't the way to my juicy parts
Boy, thank me later, looks good on paper
But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part

Your style and that beard, ooh, don't get me distracted

Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

[Verse 1: Lizzo]
Woo, child, tired of the bullshit
Go on, dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzo]
If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

Woke up feelin' like I just might run for President
Even if there ain't no precedent, switchin' up the messaging
I'm about to add a little estrogen
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself
Only exes that I care about are in my fucking chromosomes
I don't really need you, I'm Macaulay Culkin, home alone
Bad bitch, diamonds in my collarbone (Yee, yee)
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself

Sugar, spice, and I'm nice
Show me what you're made of
Crazy, sexy, cool, baby
With or without makeup
Got nothing to prove (Got nothing to prove)
But I'ma show you how I do

Find me up in Magic City bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it (Like a girl)
Go and throw it (Like a girl)
Hangin' out the 750, feelin' bossy in my city
'Cause I run it (Like a girl)
Run it, run it (Like a girl)
I work my femininity
I make these boys get on their knees
Now watch me do it, watch me do it
Look it, look it, I'ma do it

True story
No glory, let's go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They used to say to get a man, you had to know how to look
They used to say to keep a man, you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
No, I'm never lonely (Lonely)
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like ""Damn, she the one""

[Post-Chorus]
One, one, one, one, one, one (The one)

You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either

Ain't the way to my juicy parts

But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part

True story
No glory, let's go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They used to say to get a man, you had to know how to look
They used to say to keep a man, you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
No, I'm never lonely (Lonely)
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like ""Damn, she the one""

[Post-Chorus]
One, one, one, one, one, one (The one)

Who told you that you stood a chance with this royalty?
You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either

Ain't the way to my juicy parts
Boy, thank me later, looks good on paper
But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part

Why're men great 'til they gotta be great?
Huh?
Woo!

[Verse 1: Lizzo]
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
I just took a DNA test
And it told me I'm the realest pretty chocolate nigga
Out here with some good dick, no cap
And I can have a bitch from Harvard with a eight-year degree
I prolly still'd rather pull up with a hood bitch (Let's go), uh
Now she wanna trip on me (For what?)
I was doin' my thing, she was backin' it up
She was puttin' them hips on me
You know when your friend with the red hair was in town
You was puttin' them lips on me (Mwah)
And I just keep gettin' lips from 'em
But I know what to do, I put dick on ya
Your friends like to talk 'bout the stuff that I do (Uh-huh)
But your friends wanna fuck on me too (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And the way that you treat me, I wanna get even
I'm thinkin' like what should I do? (Hmm)
But I know how you move outta spite
She bigger, I prolly might lose in a fight
And I'ma talk my shit, but I'm in love with her big fine ass
So I'ma do what she like
She told me

New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Lizzo]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see 'em
It's okay, he already in my DMs

Uh, uh, uh, I'm in the, I'm in the, I'm in the
I'm in the business of making music, that music business
The fitness, no one can witness cause I
I make that crack music (nigga!), uh
That real Black music (nigga!)
The only singles that I'm dropping are the ones
Flapping at the band of your white briefs
White boys please! Can barely believe
I walk by as they hold they skeets by the seams of they jeans
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, and run it to the hills y'all
Straight into my pocket, tired of the deals dog
Start my own label, keep the leaking sealed off
If you got a big mouth, then you might get peeled off
I'm the only fat-lipped bass, my flipper--vroom!--peel off
Eating flounder, Sebastian's like some bath salts
Munching on his bones, looking at him like ""It's yo' fault!""
""Look at what you made me do! Yo, pass the hot sauce""

[Verse 2]
Looking at the back of Sophia Eris's head
Eating a sammich (but we don't got bread!)
Got a spider ass bite on my head, hangry
Feeling soupy, I brought my fuck in, yo I'm duckin'
Donald, Daffy, Howards, them cowards
Could never throw shots at a super with power
What was Russia without the czars?
What was Henry Ford without the cars?
My grandparents worked at Ford factory
So Henry is nothing without my family tree
And his slave-owning family needed Black blood still
So I think we need a spot up on Henry's will
That would never be the case, in case you ain't keeping up
I'm dishing out cases of that heavy bass
And them bassheads straight from the oppressor's loins
Are giving us our ""Free us!"" in hella coin

LA carolin' with Carolyn
Caroline but I had to make it rhyme, I'm
Addicted to that weather like heroin
That is why I cannot give it any time, just say no!
It's too good to me, you are too good to me
O.D. on compliments, I need some oxygen
So I dip to the PNW, some of ya don't need where that is - good!
Need a little solitude with my crew
'Membering what's real is what makes you you, oh!
It's too good to me, know it's no good for me
I can't be out here homie, what it used to be
Sitting in bed like ""man!"", wishing
Itching for days with no end
Sound checks, checks in, audiences rapping
Getting full of that adrenaline, eat it up like Satan
You can't have it? Take it, you can't man up? K then
Breaking up my cadence, got that willpower like Jaden, blaow!

My hands are cold
My lips are tired, tryin' to blow (blow!)
To give them warmth
It's not enough, one heart alone
Cannot suffice
It simply can't, I've done the math
But in due time
There is no chance, for love

I try to try (see the love through)
I try, to try

Your skin is warm
It keeps me up though I am tired
I’m tryin' to know
What else? Why else has this happened?
One man alone
Cannot suffice, I’ve done the research
Ignore the role
Inside my bed, your lion features (no!)
You can't lay on my shoulder
There are spikes and scales
And your cheek would just depress me

Love the taste of it, (you clench your jaw)

Have you ever been to Paris at night?
Say something French
On va voir Lionel Richie au Zénith ensemble ça va être cool

[Verse 1]
Right out the gate, I'm flowin' individually
You owe me your check
Respecting a pony, I swear to God like a helmet
Free as I move booze
I'm paid to amuse you's
Amazed at how soon we could get this far
Broke off of mix tapes
Still broke off that mix tape
But I promise y'all that it won't last as long
'Cause me and my girls, delinquents
We renting jewels and the trinkets
Trumps bumping something fan fare when we arrive like

[Chorus]
Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
You might also like[Verse 2]
I feel like any minute decision
With precision, I pick off
Make my selection on who I choose to crew with
Girl, don't touch us
I know you want us to slip but
Slippin' is something we don't do
Tippin' for life, grippin' that ice
You thirsty to wife, uh
We playing y'all home like bassoons
We going straight up like balloons
We fresh outta that saloon
We steady making y'all goals droop
With that vidal, with that sasoon
You been lost, where you been at?

[Chorus]
Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
(Oh my gosh)
(Don't bother me
Don't bother me)
[Bridge]
I beg you, don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
He drops it on the floor
My side dude complains and keeps it on the low
He touch himself to magazines
To pictures of his own

D-d-don't bother me, bother me
D-d-don't bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me

[Outro]
Ego
Been showing lovers their own selves
Covered in [?]
Pride
Without natural affection
Truth ablaze
Where you been at?
Where you been at?
Bother me, bother me, bother me
I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
It got me thinkin' about thinking of you
I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
And you know I, know I, know I loved you
Think 'bout you
But I don't got time for livin' side the comforts
Of my God damn time so I leave it up to me
You been sendin' all these broken signals
I just keep him asking what we could have done
You tell me that I am too ambitious
But I break the moulds and you just watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
You watch my stone roll away from you
It didn't even take three days
Didn't even take me there
Didn't even take me thereEmbed"

Here we are
And all my big girls tell ‘em
Here we are
Bigger than the sun and the moon

[Hook]
We can take over the Earth

[Verse 1]
Too bad you couldn't be on the roster
Ya man, ya dig, ya can't speak rasta
Betty SpaghettiOs, no pasta
Just hog the coin like Whore-hey Washington
Poster child for big black ambition
Coattail-flunking and Timmy's wishlist
Tim chance be the only thing on my wishlist
Fried chicken and a bottle of Seagram's (Right?)
Stereotypical archetypes
Arching and bishing, get radio play, like
Im'ma fit right in today
Let me get a seat at the front of the Grammy's
Let me get a little bit of bitter grapes
I can't want what I want anyway
So I just kick back like Kid ‘n’ Play
Staying on the come-up like, 'that's my play'
Cinderella , 2am, ain’t got nothin’ on the way I keep the movin’
Shoot the hits and out the lat to rap the lap
Rappers all about the double enten-dres
Andre the Giant, on Dre the three stacks
Poppin chick peas like some andre manila
Manila your rice up and (red?)

And all my big girls tell it
Let the big girls tell it

Come on, come on, welcome to Earth
We like to kill each other, turn each other to dirt
Got a lotta money? You the man now, babe
Better break me off some, Imma show you crazy
Show y’all crazy anyway
Any way you wanna slice that key lime tasty
Got my batches and cookies, gettin’ nasty on sookie
Me and Sophia did it all for the nookie
Fame, love and money
It’s powerful thangs if you think it is
But the thang is, it’s thankless to
Be the baddest chick who ain’t naked
That’s cool, what’s cool, I ain’t postin’ flick
You a magician you like turnin’ tricks
Got a trick for you, or maybe a treat
Now get your freak on a leash and lick my feet

[Verse 3]
I am on another level
Elevator, escalator, brahman
Pocahontas in her corset shading the Queen of England I am
Fools be like “The precipice is the end”
But I think it’s the beginnin’ (what)
Close your eyes and take the leap
Watch ‘em wave as you fly to the top no drop (fly)
[Interlude]
Her- here- here- here we are
Yo can take- take- watch us take over

[Chorus]
It’s bigger than the sun and the moon
I can feel it in my bones, we can take over the world
And all my big girls tell it
Let the big girls tell it
Bigger than the sun and the moon

Mama-se, mama-sa, I'mma dream
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
Hol' up, hol' up, wait, no, hol' up
Gotta pack with my girls, no feelings all green
But you know no ""i"" in the team
By golly, Miss Molly, we in this thang
Big Bag Wolf, he make them piggies scream
All three houses--straw, sticks, bricks
And we blew 'em all down, dang, blousers
I don't play games but I know enough about 'em, how to win 'em bruh
Realize that it's not a game and jealousy is unhealthy competition yo
Welcome to the field, nigga, home of the field nigga
Hard-working mother, ugly duckling, black swan
Try to keep it in the real some time
But I gotta deal with a whole lotta nothing
And my whole life in front it so I guess I gotta run it
Seeing futures when I close my eyes
But I gotta deal with a whole lotta nothing
And my whole life in front it so I guess I gotta run it

I stopped talking to my mama for three months
No eye contact during lunch
Wasn't nothing else around us but mountains and trees
And my guilty worthless screams, ""What was wrong with me?""
Was the question, it was, it was ""How could she?""
What happen to a daddy girl when daddy don't exist no more?
I guess we gon' see

[Hook 1]
Wishing I could call you
You know when that bell ring
Angels get they wings
Someone tell me we gon'
Be alright but I think
That I gotta be
One deep
One deep, one deep

[Bridge]
Dip my black body in gold (uniform)
I just wanna shed (ice cold)
Diamond crust (getting warm)

[Verse 2]
Somebody put me on the soap box
I got the voice of my kin folk, my mama
Mama gave me blessings and then some
I'm youngest of two, feeling like a elder
Alone in my room, wishing I could tell ya
""I love you"", ""I love too""
The best of me only comes out when it's you
But sorry ain't in my vocabulary

Ooh, what's deeper than, what's deeper than the darkest best
Kept secret? Beneath the surface, we could
Let it bring us together, or it could tear us apart, oh
I'm filled with it, I gotta love with no conditions
Though it's hard to re-envision time and time again
Even when, even when it didn't matter anymore
The most beautiful thing that you ever seen
Is even bigger than what we think it means
Reflections in my bloodstreams, it's even bigger than

They 'bout burn him up, the drones have him surrounded

Click, click, hashtag, pound sign it
It's on your trending map, co-sign it
But when they come, please do not run
Just open your mouth unto Zion
Big bear, little human
A lot of salt, a little cumin
Add it to the pot, and light it up
Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow

Whomp whomp whomp
Remote please, mute!
You can have your pennies and your two cent 'tude
(oh my God that's so messed up, how dare she say that in a song
Anti-fem, she's so wrong. I'm gonna post this on my blog)
Take a hike! Matter'o fact--jog
I've been running what took so long
I've been gunning for the top (boy stop!)
I've been reviving this thing, Ben Taub
If you took it upon yourself to take your self so literal
You're missing on the minerals to liberate your inner liberal
Generally I don't give a rat's patootie
But you pursued me
So here's my battle cry against those who slew me, who never knew me
(Big girl, small world)

Smashing these tracks...and that's what I'm into

Ain't that something? With your oompady-doo like
""Ding dong, the witch ain't dead, you better look out 'fore she chop yo' head!""
Breaking bread with the queens at the dinner table
Lapdogs eat scraps if you're able
Maybe throw you a bone if I feel like it
Maybe give you some steak if the mood right
Right now, homie, bow down
Looking at my head like my head need a crown
Crown on the rocks, nigga, weed in the box, nigga
Give me if you got figures, what I want's a lot bigger!

Say my name three times like I'm in destiny

Chillin' with my niggas in the back like mane
Came a long way, umbrellas for the rain
If you came this far, you better play the game
Because success and fame be two different things
I remember being sad about boys and stuff
But that was way back in middle school
Now I'm making crowds make noise and stuff
And all my people back home like, ""who knew?""
Normally I don't like to toot my own horn
Cause I don't got a car yet and, well, that sucks
Being a rapper these days ain't what it seems
Man, really you ain't making all the big bucks, but I'm killin' it
I'm just saying that I'm feeling the wheeling one would experience
While wheeling and gripping the wheel and gettin' it
And my limericks be the same thing that get me on the cover, trick!

Kiss me on my ego, tell me what one tastes like
I've never been the proud one, kicked it hard in stage right
Ego's can take a pounding, when the mind's dim and the light's bright
Too bad for you, that your ignorance is in hindsight
In retrospect, remembering the time I was derelict
More like Derelicte, I made homeless chic
Kick it in the Subaru
Played a show, showered at the gym, and slept at the studio
My Lean Cuisine was a ramen noodle but you know I rocked that

These fickle, fickle niggas holdin' out for a pretty penny
You swallowin' the truth and now you wizzin' like it's Henny
I'm ""run, Forest, run""-ing and my instincts be Jenny
Jenny Craigin' on them boys, I cut the fat and keep the skinny
Here's a skinny on them motherfuckers that get caught up
Yeah, you tryna be the man and ya pushin' ya luck
And you frontin' like we homies then you call me like I owe thee
What about the shit you owe me like the time I spent with yo' ass for free?
You really think I'd waste my time with you?
Building a business relationship if the shit gon' sink?
Nigga, that's how you really feel? Nigga, that's how you think?
Think again next time ya come steppin' to me
Cause I wasn't put on this earth to sing back up for you
Especially if you gon' be selfish and not come through
And I told yo' ho ass partner ""Go fuck off"" too
So we know why I don't fuck around with you
And I hope it burns in yo' stomach cause Lizzo on the rise
And I won't respond to yo' e-mails like ""Duh"", surprise
And I don't hold grudges but, boy, ya cut off
And, I mean, you got a little bit of talent but that's not enough
Awwww maannn

Put a sting in her lips, [?] for the eye
Go on, take a sip, got milk in her thighs

Unless it's just some DMT that's all up in my energy
Yup yup, go on place that bet
If you wanna come test in the mama's nest
With a bullet vest and curious chest
Got the ammo on the brain but I hide the best
Hey, I'm pumped up call me dough cooking
Gooey salty soul tookin', batches in a row lookin'
Magic as all hell, we livin', never ever will we give in
To a wack beat fuck with Lazerbeak in these mad streets
Get it, go there and we give it, haters will forbid it
They fall into the minutes because of imagination
Now the ones who in the nation, we the ones who need escapin'
Then we find some new ovens and we made it

Cut a niggah up and hung him like Jack the Ripper
Undo your zipper, get on your knees
And get ready for the industry in a nutshell (get it?)
Them goods don't get got if it's the only thing you got
Better keep them in that hot black pot
The only thing colder than the local talent, are the winters
Thrift store shopping, look like Anna Wintour
You ain't gotta ask about it cause I been hurr
Ridin' in them chariots like we in Ben Hur
Yah sure, ya know, yah sure, ya know, yah sure, ya know...
Rappin' and rappin' and I been steadily stackin'

South west alief Texas not born but raised
I was kicking it in the west
But mostly down in the trae
Or maybe montrose for a picnic
Galleria boy I was getting it
Playing shows spreading my name
But it was so hot the summer's insane
At South by South West
I was put to the Johnny test
They wanted a freestyle battle
Ok, pants vs dress
One little line
And them boys was impressed
Ditched the southwest to Minneapolis

I pull up to the Minne and get buck wild
Moving it shaking it by the pound
West bank, wild n out
Trying to see what that’s all about
First ave was recently
My niggas sold it out for a week
I step on the stage
The scene was serene
They ask my name
Said it was Queen
You might also likeI don’t what that means
But I know that its good
Nefertiti flow gives you Anuksun wood
Estrogen's in this testosterone heir

So I’m going to sit in my throne
And you can get in your chair

I’m from that south west alief texas
Boy we reckless
Diamonds in our teeth
Shining brighter than your necklace
Aw snap, I got it like that
Writing raps to the boom bap
Setting off a click track
Lyrical, spherical, psych
Just mobbin
And if you got that guap
You better watch it cause we rob you

Ben Taub you, life support
Straight As in life check my progress report
Address my court with piercing eyes
Your knees are shaking can’t hold your thighs
I’m barely phased, hardly surprised
I’ve been the queen, you’re just another guy
Marty McFly, boy you better think
I’m throwing everything at you like the kitchen sink
Yep, so you can sit in your chair x3
I going to sit in my throne and you can sit in your chair x3

Feeling like the world’s going to drop
If I don’t do nothing, I’m going to pop
Now I’m hotter than a boiling pot
If you super tight, people flip
If you fall off, you’re a flop
Never thought nothing, would be better than something
That’s why I stay watering my crops


I’m not thirsty baby, I’m just lonely
And I’m not distant baby, I’m just busy
Will you miss me baby, when I’m touring
Or will you find someone that’s less important
But worth exploring, I’m torn in pieces

So much to do, hold on got to write in these features
I’m listening, but not really
You know us artist types
When we got to go, you got to let us


Go (gotta let us)- repeat


It’s cold outside
And I was thinking
And I was thinking
How warm it is
In the cloud (posturepedic)
But all that is, is vapor, condensation, conversation
Not really, but Jack Daniel's is the life of the party
Get it started, let him do the talking
Let that man speak
This girl is going to break your heart
Run far away this is your head start
Everything is not what it seems
The girl of your dreams is a nightmare
You don’t care
You might also likeMan, that Jack Daniel's be lying on me
Cause of that dude now you laying on me

Keeping it together, got the brave in the membrane


Ticky, tick tick that keeps you sane
Are the remnants reminiscing in my brain
1947 when he caught that train
And met my momma’s momma in the pouring rain
Ok, light skinned brother with the hazel eyes
Cause ain’t nobody messing with VJ
I got a sense of humor, I theorize
From everything he sent down my way
Bloodlines, like cousins like loving
It’s nothing. Put them down when its tough
And tie those loose ends to make them meet
Everything is gravy when your people live down the street

I see ya, so wait…
Take this before you escape
Don’t make the past feel like a mistake (repeat)

Swirling, black abyss
Stardust misting, raining down
Shining like the gems of eternity
Formulating for me and mine
Perhaps one day we can mine
Throwing all those minerals and chemical elements
Into the pot
Uh-oh we’re getting hot
Through some sun on the stove top
Close the lid, beware of the pop
Of the splash back
Add a dash of that acid
Voila

Time go by pretty fast, you wear a pretty mask
You take it off for no one, oh, being you? That’s no fun
You’re being used for show, hun, if that’s what you think so what?
You got a lot of friends, owe you a lot of favors
They bake you porky pies, they come in lots of flavors
Don’t listen to the haters, you think that you have haters
Haters are just complainers, and you the first to complain

Oh, it's you? Uh-huh, that's funny
That's real cool, it's me too
I tell 'em, preach!

These niggas is nuts like cashews
And they wanna be blessed like ""ahhchoo""
But me not have time like Cogsworth
All in all for what it's worth
And the fact that I wrote this in a skirt
(Looks like you don't even need to try)
I’m burying y’all alive
Goes to show I’m leading in the hive

Werk like a Boss

[Verse 1]
Talk talk talk talk talk talk talk
That's what everybody and they mama wanna do
Whomp whomp whomp
Remote please, mute!
You can have your pennies and your two cent 'tude
(oh my God that's so messed up, how dare she say that in a song
Anti-fem, she's so wrong. I'm gonna post this on my blog)
Take a hike! Matter'o fact--jog
I've been running what took so long
I've been gunning for the top (boy stop!)
I've been reviving this thing, Ben Taub
If you took it upon yourself to take your self so literal
You're missing on the minerals to liberate your inner liberal
Generally I don't give a rat's patootie
But you pursued me
So here's my battle cry against those who slew me, who never knew me
(Big girl, small world)

[Hook]

Do I need to re-remind you that you sipping from the C-h-a-l-i-c-e
And I'm doing all this for the W-E?

Getting dirt for the turf like a workaholic
But your worth cop a shirt 'cuz you work is na-na
Niggahs can't pay rent putting hustle in their mou-mou
Grasp for the raps for the stack when they can. Do
Slack, and I have to attack and offend you
Smashing these tracks...and that's what I'm into

[Verse 2]
Lookin like a girl cause I'm keeping it youthful
Such a freakin lady, classy and beautiful
Thinking like a man, for those who don't understand
Is having two grips to gain the upper hand
If you had the courage to give me reprimand to my face
Instead of slight of hand, you da Man!
(My employees no-i-me)

A-what you mean? Been up in this thing so long, I'm like a sleeve
Covering, I'm outchea, please don't be deceived
Roll me up? Nigga please! Don't be presumptuous
I packed you up for lunch and I ate you, you were scrumptious
Literal or not, I'm rambunctious, you yellow belly munchkins
Ain't that something? With your oompady-doo like
""Ding dong, the witch ain't dead, you better look out 'fore she chop yo' head!""
Breaking bread with the queens at the dinner table
Lapdogs eat scraps if you're able
Maybe throw you a bone if I feel like it
Maybe give you some steak if the mood right
Right now, homie, bow down
Looking at my head like my head need a crown
Crown on the rocks, nigga, weed in the box, nigga
Give me if you got figures, what I want's a lot bigger!

[Chorus]
What you mean
What you mean
What you mean
To me, to me, to me, to me

[Verse 2]
Lizzo be eating though, Lizzo be hungry
Lizzo Big GRRRL Small World till it ain't funny
Say my name three times like I'm in destiny
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Four Loko
Chillin' with my niggas in the back like mane
Came a long way, umbrellas for the rain
If you came this far, you better play the game
Because success and fame be two different things
I remember being sad about boys and stuff
But that was way back in middle school
Now I'm making crowds make noise and stuff
And all my people back home like, ""who knew?""
Normally I don't like to toot my own horn
Cause I don't got a car yet and, well, that sucks
Being a rapper these days ain't what it seems
Man, really you ain't making all the big bucks, but I'm killin' it
I'm just saying that I'm feeling the wheeling one would experience
While wheeling and gripping the wheel and gettin' it
And my limericks be the same thing that get me on the cover, trick!

Tar baby

Tar baby
Got it in the bag

[Verse 1]
Kiss me on my ego, tell me what one tastes like
I've never been the proud one, kicked it hard in stage right
Ego's can take a pounding, when the mind's dim and the light's bright
Too bad for you, that your ignorance is in hindsight
In retrospect, remembering the time I was derelict
More like Derelicte, I made homeless chic
Kick it in the Subaru
Played a show, showered at the gym, and slept at the studio
My Lean Cuisine was a ramen noodle but you know I rocked that

[Chorus]
Black mask, black sash (trick)
Pull up, silence, gasp!
Big girl, small world (thick)

Squeeze trigger, stay scheming then I realize I'm still dreaming
Oops, psych! Believing in believers ability to still scream for a nigga till you get nosebleeds
I be so scuffed up from kicking them rocks
And if you're so tough come run up and get clocked
Tick tock tock tock
If you got them slippery socks
Yo I'mma give it all that I got
To make a nigga slide in the vault
Then bake a nigga dash in some salt
I bring a nigga home and pole vault
Then blame a nigga like it's your fault
Your bad!
(It's your fault!)

I never understood and I will never understand
The tolerance for ho-ishness that some of you people have
""ME?"" You, yeah you
I'm talking to the middle man
Like how you're content with giving someone else the upper hand
Walking around your cubicle, your tie with your coffee mug
Siphoning the hard earned work from the thugs and hustlers, cuz
Takin a chill pill before I whip my sword out like Uma in Kill Bill
Makin niggas gasp like Emmett Till
And I'mma keep on giving you the gospel like God's will, Peace! Be Still

Can I fall in love before the world ends?
Can my record get a few major spins? I'm saying
I don't wanna think about tomorrow because I'm still hustling
Until then, I guess it's just me, you, theses food stamps and cravings
No raisins in the sun, just Funyuns and a Sunkist, we up in the club making it mist
Like a missed alcohol (though I see it every night)
And that Tylenol I take everyday period like Midol
Bye y'all, I'm moving on to other things by y'all
But not quite bilateral, more like three floors up and down the hall
Let the bygones be bygones, and try to keep the peace like Obama and Biden

All my friends are talented, all my friends got mad skills
All my girlfriends wear heels, all my niggas drug deal
We're tight (psych!)Embed"

It's that L to the I to the Z Z O
Ain't got no time for the C3P0, wookie
Never knock nookie, but I'd rather stack cookies
Looking at the sunset the color of Snookie
Woman of the year, huzzah huzzah huzzah, give her three cheers
Killin' everyone up in the coven, witch
Cuttin' all these niggas, better sew up, stitch
Will Smithin' these hoes, you know how it works
Punch a nigga out and say ""Welcome to Earth""
I drop a mil, take off a scarf
Locs on my face like ""I make this look good"", ugh!
Capitalize your capital with a capital G
Giving out my secrets, man, ya'll better pay me
Sucky people marry suckers and they suck
Then they have sucky kids, they grow up, then what?
They attend all the sucky universities
And take our money like it grows on trees
Siphon to the authorities then get confused when we
Conglomerate to the inner cities
Perched on streets, being super sketchy
Skid marks on their knees, their hands in their pockets
They walking by real fast in case we got that rocket
BOOM! Slam the door to they apartment
That sucky wife is pregnant with another sucka ass kid
I'm askin' ""When will it end?"", waiting on that meteor shower
To rain down and bring all these suck niggas to they final hour

I hear the sounds of gums bumping, they ain't saying nothing
I'm sick and tired of being typecast like Lindsay Lohan
When I'm gonna probably outlast most of these niggas flowing
A cover girl with the mouth of a tommy gun
Blow trees and I will blow you away when I'm on the stage
I guess that's why I got them shivering they're very afraid
I guess that's why my checks thin cause dem hate
They steady instigatin' on what they hate on
I'm the rainbow bridge like a pack of 50 crayons
Cause I ain't got no beef with no body
But those bodies need to realize that this is no hobby
I ain't your hook girl, boo, I'm your feature
And I don't need your attention because of my features
I swear to God I feel like a piece of meat every time I'm walking home or even a block from lake street
Man, give me room the only rapper with a womb that will spit that 16 bars to send you rappers to the tomb
Me and my crew we ain't playin' around
Cause ever since we landed we just been the talk of the town
While I talk I remember those who paid the price
I lost my pops man I wish he was alive
I can't let go of the past, he never heard me rap
So I carry his spirit on my back in Minneap
Lizzo in this thing so great, to complement my shape
Nicknamed hot dish complements of the state
I see you hungry niggas
Here you go, some steak
I guess you are what you eat
I guess you're Lizzo taint
Apologies to my mother she thinks that I'm a saint
Apologies to the rappers I dusted out the gate
Yo, I see you munching on my plate
Rip to any beat I meet, see ya

Are ammo of the knowledge that you don't know
But know now
Sick and tired of these hypocrites
I generations to back me up
Mama Kirkwood and Daddy Jefferson had to deal with it so I'm done
They raped and murdered my ancestors
Hung my great uncle from a tree
So when I look at that maple branch I look in the mirror and say ""could be me""
All of these niggas don't know where I'm from
All of these hoes they just wanna have fun
Acting like junkies
Looking like bums
Lower than scum
What's lower scum
What's lower than dumb?
The ignorance displayed by his insolence
He sprayed all the businesses
And laid someone's significant other and mother and brother in the streets
Who said that was OK?
Who said that was cool?

Something's got a hold on me
Drowning I can’t barely drink oh
Smoking I can barely breathe
Chopping up the royalty (oh)

They said that it’s a cold world
I tell them its my own world
And I’m about to pick the whole thing up
X2


You scare me
Cause there’s something darker hiding in disguise
Reminds me
That I’m exposed to be eaten alive

These cycles are liable
To go in circles, round about
What’s this about
Same drug different mouth
Same in different out
(This is my handle, this is my spout)
Now that’s I’m all steamed up
Just tip me over and pour me out

Pain leaves the body and the spirit wits
Substitute some whiskey for the Tylenol
Gotta keep this deal on going
If you feelin how I feel

So quit telling me you feel me
Cause can’t nobody feel
And quit telling us we’re famous
Cause we ain’t go no deal
And even if we did man
Then the industry ain’t real
Like I’m drinking and I’m driving
But my hand ain’t on the wheel
And I’m pressing on the gas
Cause I guess nobody will

South west alief Texas not born but raised
I was kicking it in the west
But mostly down in the trae
Or maybe montrose for a picnic
Galleria boy I was getting it
Playing shows spreading my name
But it was so hot the summer's insane
At South by South West
I was put to the Johnny test
They wanted a freestyle battle
Ok, pants vs dress
One little line
And them boys was impressed
Ditched the southwest to Minneapolis

I pull up to the Minne and get buck wild
Moving it shaking it by the pound
West bank, wild n out
Trying to see what that’s all about
First ave was recently
My niggas sold it out for a week
I step on the stage
The scene was serene
They ask my name
Said it was Queen
You might also likeI don’t what that means
But I know that its good
Nefertiti flow gives you Anuksun wood
Estrogen's in this testosterone heir

So I’m going to sit in my throne
And you can get in your chair
[repeat]


I’m from that south west alief texas
Boy we reckless
Diamonds in our teeth
Shining brighter than your necklace
Aw snap, I got it like that
Writing raps to the boom bap
Setting off a click track
Lyrical, spherical, psych
Just mobbin
And if you got that guap
You better watch it cause we rob you

Ben Taub you, life support
Straight As in life check my progress report
Address my court with piercing eyes
Your knees are shaking can’t hold your thighs
I’m barely phased, hardly surprised
I’ve been the queen, you’re just another guy
Marty McFly, boy you better think
I’m throwing everything at you like the kitchen sink
Yep, so you can sit in your chair x3
I going to sit in my throne and you can sit in your chair x3

I’m throning [till end]Embed"

Feeling like the world’s going to drop
If I don’t do nothing, I’m going to pop
Now I’m hotter than a boiling pot
If you super tight, people flip
If you fall off, you’re a flop
Never thought nothing, would be better than something
That’s why I stay watering my crops


I’m not thirsty baby, I’m just lonely
And I’m not distant baby, I’m just busy
Will you miss me baby, when I’m touring
Or will you find someone that’s less important
But worth exploring, I’m torn in pieces

So much to do, hold on got to write in these features
I’m listening, but not really
You know us artist types
When we got to go, you got to let us


Go (gotta let us)- repeat


It’s cold outside
And I was thinking
And I was thinking
How warm it is
In the cloud (posturepedic)
But all that is, is vapor, condensation, conversation
Not really, but Jack Daniel's is the life of the party
Get it started, let him do the talking
Let that man speak
This girl is going to break your heart
Run far away this is your head start
Everything is not what it seems
The girl of your dreams is a nightmare
You don’t care
You might also likeMan, that Jack Daniel's be lying on me
Cause of that dude now you laying on me
Flame is rekindled now I’m trying homie
Don’t leave me dry when I’m high homie
You don’t how it feels to appear the weakling of your peers from a fear
That’s inconceivable to have yourself and to suddenly to let it


Go (gotta let us)

My great great great great great grandmother
Was a maid
I think that were just made of the same thing
Keeping it together, got the brave in the membrane


Ticky, tick tick that keeps you sane
Are the remnants reminiscing in my brain
1947 when he caught that train
And met my momma’s momma in the pouring rain
Ok, light skinned brother with the hazel eyes
Cause ain’t nobody messing with VJ
I got a sense of humor, I theorize
From everything he sent down my way
Bloodlines, like cousins like loving
It’s nothing. Put them down when its tough
And tie those loose ends to make them meet
Everything is gravy when your people live down the street

I see ya, so wait…
Take this before you escape
Don’t make the past feel like a mistake (repeat)

Swirling, black abyss
Stardust misting, raining down
Shining like the gems of eternity
Formulating for me and mine
Perhaps one day we can mine
Throwing all those minerals and chemical elements
Into the pot
Uh-oh we’re getting hot
Through some sun on the stove top
Close the lid, beware of the pop
Of the splash back
Add a dash of that acid
Voila
One day we’ll show our kids what we did the Big bang

Dearly beloved, we’re gathered here today
Witnessing something that we cannot explain
Dearly departed, we’re gather here today

What you lookin' at? What you lookin' at?
Time go by pretty fast, you wear a pretty mask
You take it off for no one, oh, being you? That’s no fun
You’re being used for show, hun, if that’s what you think so what?
You got a lot of friends, owe you a lot of favors
They bake you porky pies, they come in lots of flavors
Don’t listen to the haters, you think that you have haters
Haters are just complainers, and you the first to complain

[Interlude]
Oh, it's you? Uh-huh, that's funny
That's real cool, it's me too
I tell 'em, preach!

[Verse 2]
Look up, don’t let nobody pass you
These niggas is nuts like cashews
And they wanna be blessed like ""ahhchoo""
But me not have time like Cogsworth
All in all for what it's worth
And the fact that I wrote this in a skirt
(Looks like you don't even need to try)
I’m burying y’all alive
Goes to show I’m leading in the hive
Queen bee, I want that honey
And you over here talking about money?
Hmmm, that’s funny
You need to keep in mind
My only price is time
And you can't take that from me

Sudafed, pop that, a hooligan, step back
I’m giving niggas headaches
Like a mistake on your wedding cake
Minuscule to me, I’m a big deal to you
I picketh thee off like a bug betwixth my shoe
Thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal
Spot lights or record deals, bus passes and happy meals
Nigga, what you know about it? Not much really
You holding out on dough or something? Not me silly
Niggas wanna help and niggas wanna take
Take a bit of this and put it on your plate
I owe you if you the right one
Luckily, I found the right one
Pass it down, I’ll make it right son
Give me time, I promise it’ll be worth it
