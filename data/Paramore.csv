War, a war, a war on the far side
On the other side of the planet
And I've got war, a war, a war right behind my eyes
Right behind them just like a headache

Turn off the news

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news
Every second, our collective heart brеaks
All together, evеry single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & The Linda Lindas]
Far, I'm far, so far from the front line
Quite the opposite, I'm safe inside
But I worry and I give money and I feel useless behind this computer
And that's just barely scratched the surface of my mind

Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening if you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it (Ooh)
Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it (Ooh)
Love is not a weakening if you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

[Verse 1: Hayley Williams, Romy]
What was the moment? It's hard to say
I'm sure I don't remember anyway
Before I only knew to hesitate
Pin back in the grenade
Does a light show up on my face?
Does it feel right in the wrong way?
What if I loved you and never said it?
Hide the emotion under the bed

[Pre-Chorus: Romy]
Would all the energy I waste
Be better shared with you?

[Chorus: Hayley Williams & Romy, Hayley Williams]
And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

I got too good at fighting chemicals
And dodgin' arrows I was asking for
Wading through the fog and then it disappeared
Naked when I'm here
I'm getting good at giving alibis
Imagination runs wild
No fear and self-doubt
Heart beating in my mouth

[Refrain: Romy]
Now every time I catch my line
I want to set it free

[Bridge: Hayley Williams & Romy, Romy]
Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening if you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it
Oh, love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Oh, love is not a weakening if you feel it rushing in

And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you

I can't wait to memorize this day
Oh, a picture could not contain the way it feels
You say, ""Live in the present""
I'm already dreaming of how it begins
And trying to savor the moment
But I know the feeling will come to an end

[Chorus]
So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again
Crave, crave
To do it again (Ah)
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missin' it
So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again

[Verse 2]
I romanticize even the worst of times
When all it took to make me cry was being alive
Look up and see a reflection
Of someone who never gavе way to the pain
What if I told 'em that now that I'm older
Thеre isn't a moment that I'd wanna change?

If I fall on my knees, I hеar you laughing
If I call out your name, you don't come

Said I'd walk the dog a little further than the driveway tonight
The extra mile
Thought I'd send a card with my condolences, but, damn, I
Just ran out of time

What if I'm just a selfish prick? No regard, ah

Never mind, I hit the snooze on my alarm twenty times
But I was just so tired
There was traffic, spilled my coffee, crashed my car, otherwise

But I know the feelin' will come to an end

[Chorus]
So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again
Crave, crave
To do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missin' it
So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again

[Verse 2]
I romanticize even the worst of times
When all it took to make me cry was bein' alive
Look up and see a reflection
Of someone who never gave way to the pain
What if I told 'em that now that I'm older
There isn't a moment that I'd wanna change?

[Bridge]
Any second, feel the present
Future and the past connectin'
Any second, feel the present

[Chorus]
Crave, crave
To do it again (To do it), all again

I am a magnet for broken pieces
I am attracted to broken people
I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleedin'
And it looks like my fault
And it looks like I'm caught red-handed

Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again?
Come on, give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

Only I know where all the bodies are buriеd
Thought by now, I'd find 'em just a little less scary

You hurt me bad this time, no coming back
And I cried 'til I couldn't cry, another heart attack
If I lay on the floor, maybe I'll wake up
And I don't pick up when you call 'cause your voice is a gun
Every word is a bullet hole, shot a hole in the sun
If I never look up, maybe I'll never notice

[Chorus]
And you, you want forgiveness
But I, I just can't do it yet

[Verse 2]
There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
And you can't break what you don't see, an invisible line
If I follow it down, will we just be alright?
But it could take me all your life to learn to love
How I thought I could love someone, I haven't even begun
If it's all up to us, we might as well give up

[Chorus]
And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)

And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go

Strange how we found ourselves
Exactly where we left off
I know you're shaking my hand like it is the first time
Are we alright?
Are you recounting all my faults?
And are you racking your brain just to find them all?
Could it be that I've changed?
Or did you? (Woo)

[Chorus]
Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

[Verse 2]
Time is a bastard
I won't break my neck to get around it
But aren't we so brave to give up a fight
And let the years go by without us?
'Cause now I feel you by my side
And I don't even care if it's been a while
I can feel that we've changed
And we're better this way (Woo)

One, two

[Verse 1]
I can't think of getting old
It only makes me want to die
And I can't think of who I was
'Cause it just makes me want to cry, cry, cry (Cry)

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't look back
Can't look too far ahead
I got the point
I got the message

[Chorus]
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going, but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

All the while just going blind
Can't see the forest for the trees
Behind the lids of my own eyes

Standing here like I'm supposed to say something
Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey
And I don't want your money, if I was you, I'd run from me or
Rip me open, you'll see you're not the only one who's hopeless
Be sure to put your faith in something more
I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel
We all got problems, don't we? We all need heroes, don't we?
But rest assured there's not a single person here who's worthy

I got your hopes up, now I got you hoping
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's such a long and awful lonely fall
Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
What if I fall on my face? What if I make a mistake?
If it's okay, a little grace would be appreciated
Remember how we used to like ourselves?
What little light that's left, we need to keep it sacred

Found these old letters from years ago
Felt it was fitting to continue that correspondence
Can't help I'm sentimental
Thanks for talking with me today
I hope this is helpful for you
I also hope that Birdie is happy and healthy
And staying out of trouble to a reasonable extent
What I wrote was sort of my way of finally being able to address how it feels to have…
[Verse: Aaron Weiss]
Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray
Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our RIOT! dance
Beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
Throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me
And when this repetition ends, behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambition win
Again, I'd hate to let you down, so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naïve expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me
So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You might also like[Chorus: Aaron Weiss]
You're no friend of mine, you're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

[Spoken Outro: Aaron Weiss]
…To see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realizing that what they see may not even be close to the image I see in myself
And I think I might actually be more afraid to let my own self down than anything else
I feel like the man in the story who saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago, I stood on the shore and jumped in and grabbed the coat
The river was rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood on the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat, but the coat won't let go of me
In any case, please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful9Embed"

I'm getting sick of the beginnings
And always coming to your defenses

And they're stronger than any addiction

And I miss who we were
In the town that we could call our own
Going back to get away
After everything has changed

When we were so alive? (Everything has changed)
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that? (Everything has changed)
Could you help me push aside
All that I have left behind? (Everything is changed)
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

And no one knows us at all

And going back won't feel the same

Been through the ringer a couple times

And my two friends know this very well
Because they went through it too
The three of us were initiates
We had to learn how to deal
And when we spotted a second chance
We had to learn how to steal

All we want is you to give us a break

No, we're not looking for violence, oh, oh

Much as we try to pretend
No one's as innocent as could be

But now we aren't looking backward

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me now
Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me now

[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm waking from the dead
And everyone's been waiting on me
Least now I'll never have to wonder
What it's like to sleep a year away
But weren't we indestructible?
I thought that we could brave it all
I never thought that what would take me out
Was hiding down below

[Pre-Chorus]
Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
Starting over or head back in
There's a time and a place to die, but this ain't it

[Chorus]
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now

Wish I could find a crystal ball
For the days I feel completely worthless
You know I'd use it all for good
I would not take it for granted
Instead, I have some memories
For the days I don't feel anything
At the least, they will remind me not to make
The same mistakes again

[Pre-Chorus]
Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
Starting over or head back in
There's a time and a place to die, but this ain't it

I told 'em all where to stick it
I left town with a dime to my name
Said I'm done with all of my fake friends
Self-righteous pawns in a losing game
Got my band and a light that won't go out
Been burning since the day I was born
So I'll cry just a little, then I'll dry my eyes
'Cause I'm not a little girl no more

Stood in line for so long just to picket
Something I won't ever understand
Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
Won't you just admit you don't care?
And, lady, I don't want your pity
So don't feel sad for me
I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe we're both just living out our dream

Why do you care what people think?
Are you hooked up to their leash?
You know anklebiters
Ate up your personality
Try to remember how it felt
To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters
Chew up, spit out someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
Fall in love with yourself
Because

[Chorus]
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got

[Verse 2]
What do you actually expect?
A broken mirror to reflect?
You know anklebiters
Gave you a false perception
And why do I (Come on, come on)
Defend your ignorance?
Oh, why do I (Come on, come on)
Defend the state you're in?

You should fall in love with yourself
Oh, again
Fall in love with yourself

Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead?

Why are you telling me goodbye?
Aren't you gonna stay the night? (Well... alright)

I pour my heart out to your voice mail

Lined with palm trees and only new faces
If I could look past the present and get there
Well, baby, it's worth a shot
Just enough time to plan an escape route
I put my map on the wall in the basement
Not quite a victory to run from your problems
But it's the only plan that I got
It's the only plan that I got

[Chorus]
And if you try to find me now (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out, so
I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on, that's what's going on

[Verse 2]
Crossed the state line and called out a warning
Not too long now, I'll breathe California
Paid my dues and I tried to be loyal
But now I'm done with all that
Where I'm going is everyone's story

It's not a question of who are we really
It's who we wanna be

How can they say
That it’s one way
When it’s the opposite?
And how can they know
The end of the story
Before I tell it?
‘Cause when I walk
Your feet, they fall
To the same beat
Or maybe we’re from two different worlds
But we've got our own language

[Pre-Chorus]
We talk to people
But they never understand
They think we’re crazy
‘Cause it sounds like noise

[Chorus]
When we’re speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue

Like we were strangers
We didn’t know any better

In with the out crowd
So we gave in
And we shut our mouths

And I can take it
And when you talk in code to me
I can translate it

But they never understand
They think we’re crazy
‘Cause it sounds like noise to them
Ain't it strange

Man, I even laughed a little today, oh, so strange, so strange

Hi!

[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

You are the only exception
Oh, you are the only exception
But you are the only exception

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams & Justin York, Hayley Williams]
Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
And I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh, glory
He-yeah-ha
Hеy

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
What a mess, what a mystery we'vе made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive even when it wasn't a mistake
I question every human who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Oh, glory
You will find me

[Chorus: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & Justin York]
Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
And I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh, glory

[Outro: Hayley Williams]
Hey!
I'll be lost until
Like the moon we borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night
So if you let me I will catch fire
To let your glory and mercy shine

[Spoken: Hayley Williams]
Thank you
Have you had a good time with us tonight?Embed"

Okay
Sounds good
This next song is from our self-titled record, it's called ""Proof""

[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
It's really hard
I can't cry in your arms 'cause you're not here
It's not your fault and if it was I wouldn't care
My heart is bigger than the distance in between us
I know it 'cause I feel it beating (Ha!)
So strong it'll knock you down (Go!)
So strong, so strong (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
Over here
I can't count the miles away from where I wanna be
I bet your skin is warm and that you're smiling
Yeah, that's what I always loved the most about you
You're so strong
Come and knock me down, hey

[Chorus: Hayley Williams, Justin York, Hayley Williams & Justin York]
Baby, if I'm half the man that I say I am (Whoa)
I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Whoa)
I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

I'll get in my car
Drive it faster than I ever did before
Head out west until I finally reach the shore
And then I'll swim out to wherever you are
And we'll ride the undercurrent down to the floor
Making friends with all the unfamiliar creatures
Pushing back on the unnecessary pressure
Come up for air just so you know we won't drown
You're so strong
The world can't keep us down, hey

[Chorus: Hayley Williams, Justin York, Hayley Williams & Justin York]
Baby, if I'm half the man that I say I am (Whoa)
I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Whoa)
I'll believe in what you say

We had to learn how to deal
And when we spotted a second chance
We had to learn how to steal

All we want is you to give us a break

Much as we try to pretend

What a shame, what a shame we all remain
Such fragile broken things
A beauty half betrayed
Butterflies with punctured wings
Still there are darkened places
Deep in my heart
Where once was blazing light, now
There's a tiny spark

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, glory
Come and find me
Oh, glory
Come and find me

[Chorus]
Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here, oh, glory

[Verse 2]
What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive
Even when it wasn't a mistake
I question every human
Who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed
Patterns in my mind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, glory
You will find me

So if you'll let me, I will catch fire
So let your glory and mercy shine22Embed"

To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around

Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing is changed

And the salt in my wounds

It's not that I don't feel the pain

Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together

But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house

So what if I don't have a lot to talk about?
I shut my mouth and keep it locked until it counts
And what if I don't ever want to leave my house?
Stay on the couch while all my friends are going out

[Pre-Chorus]
Alone

[Chorus]
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

[Verse 2]
I'll make the journey down the hall back to my room
And kill more time, and let it rot inside its tomb (Inside its tomb)
See, I ain't one to climb some social ladder too
Some Shangri-La that all the cool kids will abuse

Alright, here we go

I'm writing it out, loud
We don't talk about the past
We don't talk about the past now
So, I'm writing the future
I'm leaving a key here
Something won't always be missing
You won't always feel emptier

But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen

And the spark never lit up a fire
Though I tried and tried and tried
The wind came from your lungs
A hurricane from your tongue

Right behind my teeth
Your anger, your anchor
But I'll sail much further on

I'm overjoyed, I'm undecided and I don't know who I am
Well, maybe I'm not perfect, at least I'm working on it
22 is like the worst idea that I've ever had
It's too much pain, it's too much freedom, what should I do with this?
It's not the way you plan it, it's how you make it happen
Yeah, it's how you make it happen

And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have

And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up as long as its spins around
Hello cold world
Whoa-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Girls and boys keep lining up to see if they can measure up
They look good and they feel wild but it will never be enough
You say you're really hurting, at least you're feeling something
We can hope and we can pray that everything will work out fine
But you can't just stay down on your knees, the revolution is outside

When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

And I can't do this alone

And still they take a hold of me

With sweet revenge on who you slept with

Won't come any closer

I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride, to see nothing in the light
Or turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off

[Chorus]
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom

[Verse 2]
The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to breaking, bending
Or taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero
Well, I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
The wheels are cranking, turning, it's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal that's nonexistent
It's nonexistent, but we just keep believing

To find perfection in my pride, to see nothing in the light
And turn it off in all my spite

And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off

When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

You are the only exception

It's a circle, a mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore
Where's your gavel? Your jury?
What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me
Well, sentence me to another life

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
’Cause you know we're not the same
We're not the same
Oh, we're not the same

We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good
It's good, it's good

One, two, three

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, (she caught him by the mouth)
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Oh, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would

And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged

Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like

Well I refuse, (I refuse, I refuse!)

Coiled up on the dirty ground

She lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
""It's all about the exposure
The lens,"" I told her
The angles were all wrong, now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle

I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride, to see nothing in the light
Or turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off

[Chorus]
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom

[Verse 2]
The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to breaking, bending
Or taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero
Well, I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
The wheels are cranking, turning, it's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal that's nonexistent
It's nonexistent, but we just keep believing

When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

She lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
It's all about the exposure
The lens I told her
The angles were all wrong now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

[Chorus]
Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da

[Verse 2]
So one day he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick
And the clock struck twelve
Well, make sure
To build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

Well, you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic
If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hands
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
You can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah
[Chorus]
(You'll be better of without me now)
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole

I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
Or turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off

[Chorus]
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

[Verse 2]
The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to breaking, bending
Taking shortcuts and false illusions
Just to come out the hero
Well, I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
The wheels are cranking, turning
It's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal that's nonexistent
It's nonexistent but we just keep believing

Disguised as a smile, well

'Cause hope, for me, was a place uncharted
And overgrown

Won't come any closer

When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

But I don't see you around anymore
I go to all the same places, not even a trace of you
Your days are numbered at twenty-four

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm getting bored waiting 'round for you
We're not getting any younger and I
Won't look back 'cause there's no use
It's time to move forward
[Chorus]
I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

[Verse 2]
I try not to think of what might happen
When your reality, it finally cuts through
Well, as for me, I got out and I'm on the road
The worst part is that this, this, this could be you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know it too, you can't run from your shame
You're not getting any younger and time
Keeps passing by, but you wave it away
It's time to roll over

I feel no sympathy

You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

[Bridge]
And all the best lies
They are told with fingers tied
So cross them tight
Won't you promise me tonight
If it's the last thing you do, you'll get out

[Chorus]
I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time, got no time
I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I am going away for a while
But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Traveling endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles

[Verse 2]
Now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds?
So I can find someone to rely on

Full speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless

The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
We should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me

I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride, to see nothing in the light
Or turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off

[Chorus]
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom

[Verse 2]
The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to breaking, bending
Or taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero
Well, I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
The wheels are cranking, turning, it's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal that's nonexistent
It's nonexistent, but we just keep believing

And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom

[Bridge]
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride, to see nothing in the light
And turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off, just turn it off
Again
Again, again

[Chorus]
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom7Embed"

When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

When your reality, it finally cuts through

And we just go in circles

If I'm a bad person you don't like me
Well, I guess I'll make my own way
It's a circle, a mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore
Where's your gavel? Your jury?
What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge but if you're gonna judge me
Well, sentence me to another life

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
'Cause you know we're not the same
We're not the same
Oh, we're not the same
Yeah, the friends who stuck together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good
It's good
It's good

Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you sir

Well, that's it
We hope you enjoyed your night
We are Paramore
We'll see you around, Chicago!

[Verse 1: Hayley Williams & Crowd]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus: Hayley Williams & Crowd]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could then you know you would

Just feels so good

There's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

In the town that we could call our own
Going back to get away
After everything has changed

When we were so alive? (Everything has changed)
Do you remember that?

Could you help me push aside

So we stand here now
And no one knows us at all

And going back won't feel the same

Alright, I wanna see you move it
C'mon, c'mon

[Verse 1]
And here we go again
With all the things we said
And not a minute spent
To think that we'd regret
So we just take it back
These words and hold our breath
Forget the things we swore we meant

[Chorus: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
And I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
Well, I'm not

[Spoken]
Alright, you're looking good but you can do better

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
Here we go again
With all the things we did
And now I'm wondering
Just who would I have been
To be the one attached
At all time to your hip
Forget the things we swore we meant

Man, it is so good to be back here
Thank you! Thank you for hanging out with us
As you might know, this is The Final RIOT!
The last one that you're gonna get
And in case you don't know already
My friends, I'll tell you
We are Paramore!
So let's get this show going, everyone
Two hands in the air
As high as they might
Look at that
That's the Chicago I remember [Laughter]
I see some jazz fingers [Laughter]
What about this?
Can you snap your fingers with me?
Feel that rhythm?
That's nice
Alright

[Verse 1]
I'm sitting in a room
Made up of only big white walls and in the halls
There's people looking through the window in the door
They know exactly what we're here for

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look up, just let them think
There's no place else you'd rather be
You're always on display
For everyone to watch and learn from
Don't you know by now?
You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

[Chorus]
And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh, oh, open wide
'Cause this is your night, so smile
'Cause you'll go out in style
Hands up!
You'll go out in style

Separate from the world

There's no place else you'd rather be

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out

I waited eight long months, she finally set him free

Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me but I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, was never my intention to brag

Hit that, hit that snare

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

I'm sitting in a room
Made up of only big white walls
And in the hall
There are people looking through
The window in the door
They know exactly what we're here for
Don't look up, just let them think
There's no place else you'd rather be
You're always on display
For everyone to watch and learn from
Don't you know by now?

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

[Chorus]
And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh, oh, open wide
'Cause this is your night so smile
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style

[Verse 2]
If you let me, I could
I'd show you how to build your fences, set restrictions
Separate from the world
The constant battle that you hate to fight
Just blame the limelight
Don't look up, just let them think
There's no place else you'd rather be

And now you can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

'Cause this is your night so smile

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, you're asking for it
With every breath that you breathe in
Just breathe it in
Yeah, yeah, well, you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it
Yeah, yeah, well, you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it

[Chorus]
And it's obvious that you're dying, dying

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
And steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
There's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right

Tell me where our time went
And if it was time well spent
Just don’t let me fall asleep
Feeling empty again

'Cause I fear I might break
And I fear I can't take it
Tonight I’ll lie awake
Feeling empty

Without you
Feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you

And I had to let them go
Okay, Anaheim, listen up, okay?
I need you all to do me a little favor
You ended up sort of thin
When the band comes back in
For the end of the bridge
I need every last one of you
To participate
Take in a deep breath, open your mouth real wide
And let out the last couple words of this part, okay?
And I want it to be so loud
That everyone in the park
Hears of much more fun we're having than they are
Can you do that with me?
Let’s see what you've got, Anaheim!
Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
Well, I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty

Now I think they might of heard you

I think we have an emergency

If you thought I'd leave, then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on
So are you listening?
So are you watchin' me?
If you thought I'd leave, then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on
This is an emergency
So are you listening?
And I can't pretend
That I don't see this

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive

Made up of only big white walls
And in the hall
There are people looking through

There's no place else you'd rather be

For everyone to watch and learn from
Don't you know by now?

Because this road is all you'll ever have

And oh, oh, open wide

'Cause you'll go out in style

If you let me, I could
I'd show you how to build your fences, set restrictions
Separate from the world

Hit that, hit that snare

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

Too alarming now to talk it out
Take your pictures down, shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
And use that evidence and race it around

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

[Verse 2]
Don't the best of them bleed it out?
While the rest of them peter out?
And truth or consequence, say it aloud
And use that evidence and race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

I heard you driving in my car
Then in a frozen bar
And I claimed I didn't care for you
But your verse got trapped inside my head
Over and over again
You played yourself to death in me

[Verse 2]
I thought I'd drop you easily
But that was not to be
You burrowed like a summer tic
So you invade my sleep
And confuse my dreams
Turn my nights to sleepless itch

[Chorus]
Stuck on you 'till the end of time
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
Stuck on you 'till the end of time
You've got me paralyzed

Holding on the telephone
I hear your mid-range moan
You're everywhere inside my room
Even when I'm alone
I hear your mellow drone
You're everywhere inside of me

When you beam it out
All across the sky
No, I can't escape

I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away

[Interlude]
How long? How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?

Tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

[Verse 2]
Broken bottles under children's feet
And bodies strewn across the dead-end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall

[Chorus]
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday

[Verse 3]
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

When fact is fiction and T.V., reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink, while tomorrow they die, yeah

No, sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why?
All the possibilities, well, I was wrong

[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try
Holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard

And I'll always be just so (So) inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me

Hit that, hit that snare

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

Oh no, I just keep on falling
Back to the same old
And where's hope when misery comes crawling?
Oh, my way-ay
With your faith, you'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
And kill off this common sense of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And it takes acquired minds
To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
We don't need the headlines, we just want
(We want the airwaves back)
(We want the airwaves back)

Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
And steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
But second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
There's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

No, you were finished long before

Why don't you stand up?
Be a man about it?
Fight with your bare hands about it now?

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She got it out for me but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, was never my intention to brag
And steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could then you know you would
God, it just feels so
Just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
There's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

Pretty soon, you won't remember a thing
And I'll be distant, the stars reminiscing
Your heart's been wasted on me

Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through

Time is changing everything
Forgetting all the memories
And I'm forced into you just 'cause you're into me

But I can't stay and you know I won't wait

Hit that, hit that snare

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

Oh no, I just keep on falling
Back to the same old
And where's hope when misery comes crawling?
Oh, my way-ay
With your faith, you'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
And kill off this common sense of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And it takes acquired minds
To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
We don't need the headlines, we just want
(We want the airwaves back)
(We want the airwaves back)

[Chorus]
Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live
Like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me but I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
And steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way

They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right

Hit that, hit that snare

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Bridge]
I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

[Chorus]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good

And convinced yourself that it's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

And oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

Well, you always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything

With chances taken, hope embraced
And have I told you?

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

We've learned to run from
Anything uncomfortable

And no one ever has to know
That inside we're broken

To count my tears and kill these fears

My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy
My little decoy

[Verse 2]
Live your life inside a dream
Time is changing everything
Forgetting all the memories
And I'm forced into you just 'cause you're into me
Well hey, hey baby, it's never too late
When I'm gone you won't remember a thing
But I can't stay and you know I won't wait
I was gone from the very first day
You might also like[Chorus]
You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
I'm not sorry at all (not sorry at all, not sorry, no)
I won't be sorry at all (not sorry at all, not sorry, no)
I'd do it over again

[Outro]
Don't look so blue, my little decoy
You should've seen right through, my little decoy
You've never been so used, my little decoy
And so I'm using you, my little decoy4Embed"
