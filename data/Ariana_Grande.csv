Uh

[Verse]
How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?
Aren't you really s'posed to know that shit?
Feel it in your bones and own that shit? I don't know
Then I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks
Wonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling
Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me
Wonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care
I'd rather tell the truth (Truth)
Than make it worse for you, mm (You)

[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
Baby, would I still be your lover?
Would you want me there?
If the moon went dark tonight
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would you be the one on mine?You might also like3Embed"

I can't believe I'm finally movin' through my fears
At least, I know how hard we tried, both you and me
Didn't we? Didn't we?

[Verse 1]
I fall asleep cryin'
You turn up the TV
You don't wanna hear me
One more sleepless night
Big day in the morning
So, I take my time to self-soothe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby

[Verse 2]
I made it so easy
Spent so much on therapy
Blamed my own codependency
But you didn't even try
When you finally did, it was at the wrong time
Won't abandon me again for you and I, I

When we're all born, Saturn's somewhere
And the Saturn cycle takes around about twenty-nine years
That's when we gotta wake up and smell the coffee
Because if we've just been sort of relying on our cleverness
Or relying—, you know, just kind of floating along
Saturn comes along and hits you over the head
Hits you over the head, hits you over the head, and says, ""Wake up""
Aha, it's time for you to get real about life and sort out who you really are

Ooh
Get me out of this loop, yeah, yeah

Now, now she's in my bed, mm-mm, layin' on your chest
Now I'm in my head, wonderin' how it ends

I'll be the first to say, ""I'm sorry""
Now you got me feelin' sorry

Hope you feel alright when you're in her

Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is—

[Bridge]
And I know it's simply meant to be
And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you I'm not usually
Like this, shit, it's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy

[Chorus]
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him (Oh)
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine6Embed"

We could go pop all the champagne in California
We could have omakase in Tokyo if you wanna
Hypothetically, we (We) could do (Do)
Anything that we'd like
We could hit up all the slopes in matching snowsuits
We could hang out at the Louvre all night if you want to
We could spend every dime
But I don't want (Want) anything ('Thing)
But more time

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny, but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You hit just like the first sip of wine after a long day
You hit like my biggеst fan when I hear what the critiquеs say
You hit just like a green light when I'm stuck runnin' real late

You can overcome that
You know? It-it's very easy
And as I told her, never go to bed without kissin' goodnight

How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?
Aren't you really s'posed to know that shit?
Feel it in your bones and own that shit? I don't know
Then I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks
Wonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling
Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me
Wonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care
I'd rather tell the truth (Truth)
Than make it worse for you, mm (You)

[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
Baby, would I still be your lover?
Would you want me there?
If the moon went dark tonight
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?

[Verse 1]
I fall asleep cryin'
You turn up the TV
You don't wanna hear me
One more sleepless night
Big day in the morning
So, I take my time to self-soothe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby

[Verse 2]
I made it so easy
Spent so much on therapy
Blamed my own codependency
But you didn't even try
When you finally did, it was at the wrong time
Won't abandon me again for you and I, I

When we're all born, Saturn's somewhere
And the Saturn cycle takes around about twenty-nine years
That's when we gotta wake up and smell the coffee
Because if we've just been sort of relying on our cleverness
Or relying—, you know, just kind of floating along
Saturn comes along and hits you over the head
Hits you over the head, hits you over the head, and says, ""Wake up""
Aha, it's time for you to get real about life and sort out who you really are

How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic
So independent, tell me why
'Cause the boy is mine, mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (Over)
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

[Chorus]
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
Thе boy is mine
Watch me take my timе
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine

[Verse 2]
Please know this ain't what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come through in a sticky situation
Say, ""It's fine"" (It's fine)
Happens all the time

[Bridge]
And I know it's simply meant to be
And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you I'm not usually
Like this, shit, it's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy

[Chorus]

In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right

Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (No one can tell you nothin')
Come on and walk this way through the fire (Don't care what's on their mind)
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like

""Yes, and?""
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend

In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (No one can tell you nothin')
Come on and walk this way through the fire (Don't care what's on their mind)
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like

Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, ""What's next?""
""Yes, and?""

[Verse 1]
I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't be mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up
Put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt
Then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I woulda listened
But now, I'm with somebody else
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up
Bet it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but

[Chorus]
You will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (Oh-oh)

Mm, ah-hey, yeah

I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn, mm-mm
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want

But we're still goin' the wrong way

So, we're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
And honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home, baby

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing

Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger (Ooh), oh, how you hold me (Aah)
I get a chill inside (Ooh)
And nothing frightens me, baby (Ayy), more

[Verse: Ariana Grande]
Is it love when so easily you said goodbye?
Is it love when we've given up before we tried? Mm
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry, and cry?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You're a dangerous love (Ooh)
Maybe you're no good for me, darling (Aah)
'Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here (Ooh)
Then I'd rather you leave me lonely

I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby

Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby

I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you

Will I ever love the same way again? (Way again)
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? (Next life)
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady)
But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?

Will you be thеre? (Will you be there?)
Can I still love you? (Can I, can I, babe?)
Not yet healed or ready (Not ready)
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
[Verse 2: The Weeknd, Ariana Grande & Both]
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (You can see right through it)
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills (Oh yeah, yeah)
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms (Your arms)
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table

Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby (Hey)
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? (Oh, hey)
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby

But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again (Woah)

But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? (Ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby

But baby, I don't need no savior

But I kind of like the way I
Feel when I just don't give a fuck
Oh, I forgot to mention
I'll be there in five

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't really need to talk too much
Show each other what we know
I got other ways to catch you up
Couldn't do it on the phone
So can you keep it secret?

This ain't no game won't play with you (Oh hey)
This time I know I'll stay with you
Just promise you won't say nothin'

'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (You can see right through it)

Ah, hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know I be on some bullshit
Know I be driving you crazy
But I know you love how I whip it
You can only stay mad for a minute
So come here and give me some kisses
You know I'm very delicious
You know I'm very impatient
Might change my mind, so don't keep me waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wonder, baby, if you're gonna stay
Even if, one day, I lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy
I just wanna tell you directly
So, boy, let me know if you ready

[Chorus]
Are you down? What's up?

It's been way long overdue
Just like these inches down my back
Usually don't let people touch it
But tonight, you get a pass
Spend my dimes and spend my time
To keep it real, sometimes it's tracks

I love the taste of you in the morning
Keep me warm and
Nothin' else, nothin' more important
Makes me wanna believe in love (Mmm)
I love the thought of us in the evening
Crave the feeling
The way you feel, somethin' 'bout it's healing
I'm praying we don't fuck this up (Ah-ah-ah, babe)

[Pre-Chorus]
Others that I've had had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

[Chorus]
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? (Ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?

Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too (Too)
I love the thought of you never leavin' (No)
Days repeatin'
Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Others that I've had had to impress me before (Ooh)
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

[Chorus]
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby

It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothin' from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

I wanna love me (Ooh)

Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view

Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

[Verse 2]
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine

Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawin', got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

Alright, well, we're gonna need y'all to sing it as loud as you can
Are you ready?

Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)

Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings, sing

Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot

(After laughter comes tears)
Na-na-na-na, after (After laughter comes tears)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I'm sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I'm not gon' make it very far
Happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo (Ah), woo (Ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I've been through, I can't lie
Woo, baby (Ah), woo (Ah)

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

[Verse 2]
I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin' on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it's shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
Baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

At the end of the day, boy

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don't wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain't no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I (Kiss you)
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be (N-A-S-A)

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space (I'ma, I'ma need)
You know I'm a star; space (I'ma need space), yeah

You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align
Ah yeah, yeah

You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me? Yeah
Said, I got you, I got you dreamin' (Ah)
You close your eyes and you're screamin' (Ah)
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it (Ah-ah)
Know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
Already know what I'm thinkin', boy

Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

Here's the thing
You're in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head
That you are trying to but cannot fix
Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself
I love you, this has gone on way too long
Enough is enough
I'm two blocks away, I'm coming over

[Verse 1]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seein' what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus]
Fallin', fallin', but I never thought you'd leave me
Fallin', fallin', needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't buddin'
Everything you are made you everything you aren't
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can't hold that shit against you (Uh)

This one's for my mama

[Verse]
If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it, baby
Can't pretend anymore, yeah (Huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Said, I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart (Huh)
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are, sing

[Chorus]
(This is the part when I say I don't want ya)
I'm stronger than I've been before
(This is) The part when I break free
('Cause I can't resist it no more) Let's go
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Bridge]
No, no, babe
Ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Oh, baby

[Intro: Aaron Simon Gross & Ariana Grande]
Hi, my name is Kathy Najimy
And this album is for sophisticated consumers of art
Three and a half hours
What I was going to say is
Goodbye for now, the show's over, bye

[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

Step up, the two of us, nobody knows us
Get in the car like, ""Skrrt""
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep 'til noon
Me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never
Act this regular

Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

[Chorus]
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world

[Verse 2]
Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, ""Ooh""
Feels like forever, baby, I never
Thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can’t help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night

You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears

[Verse 1]
Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I’m sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I’m not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
And I won't say I’m feeling fine
After what I been through, I can’t lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

[Verse 2]
I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin’ on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it’s shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles

Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'

She's sweet in the day, but freaky when night come (Tell 'em)
It's mine, invest it (Uh); I spend it on necklace (Uh)
I got the cash if I don't get credit (Uh)
And I'm well respected so she feel protected
So scratch all the exes (Ex), it's next like contestants (Woo)

When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot

I've been on a roll, where you been?
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
Is your GPS even on, where you been?
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I swerve both ways, dichotomy

[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin
How you hit the club and you barely got in?
Then we hit the bank, making them investments for the win, oh

Said, I been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)

Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful

'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

Took a deep breath like, ""Ooh""
Feels like forever, baby, I never

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can’t help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover

Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under

I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screamin’ my name

At the end of the day, boy
You know that I'm 'bout to wake up with you

Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops, surprise, surprise

I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin’ and able

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, boy, I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin’ from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Damn, damn)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""

When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet

Ain't no budget when I'm on the set

And for Pete, I'm so thankful

Shawty, you can get blazed

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I can't believe that you are here
I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Once I have you, I will
Never let you, never let you—
Once I have you I will
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you—

Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep ('Sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (If you can believe)
Mm, you're such a dream to me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh), wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
""Excuse me, um, I love you""
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch 'em other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like, ""I love you—,"" who starts a conversation like that? Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mm, boy

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, ""What happened? Why you?""
But when I see you in my dreams, shh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it (Ooh, hey)

Before you speak, don't move

Back to you, back to you, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time

[Verse 1]
I get tired of your no-shows
You get tired of my control (Yuh)
They keep telling me to let go
But I don't really let go when I say so (Yuh, yuh)
I keep giving people blank stares (Yuh)
I'm so different when you're not there (Yuh)
It's like something out of Shakespeare
Because I'm really not here when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to fight our energy
But every time I think I'm free (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?

[Verse 2]
Just when I get on a new wave (Yuh)
Boy, you look at me and I slip outta my lace
They keep calling me a head-case
'Cause I can't make a good case why we can't change

[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to fight our energy (Yee)
But every time I think I'm free (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me (Mm) back to you? (Back to you, baby)
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm

[Verse 2]

Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud

I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you

You can feel it, feel it
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
They say my system is overloaded
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
I'm too much in my head, did you notice? Mm-mm
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down; Down)
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no time to deny it (Yeah), that is why we talking about it (Get better)
Yeah, we talking about it (Get better, get better)
To deal with it, don't try to get by it (Get better, get better)
Ain't no time to deny it (Get better, get better)
So we had to sit down and just write it (Get better)

[Verse 2]
Want you to get better (Woo!)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mm-mm?
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this? (Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
(Down, down, down, down)
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is (Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
Before I'm gone

Fete tatuate care intră în bucluc
Gene și diamante, bancomate
Îmi cumpăr toate lucrurile preferate
Am trecut prin multe belele, ar trebui să fiu tristă
Cine ar fi crezut că m-ar fi transformat într-o sălbatică
Mai degrabă nu m-aș atașa de tine
Îmi scriu cecurile așa cum îmi scriu versurile, da

La încheietură, nu te uita, gâtul e strălucitor
Am depozite mari, rujul meu strălucește
Îți place părul meu? Mulțumesc, l-am cumpărat!
Îl văd, îmi place, îl vreau, îl cumpăr

Îmi place, îl cumpăr, îmi place, îl cumpăr
Îmi place, îl cumpăr, îmi place, îl cumpăr
Îți place părul meu? Mulțumesc, l-am cumpărat!
Îl văd, îmi place, îl vreau, îl cumpăr

Port un inel, dar nu voi fi o doamnă
Am cumpărat diamante pentru târfele mele
Aș preferă să-mi răsfăț prietenii cu bogățiile mele
Cred că sunt dependentă de cumpărături
Cine a spus că banii nu poate rezolva probleme
Probabil că nu a avut suficienți bani
Ei întreabă ""Pe care?"", eu spun ""Nu, eu le vreau pe toate""
Fericirea are același preț ca pantofii

Îmi place, îl cumpăr, îmi place, îl cumpăr
Îți place părul meu? Mulțumesc, l-am cumpărat!
Îl văd, îmi place, îl vreau, îl cumpăr

Chitanțele sunt lungi ca numerele de telefon
Dacă nu sunt bani, atunci numărul e greșit
Cardul negru e cardul meu de afaceri
Și dă tonul pentru mine
Nu vreau să mă laud, dar pun multe în coș
Când văd rafturile, puse unele peste celelalte
Te duci la magazin și înapoi
Nu-i nimic, am energie
Tot timpul reușesc în viață
Uite-te la gâtul meu, uite-te la jet
Am mulți bani așa că dă-mi respect
Nu sunt bani suficienți bani pentru mine
Dacă asta vreau, asta primesc

Îmi place, îl cumpăr, îmi place, îl cumpăr
Îmi place, îl cumpăr, îmi place, îl cumpăr
Îți place părul meu? Mulțumesc, l-am cumpărat!

Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me

Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh), wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
""Excuse me, um, I love you""
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch 'em other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like, ""I love you—,"" who starts a conversation like that? Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh, no), wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mm, boy

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, ""What happened? Why you?""
But when I see you in my dreams, shh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it (Ooh, hey)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No, I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (Does this end?)
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me
To me, mm, boy, to me

Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional (Woah), yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Verse 2]
Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition, I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire

Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar

But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you

So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily

Now, if it all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? (What?)
If my Benz turned back to public transportation (Swerve, swerve)
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waitin'? (What?)
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player, too, you know I have some girls missionary (Ooh)
My black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go (I got you)

You should know (Oh), I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change; Woah)
I'm always gonna stay (I'm always gonna stay; Oh)

You're so different, no one compares
And if you never change (B-I-G Sean Don)

I'll always be right there (Yeah)

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing

How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up, total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind? (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Big Sean]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on (Uh-uh), mm, hold on, ayy (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tockin', lip lockin'
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets (Swerve)
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up (Hold up), I know love can be a beach with no shore (Shore)
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four (Four)
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest (Oddest) couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just bein' honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'

Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'

Can't hear them, no, 'cause I—

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing

Dangerous love (Ooh)
You're no good for me, darling (Aah)
Yeah, you turn me away (Ooh)
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger (Ooh), oh, how you hold me (Aah)
I get a chill inside (Ooh)
And nothing frightens me, baby (Ayy), more

[Verse: Ariana Grande]
Is it love when so easily you said goodbye?
Is it love when we've given up before we tried? Mm
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry, and cry?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You're a dangerous love (Ooh)
Maybe you're no good for me, darling (Aah)
'Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here (Ooh)
Then I'd rather you leave me lonely
Even though it hurts

I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you

[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road

I just broke up with my ex
Now I'm out here single, I don't really know what's next

And I know they will be comin' from the right and the left
Left, left

You're the one I'm feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don't normally say this but goddamn, you the best
Best, best

Is it love when we've given up before we tried? Mm
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry, and cry?

So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

You're a dangerous love (Ooh)
Maybe you're no good for me, darling (Aah)

I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby

I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere

Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown (No, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's a hundred degrees, gotta get out (Out)
Ain't no ice or no chills, no snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey-oh
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah

In our cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doin' what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon (Moon)
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?

Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally, the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? (What?)
If my Benz turned back to public transportation (Swerve, swerve)
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waitin'? (What?)
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary (Ooh)
My black book of number's thicker than the dictionary and Bible

I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

'Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flyin' away, away from me

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year, can you

[Chorus]
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow in California

[Verse 2]
Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away, mm-mm
See, I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

If he will be, if he will be here

Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change

If you stand here behind me
And you call me a man
And you’re counting on me to come through
You should know that I’ll give you the best that I can
But we all have a little more homework to do

If you’re walking beside me
And you wanna be friends
You should know I’m depending on you
So you gotta hang in there till the whole story ends
Cause we all have a little more homework to do

Cause I’ve been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn’t chime
But I’m not ready to put down my pencil just set
There are too many answers that I didn’t get
I need a little less pressure and a little more time

I’m trying to follow
I’m trying to lead
I’m trying to find what is true
But if you’re going to stand with me
Then you have to concede
That we all have a little more homework to do

How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up, total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind? (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Big Sean]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on (Uh-uh), mm, hold on, ayy (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tockin', lip lockin'
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets (Swerve)
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up (Hold up), I know love can be a beach with no shore (Shore)
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four (Four)
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest (Oddest) couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just bein' honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

[Chorus]
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

[Verse 2]
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know ""sorry"" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself

[Verse 1]
Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, ""Is this too good to be true?""

[Pre-Chorus]
That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

[Chorus]
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
You might also like[Verse 2]
As I'm layin' down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew

[Pre-Chorus]
I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

[Chorus]
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

They don't understand
They don't understand, no (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no (Uh-uh, here we go)

[Pre-Chorus]
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

[Chorus]
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told

[Post-Chorus]
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear (Uh-uh, here we go)
You think you know, but you don't have no idea (Uh-uh, here we go)
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love (Uh-uh, here we go)

The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming (Uh-uh, here we go)
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea (Uh-uh, uh-uh)

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Verse 2: Fedez]
Io coi jeans sempre uguali, tu giacca Armani
Le firme sui muri, tu capi firmati
Gio-gio-giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Tu i viaggi, i regali, le fedi nuziali
Noi al massimo a scambiarci le fedine penali
Gio-gio-giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Gio-gio-giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Mai stato un tipo da spiaggia o da bagnasciuga
Meglio l'uomo con l'ucc− (Woo) che con la tartaruga
