I don't mind burnin' bridges, love my enemies, center peace
Call that bitch my kid, she ain't no kin to me

Need you for the old me, need you for my sanity
Need you to remind me where I come from
Can you remind me of my gravity?
Ground me when I'm spiralin', tumblin', plummetin' down to Earth
You keep me down to Earth
Call me on my bullshit
Lie to me and say my booty gettin' bigger even if it ain't
Love me even if it rain
Love me even if it pain you
I know I be difficult (Right)
You know I be difficult (Right)
You know shit get difficult to

[Chorus]
Open your heart up
Hopin' I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me, but I
Believe you when you say it like that (Say it like that)

Maybe she can come help you
Maybe she can come lick you
After we're done, what's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I've been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh, no, she didn't, ooh, yes, I did
Oh, no, she didn't, I'll do it again

Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me

Hey gang
How y'all feelin' gang?
Never had anybody up there before
Nice to meet you from afar
So we gon' sing this next one it's about my ex-fiance
Who has still blocked me on everything and will not talk to me
He's from [?]
His father is here
So we gon' sing it for him

[Verse 1]
Took a long vacation
No make-up, just JAY-Z
You were balls-deep, now we beefin'
Had me butt-naked at the MGM
So wasted, screamin', ""Fuck that""
Blurry now, but I meant it then
Hurry now, baby, stick it in
'Fore the memories get to kickin' in

[Pre-Chorus]
Too late, I don't wanna lose

[Chorus]
What's left of you
How am I supposed to tell you
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
Nobody gets me like
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)

Now I'm stuck fuckin' on a deadbeat
If I'm real, I deserve less
If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
I pretend when I'm with a man it's you

I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present

Last night, I cried

[Verse]
Give me a second, give me a minute
Nah, lil' bitch, can't let you finish
Yeah, that's right, I need commissions on mine
All that sauce you got from me
All that shit I gave for free
I want it back, want it back
This ain't no warnin' shot
Case all you hoes forgot
Know you been more than lost
Without me, I'm so
Comin' back, I'm so greasy
Ex-nigga, he so needy
Punk ass tried to replace me, but the stakes is too high
They can't survive off mini-me
I'm talkin' pedigree
Ain't no writers, that's just me
Ain't no spiteful, I'm just tea
Can't hate a bitch for free
Talkin' I'm off the bench like Brady
I'm pressin' niggas like KD, it's up
Yeah, nigga, it's up to me
Remind you of Dеlla Reese
So classic, that ass so fat, it look natural, it's not
I talk bullshit a lot
No more fuck-shit, I'm done
Damn right, I'm thе one
Damn right, I'm the one
Comin' back, she so candid
Comin' back snatched like bandit
Comin' back, this ain't canned shit
I'm organic with my fresh squeezed
I'm dumpin' like press squeeze
I'm horny like, ""Suck these""
So daring like, ""Touch me""
And all the petty shit aside
All the funny shit aside
I just want what's mine
Mine, oh
I just want what's mine
This ain't no warnin' shot
Case all you hoes forgot
And I cried and cried
Said what's on my mind

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

[Chorus]
I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

Shift eyes, they tell me you lyin'

Squeezin' too tight, boy, you're losin' me

Get around you and I regress

Tryna find deeper meanin' in nonsense

Tired of anticipating the worst yet
Still anticipating the worst (Worst)

Everything disgusting, conversation is so boring

""I hate her,"" ""I don't agree,"" ""I did it first""
I give a fuck
I just wanna fuck, eat, sleep, love happy
Can you make me happy? Can you keep me happy?

Can you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?

I need humanity
Y'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity
Craving humanity
Y'all lack humanity, I need humanity

Everybody wanna be beautiful, scared of the unusual
Scared of givin' mutual respect, all that you hate
You reflect all that godlike, you forget how to love somebody

Too late for us
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?

[Verse 1]
I been gone so long, I don't know where I'm going
You be on my phone, talkin' 'bout what's my problem?
Had to go alone to get it how I wanted
Had to be alone to figure out how I should be loved
And if it's just us, is that enough?
Is it bad that I want more?

[Chorus]
Is it too late for us?
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
We both scared of love
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?

[Verse 2]
See, bust it like a toolie in your waistband
Bust it like that booty too big and you need two hands
Bust it like you catchin' a body and you in G stance
Bust it like it's casual Friday and you herе to dance
Call bluff, I know what's up
Can't get enough
Is it bad that I want morе?

Mmm, pressure, I won't learn my lesson
I want you to stretch it

I gotta know
Is it bad that I want more?

So done with you
Nobody hurt me like you do
Every time you break my heart, it feel new
Every time I fall apart, I call you
I just wanna be loved
And loving you sucks

How do I deal with rejection?
I'm dealing with a lot of rejection right now
It makes me feel very small
Oh, that's great
If nobody wants you, you're free

[Verse 1]
Tried to wash all of my shit away
Tried to wash all my emotions
Need a few brews, need a palm tree
I be drinkin' in private, don't call me to party, though
Fuck on your nigga for cardio
Too good, he really fell in love right away
I put my feelings on layaway, I'm

Done being used, done playing stupid
Done faking cool
(I don't want none of that shit, I don't want it)
Done being screwed, done feeling clueless
That's how you do
(I don't want none of that shit, got me runnin' so)

[Chorus]

Lately, I feel less cool as before
(Nobody under my garter belt)
(Nobody out here to tell me I'm special)
Made you check your bullshit at the door
(Got an appetite, hungry to feed my ego)
(Nobody 'round me to be my hero)
Always on my mind, trust is hard to find
Everything reminds me of us
I just want my sanity back
Better than being your enemy
(Better than letting go, scared of that, oh)

When you do your best you ca—, I done told you
When you do your best, hell, that's all you can do
You and me and anybody else
So they always start talkin'

[Verse 1: SZA]
Runnin' away from where I'm from
Never can stay with no one
Lovin' you almost feels like something
When no one's around me
You lost and found me
I was surrounded
With open, open, open

[Chorus: SZA & Travis Scott]
Open arms (Ooh)
Open arms
You keep me open, I'm so devoted
You keep me open (Ooh)
Open arms
I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you

[Verse 2: SZA]
Spent your life bein' hopeless
Chokin' on insecurity
I know ownership's bad
But please put a leash on me anyway
Who needs self-esteem anyway?
I hate myself to make you stay
Push me away, I'll be right here

No matter what come between us, yeah, I decided
I'm forever ridin', we forever guided
Pull up on an opp, hit his curb up, slide it (Brr)
Notice when you mad, ain't no words, just silence
Drew my favorite color, now you seein' every shade of me
You say that I'm trippin', I hit back like, ""Where you takin' me?""
Locked in for life, on God, no replacin' me
Consequences, repercussions, karma keep on changin' me
For you, I try
Face card, valid ID
C'est la vie, go to Paris
It ain't five-star, it ain't me
Over-solid, keep it concrete
I'ma bet it on you, a whole fee
Just don't switch sides
I could fire piece your wrist, AP
Through the ups and downs and all the heat
Take a turn and tell you what it be
Backshots make you feel relief
Anything, just don't you ever leave
[Outro: SZA, Travis Scott, & Both]
I guess I gotta go (Ooh)
I guess it's time to go
I gotta let you go

You keep me open
Gotta let you go, gotta let you go

Makin’ young ladies scream is my specialty

I don't mind who's watchin', get to pushin' your wig back
I don’t mind burnin’ bridges, love my enemies, center peace
Call that bitch my kid, she ain't no kin to me
Gotta watch how you whisper when you around me, though
Give a fuck what you prefer, I’m too profound to go
Back and forth with no average dork
It goes spells and sorcery, hug your rosariеs
I don't mind competition, it is what it is
You don't mind second fiddle, that's why you a bitch
You don’t think for yoursеlf and that's none of my business
You take it I dish it, I'm genie, three wishes
Better watch how you think out loud if it's 'bout me, though
Got a couple that's outside, they kill about me, though

Summer's over, and the money gone
I miss my mama when the tide is low
Moon corrals us to the water and my daddy calls on his
Favorite daughter for a host of loving words, I might oblige him
If the money right, is the pussy good?
I keep it tight for the right one
Save it all for the right one
Call it perfect timing

Make it bounce, baby, do a little more
I've been wiped out like three times
Beat that shit, call me nine lives

I can't stop till I rеach my

Time waits for nary man
I rеgret all the things we said in haste
Knowing the golden hour awaits for me
Twilight calls my name
Wrist froze, let the ice call my name too loud
Double zeroes by my name now
""And it all makes sense in the end,"" that's what they say to us
Spending our time smoking that, angel dust

Blame someone so blame yourself

Ooh

[Verse 1]
I'll touch that fire for you
I do that three, four times again, I testify for you
I told that lie, I'd kill that bitch
I do what all of them around you scared to do, I'm not
Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
I don't got nobody, just with you right now
Tell the truth, I look better under you

[Chorus]
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
I can't just snooze and miss the moment
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do

[Verse 2]
In a droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface)
Like that white bitch with the bob, I'll be your main one (Your main one)
Lеt's take this argument back up to my place (My placе)
Sex remind you I'm nonviolent, I'm your day one (Day one)
We ain't have shit yet, it was magic, yeah
Smash and grab shit, yeah
Nasty habits take a hold when you not here
Ain't a home when you not here

Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion

Last night, I cried

[Verse]
Give me a second, give me a minute
Nah, lil' bitch, can't let you finish
Yeah, that's right, I need commissions on mine
All that sauce you got from me
All that shit I gave for free
I want it back, want it back
This ain't no warnin' shot
Case all you hoes forgot
Know you been more than lost
Without me, I'm so
Comin' back, I'm so greasy
Ex-nigga, he so needy
Punk ass tried to replace me, but the stakes is too high
They can't survive off mini-me
I'm talkin' pedigree
Ain't no writers, that's just me
Ain't no spiteful, I'm just tea
Can't hate a bitch for free
Talkin' I'm off the bench like Brady
I'm pressin' niggas like KD, it's up
Yeah, nigga, it's up to me
Remind you of Dеlla Reese
So classic, that ass so fat, it look natural, it's not
I talk bullshit a lot
No more fuck-shit, I'm done
Damn right, I'm thе one
Damn right, I'm the one
Comin' back, she so candid
Comin' back snatched like bandit
Comin' back, this ain't canned shit
I'm organic with my fresh squeezed
I'm dumpin' like press squeeze
I'm horny like, ""Suck these""
So daring like, ""Touch me""
And all the petty shit aside
All the funny shit aside
I just want what's mine
Mine, oh
I just want what's mine
This ain't no warnin' shot
Case all you hoes forgot
And I cried and cried
Said what's on my mind

I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

With a rush that feels like we committed a crime

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Split mind, don't need to decide when
Straightforward, eyes on the climbin'
I decide no matter the climate
Birthin' bitches in my third trimester
Shift eyes, they tell me you lyin'
Don't care, just lay here beside me
Hang time chasin' the rewind
Hang time

[Pre-Chorus]
I need more space and security (Security)
I need less voices, just you and me (Just you and me)
I need your touch, not your scrutiny (Scrutiny)
Squeezin' too tight, boy, you're losin' me
Boy, you're losin'

[Chorus]
Gone, gone, girl, gonе, girl
You better learn how to facе it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
Never replace her
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl

Can't think, it's too hard to process
Get around you and I regress
I decide what demons I digest
I'm just tired of repeatin', I digress
Tryna find deeper meanin' in nonsense
Tryna grow without hatin' the process
Tired of anticipating the worst yet
Still anticipating the worst (Worst)

[Pre-Chorus]
I need more space and security (Security)
I need less voices, just you and me (You and me)
I need your touch, not your scrutiny (Scrutiny)
Squeezin' too tight, boy, you're losin' me
Boy, you're losin'

[Chorus]
Gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
Never replace her
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
[Bridge]
Inward I go when there's no one around me
And memories drown me, the further I go
And ain't nobody talkin' 'bout the damage, pretendin' like it's all okay
I tried to erase, I live to escape

[Chorus]
Gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it

Your favorite athlete screamin', ""Text me back""

The lesser part of me loves all the cap
He screamin', ""Get back togеther""

Everything disgusting, conversation is so boring

""I hate her,"" ""I don't agree,"" ""I did it first""
I give a fuck
I just wanna fuck, eat, sleep, love happy
Can you make me happy? Can you keep me happy?

Can you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?

Y'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity
Craving humanity
Y'all lack humanity, I need humanity

Everybody wanna be beautiful, scared of the unusual
Scared of givin' mutual respect, all that you hate
You reflect all that godlike, you forget how to love somebody

Had to be alone to figure out how I should be loved

See, bust it like a toolie in your waistband
Bust it like that booty too big and you need two hands
Bust it like you catchin' a body and you in G stance
Bust it like it's casual Friday and you herе to dance

How do I deal with rejection?
I'm dealing with a lot of rejection right now
It makes me feel very small
Oh, that's great
If nobody wants you, you're free

[Verse 1]
Tried to wash all of my shit away
Tried to wash all my emotions
Need a few brews, need a palm tree
I be drinkin' in private, don't call me to party, though
Fuck on your nigga for cardio
Too good, he really fell in love right away
I put my feelings on layaway, I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
Done being used, done playing stupid
Done faking cool
(I don't want none of that shit, I don't want it)
Done being screwed, done feeling clueless
That's how you do
(I don't want none of that shit, got me runnin' so)

[Chorus]
Far, far like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'causе I let you define mе
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody
Far, stay far, so far

Lately, I feel less cool as before
(Nobody under my garter belt)
(Nobody out here to tell me I'm special)
Made you check your bullshit at the door
(Got an appetite, hungry to feed my ego)
(Nobody 'round me to be my hero)
Always on my mind, trust is hard to find
Everything reminds me of us
I just want my sanity back
Better than being your enemy
(Better than letting go, scared of that, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Done being used, done playing stupid
Done being cool
(I don't want none of that shit, I ain't goin')
Done getting screwed, done playing clueless
That's how you do
(I don't want none of that shit, got me runnin' so)

[Chorus]
Far, far like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'cause I let you define me
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody
Far, stay far, so far
[Bridge]
I remember when you had me upside-down
Stress me out and turn me out, it's all bad now
I remember when I wasn't so burnt out
I'd rather that than be your enemy, ready to let it go

[Chorus]
Draggin' me far, far like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'cause I let you define me
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody

Never can stay with no one
Lovin' you almost feels like something

You lost and found me

Chokin' on insecurity

But please put a leash on me anyway
Who needs self-esteem anyway?

No matter what come between us, yeah, I decided
I'm forever ridin', we forever guided
Pull up on an opp, hit his curb up, slide it (Brr)
Notice when you mad, ain't no words, just silence
Drew my favorite color, now you seein' every shade of me
You say that I'm trippin', I hit back like, ""Where you takin' me?""
Locked in for life, on God, no replacin' me
Consequences, repercussions, karma keep on changin' me
For you, I try
Face card, valid ID
C'est la vie, go to Paris
It ain't five-star, it ain't me
Over-solid, keep it concrete
I'ma bet it on you, a whole fee
Just don't switch sides
I could fire piece your wrist, AP
Through the ups and downs and all the heat
Take a turn and tell you what it be
Backshots make you feel relief
Anything, just don't you ever leave
[Outro: SZA, Travis Scott, & Both]
I guess I gotta go (Ooh)
I guess it's time to go
I gotta let you go

Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me

I don’t mind burnin’ bridges, love my enemies, center peace
Call that bitch my kid, she ain't no kin to me
Gotta watch how you whisper when you around me, though
Give a fuck what you prefer, I’m too profound to go
Back and forth with no average dork
It goes spells and sorcery, hug your rosariеs
I don't mind competition, it is what it is
You don't mind second fiddle, that's why you a bitch
You don’t think for yoursеlf and that's none of my business
You take it I dish it, I'm genie, three wishes
Better watch how you think out loud if it's 'bout me, though

Last night, I cried

[Verse]
Give me a second, give me a minute
Nah, lil' bitch, can't let you finish
Yeah, that's right, I need commissions on mine
All that sauce you got from me
All that shit I gave for free
I want it back, want it back
This ain't no warnin' shot
Case all you hoes forgot
Know you been more than lost
Without me, I'm so
Comin' back, I'm so greasy
Ex-nigga, he so needy
Punk ass tried to replace me, but the stakes is too high
They can't survive off mini-me
I'm talkin' pedigree
Ain't no writers, that's just me
Ain't no spiteful, I'm just tea
Can't hate a bitch for free
Talkin' I'm off the bench like Brady
I'm pressin' niggas like KD, it's up
Yeah, nigga, it's up to me
Remind you of Dеlla Reese
So classic, that ass so fat, it look natural, it's not
I talk bullshit a lot
No more fuck-shit, I'm done
Damn right, I'm thе one
Damn right, I'm the one
Comin' back, she so candid
Comin' back snatched like bandit
Comin' back, this ain't canned shit
I'm organic with my fresh squeezed
I'm dumpin' like press squeeze
I'm horny like, ""Suck these""
So daring like, ""Touch me""
And all the petty shit aside
All the funny shit aside
I just want what's mine
Mine, oh
I just want what's mine
This ain't no warnin' shot
Case all you hoes forgot
And I cried and cried
Said what's on my mind

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

[Chorus]
I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

Shift eyes, they tell me you lyin'

Squeezin' too tight, boy, you're losin' me

Get around you and I regress

Tired of anticipating the worst yet
Still anticipating the worst (Worst)

I just wanna fuck, eat, sleep, love happy
Can you make me happy? Can you keep me happy?

Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?

Y'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity
Craving humanity

Everybody wanna be beautiful, scared of the unusual
Scared of givin' mutual respect, all that you hate

Too late for us
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?

[Verse 1]
I been gone so long, I don't know where I'm going
You be on my phone, talkin' 'bout what's my problem?
Had to go alone to get it how I wanted
Had to be alone to figure out how I should be loved
And if it's just us, is that enough?
Is it bad that I want more?

[Chorus]
Is it too late for us?
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
We both scared of love
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?

[Verse 2]
See, bust it like a toolie in your waistband
Bust it like that booty too big and you need two hands
Bust it like you catchin' a body and you in G stance
Bust it like it's casual Friday and you herе to dance
Call bluff, I know what's up
Can't get enough
Is it bad that I want morе?

I gotta know
Is it bad that I want more?

So done with you
Nobody hurt me like you do
Every time you break my heart, it feel new
Every time I fall apart, I call you
I just wanna be loved
And loving you sucks

How do I deal with rejection?
I'm dealing with a lot of rejection right now
It makes me feel very small
Oh, that's great
If nobody wants you, you're free

[Verse 1]
Tried to wash all of my shit away
Tried to wash all my emotions
Need a few brews, need a palm tree
I be drinkin' in private, don't call me to party, though
Fuck on your nigga for cardio
Too good, he really fell in love right away
I put my feelings on layaway, I'm

Done being used, done playing stupid
Done faking cool
(I don't want none of that shit, I don't want it)
Done being screwed, done feeling clueless
That's how you do
(I don't want none of that shit, got me runnin' so)

[Chorus]

Lately, I feel less cool as before
(Nobody under my garter belt)
(Nobody out here to tell me I'm special)
Made you check your bullshit at the door
(Got an appetite, hungry to feed my ego)
(Nobody 'round me to be my hero)
Always on my mind, trust is hard to find
Everything reminds me of us
I just want my sanity back
Better than being your enemy
(Better than letting go, scared of that, oh)

Done being used, done playing stupid

When you do your best you ca—, I done told you
When you do your best, hell, that's all you can do
You and me and anybody else
So they always start talkin'

Runnin' away from where I'm from
Never can stay with no one
Lovin' you almost feels like something
When no one's around me
You lost and found me
I was surrounded
With open, open, open

Open arms (Ooh)

You keep me open, I'm so devoted
You keep me open (Ooh)

I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you

Spent your life bein' hopeless
Chokin' on insecurity
I know ownership's bad
But please put a leash on me anyway
Who needs self-esteem anyway?
I hate myself to make you stay
Push me away, I'll be right here

No matter what come between us, yeah, I decided
I'm forever ridin', we forever guided
Pull up on an opp, hit his curb up, slide it (Brr)
Notice when you mad, ain't no words, just silence
Drew my favorite color, now you seein' every shade of me
You say that I'm trippin', I hit back like, ""Where you takin' me?""
Locked in for life, on God, no replacin' me
Consequences, repercussions, karma keep on changin' me
For you, I try
Face card, valid ID
C'est la vie, go to Paris
It ain't five-star, it ain't me
Over-solid, keep it concrete
I'ma bet it on you, a whole fee
Just don't switch sides
I could fire piece your wrist, AP
Through the ups and downs and all the heat
Take a turn and tell you what it be
Backshots make you feel relief
Anything, just don't you ever leave
[Outro: SZA, Travis Scott, & Both]
I guess I gotta go (Ooh)
I guess it's time to go
I gotta let you go

Makin’ young ladies scream is my specialty
When I go da-da-da-da-da-da-da, girls get hype

I don't mind who's watchin', get to pushin' your wig back
I don’t mind burnin’ bridges, love my enemies, center peace
Call that bitch my kid, she ain't no kin to me
Gotta watch how you whisper when you around me, though
Give a fuck what you prefer, I’m too profound to go
Back and forth with no average dork
It goes spells and sorcery, hug your rosariеs
I don't mind competition, it is what it is
You don't mind second fiddle, that's why you a bitch
You don’t think for yoursеlf and that's none of my business
You take it I dish it, I'm genie, three wishes
Better watch how you think out loud if it's 'bout me, though
Got a couple that's outside, they kill about me, though
I don't need nobody help, angels surround me, though

Or did not have control, things would just, you know
I would be fatal

I'm writing this letter to let you know I'm really leaving
And no, I'm not keeping your shit
Heard you got some new homies, got some new hobbies
Even a new ho too
Maybe she can come help you
Maybe she can come lick you
After we're done, what's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I've been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh, no, she didn't, ooh, yes, I did
Oh, no, she didn't, I'll do it again

Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come with me
Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy
You know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey

[Chorus: SZA]
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why (Why)
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride (Ride, ride, ride)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it (Pussy)
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it (Pussy)
Double back, handicap, and go blind for it (Pussy)
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculatin' and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy (You not to get)
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you

But a bum nigga like you would try it (Pussy)

We ain't feelin' you, oh
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me

I will make you beg for it (Attention, all you niggas)
I wanna see you crawl (All you bitches)
I'll give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit

Run fast from my day job

Jump quick to a paycheck
Runnin' back to the strip club

No, you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)

I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was ten
Love dirty men alike

Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come with me
Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy
You know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey

[Chorus: SZA]
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why (Why)
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride (Ride, ride, ride)
You are now watching MADtv

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it (Pussy)
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it (Pussy)
Double back, handicap, and go blind for it (Pussy)
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculatin' and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy (You not to get)
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth

You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (Pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High-key, your **** is weak buddy (Pussy)
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you, oh
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me

[Bridge]
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind

[Chorus]
I will make you beg for it (Attention, all you niggas)
I wanna see you crawl (All you bitches)
I'll give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit
(Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride)
Make you beg for it, I wanted to do it all

And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh, so glad you made it, I'm so glad you could come by

Bring the gin, got the juice, bring the sin, got that too
Won't you shut up? Know you're my favorite

The feelin' is reckless, of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, all up in your lap
Like, is you comin' home? Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you here by 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man, heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man, heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You like nine to five, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday, then just send him my way

And I'll be at your door, ready to take her place

Probably came from my inner circle

Or lack thereof and I don't know who I can trust

I've been hangin' out with my high friends
And we too stoned to pay attention now

I mean really, it's same me, it's old me
You know? Same shit

Learning on the low-key, shining
Tryin' to keep to myself
But you bring me out of character

[Intro: SZA]
Hey, hey, glory child, hey

[Verse 1]
Hey, glory child, don't you worry
Stuttering and shaken out of fear
Beauty's never given in a hurry
So condescending, leave your questions here
Hey, glory child, don't you worry
I can see your skeleton so clear
Doubting's only made your visions blurry
You're better off just looking in the mirror

[Chorus]
Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today
You could come home today

[Verse 2]
I am shooting stars, don't you see me?
Watching over your every mistake
Digging out of graves is never easy
Handing you my shovel here to take
Always playing catch-me-if-you-can
Gingerbread—you heard I'm sweet to taste
Close your eyes, let go, and count to ten
I'll keep track of every moment wasted

Sometimes I crack my veins open

[Verse 2: SZA]
Sometimes I bite my lips and close my eyes
Just to pretend it's you
Long live lonely thoughts on Thursday nights
That's when I think of you
We were all thirteen once (once)
Long live tramp stamps and Pepper Ann (Pepper Ann)
You will never judge me for that (Uh-uh)
You will always love me for that (Uh-huh)

Killed a small boy once, never told no one

I can't recall the last time I took, advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway? Not me
Are you hating yourself? Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

That's my confession (Yeah, that)
You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing
That I'm beyond desperate (Yeah, that)

Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers

Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
That's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right

I'm cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder, cold shoulder

Can anyone live with Eartha Kitt?
That's not for me to decide
That's for someone who decides to live with me to decide
Not for me
But are you willing to compromise within a relationship?
To compromise? What is compromising? Compromising for what? Compromising for what reason? To compromise? For what? To compromise What is compromise?
If a man came into your life, wouldn't you want to compromise?
Hahaha, stupid, hahahaha
A man comes into my life and I have to compromise? You must think about that one again, hahahaha
A man comes into my life and you have to compromise? For what? For what? For what?
A relationship is a relationship that has to be earned! Not to compromise for
And I love relationships, I think they're fantastic
But one thing I think that's great I think is, nothing in the world more beautiful than falling in love
But falling in love for the right reasons
Falling in love for the right purpose
Falling in love, falling in love
When you fall in love, what is there to compromise about?

[Verse]
I's got to make this quick
I don't want to waste time
Make it faster, stronger, deeper
Pulled out with the passion rolled out
Roll out on the red carpet
Roll out, chariot
Friar dancing by the fire, singing
I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight, tonight
Yeah
Haven't we been here before
Haven't you heard the end of the story?
It isn't over yet
Keep patience, left side of your brain
Virtues are relative
No pain

You should just save me
Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna live how it should be
Over, what it is
Over
Can I get a heartbreak?
Over
Unstick my thoughts, unstick my heart
Unstick these words, go from the start

[Chorus]
Take me to reality
And drag me to the truth
Take me to reality, oh
Drag me to the truth

[Verse 2]
Come clean, soul
Yearning for things, are numb
Do me good then just so
Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh
Look with the light, I see
Top of my sight, I'm scared
Can't sleep at night
Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh

Tostitos are the shit

[Verse 1]
I'd rather die than be your slave
Slit my wrist wide and take this stage
Wipe blood out my eyes and you just lay there
You think I'm crazy, I am

[Chorus]
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high
I do
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high

[Verse 2]
I'm just a unicorn, come catch me
Strap me in chains until I bleed
You know I like it, that's why I stay here
Why should I fight it?
I won't, I won't

[Chorus]
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high

Drove in from my small town
Looking for some action
Thought I could curb the crazy
But I can't
I just crave the pain boy
I just love the thrill

This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale, this here is the epic tale

[Refrain]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Verse 1]
I hear my thoughts, I hear them creep
And into my mind, into my dreams
Voices in my head save me
Untie my hands, untie my feet
So I might fly, so I might fly
I might fly

[Chorus 1]
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind, oh
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind, broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale

[Refrain]
And I'll be by your side

Like clouds under my feet, I try not to think
Not to feel like I'm stuck in this space, I'm just me
I'm just so much more, so much more, so much
I'm so much more, I feel I'm so much more
(Feel like I'm so much more, more)

[Chorus 2]
One day I’ll live, how I lost my mind
One day if I live to tell the tale
One day if I live, how I lost my mind
One day, one day I’ll live
One day I'll live to tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day I'll live
One day I'll live, I'll tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day I'll live

Won't go no where, I'll stay right here by your side
