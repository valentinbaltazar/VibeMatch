I'm not tryna go against yuh
Actually, I'm goin' witcha

Gotta get up out of here
And yuh ain't leavin' me behind

You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, I just want outta here, yeah
Once I'm gone, ain’t no going back

[Chorus]
If you want, we can be runaways
Running from any sight of love

There ain't nothin' here for me anymore

Pray for salvation

[Hook]
Sex with me
Sex with me
Sex with me
Sex with me
Sex with me

[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me
Sex with me
Sex with me
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing

[Verse 1]
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I can not mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I’mma hit it like I’m on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
(Shots, shots, shots, shots)
Baby, I’mma pick your poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon’ need it
I’m off that la-la
I’mma get it wet like jacuzzi
You might also like[Chorus 2]
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me

[Verse 2]
You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’mma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m aloneEmbed"

Don't you stop loving me (Loving me)
Don't quit loving me (Loving me)
Just start loving me, oh (Loving me)

And, babe, I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something, babe?
And I'll run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (Feeling this way)
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (Cursing my name)

I come flutterin' in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you tried to
I come ridin' in on a pale white horse
Handin' out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you're breakin' it down for me
'Cause I can't hear you
Two times, run it on back
Will it ever make sense to me?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got to do things my own way, darlin'
Will you ever let me?
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way, darlin'
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
When I look outside my window

Ooh, darlin', would you mind givin' my reflection a break
From the pain it's feelin' now?

I'd rather be smoking weed whenever we breathe
Every time you kiss me
Don't say that you miss me
Just come get me

[Hook]
Don't know why, just know I want to
Don't know why, just know I want you

[Verse 2]
I'd rather be breaking things, cause we can't see
We're too busy kissing
Just making scenes, here come the police
They know about your history
How you live and love like ""fuck rules""?
Don't care why, just know I love you

I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white

Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)

[Bridge]
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?

Feel like a brand new person

And I know it's hard to describe

This whiskey got me feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

[Chorus]
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to sayYou might also like72Embed"

Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

[Chorus]
Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now to be close to you

[Verse 2]
Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Well just let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-oh

But was it me that changed

I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

[Verse]
I ask you, ""What's the matter?""
You say ""Oh, it's nothing at all.""
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken-hearted soul
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
(With this heart, with this heart)
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay

You're entitled to your own opinion

That's how we ball out

[Verse 2]
Valet cost a hundred bill and I still got mo' money
Gold all up in my grill, I still got mo' money
Who cares how you haters feel and I still got mo' money
Call Jay up and close a deal, I still got mo' money
My fragrance on and they love my smell, I still got mo' money
So who cares about what I spend, I still got mo' money
My pockets deep and they never end, I still got mo' money
I'm going dumb with all my friends, I still got mo' money

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-ohh-ohh, ohh, oh-oh-oh
All I see is signs, all I see is dolla' signs
Oh-ohh-ohh, ohh, oh-oh-oh
Money on my mind, money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky
[Chorus]
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-oh
What now?

He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time

I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

[Verse]
I ask you, ""What's the matter?""
You say ""Oh, it's nothing at all.""
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place

I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I’m flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer
Sex on the beach, left love speechless
They say that money talk, tell these other niggas speak up

Wherever you're headed
Can you let me know?
I don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know It'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

[Chorus]
So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me

[Verse 2]
I will write to tell you what's goin' on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day
Telling you stories about a land far away
But I know

Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul

[Chorus]
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough

[Verse 2]
Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?

I see a smile

And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I’m flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer
Sex on the beach, left love speechless

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know It'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

[Chorus]
So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me

[Verse 2]
I will write to tell you what's goin' on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day
Telling you stories about a land far away
But I know
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life (Oh)
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

[Chorus]
So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me

[Bridge]
And I'm gon' try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
I'ma try to be a big girl now
'Cause I don't wanna be the reason you don't leave
[Chorus]
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me4Embed"

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It’s the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I’ve gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[Drop: Calvin Harris]

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

[Pre-Chorus]
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Verse 2]
Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seem like more than distance between us?

Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I’m turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure, 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I'm the only one who understands
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one

Oh, make it last all night, night
Take me for a ride, ride

Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Verse 2]
Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

[Bridge]
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

Sak pasé!

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

[Chorus]
Oh, mama, mama, mama

In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd

But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
You might also like[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts

Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Verse 2]
Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Sak pasé!

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama

In front of a big ol' crowd

But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
You might also like[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts

I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
You might also like[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie2Embed"

If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, ""Close your eyes""
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

I'm like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, all I've got

Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey
[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]

Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

[Refrain: Rihanna]
All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?
[Bridge: Rihanna & will.i.am]
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)

[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you

Stupid in love
Stupid in love

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size 10 in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
Stupid in love
Stupid in love

[Verse 2]
My new nickname is ""You Idiot""
That's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me ""Let go, he is not the one.""
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist, on repeatedly trying, to tell me lies
And I just don't know why

Take a breath, take it deep
""Calm yourself,"" he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving (But I'm not leaving)
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

[Verse 2]
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, ""Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps""
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving (But I'm not leaving)
Know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart beating

Take a breath, take it deep
""Calm yourself,"" he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

[Verse 2]
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, ""Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps""
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)
Pull the trigger
And you can see my heart....
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
