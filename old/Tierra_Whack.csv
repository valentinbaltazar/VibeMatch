I know nothin' last forever but I thought we would
Now you see me doin' better, you wan' treat me good

I don't wanna take you back, you gon' say I should
Oh, you gon' say I should, I'm doin' Meagan Good
I'm doin' Meagan Good (Yeah), I'm doin' Meagan Good

[Verse 1]
I think about how we had nothin' and had dreams of gettin' money
But it seem like when I signed you got jealous, actin' funny
Woulda thought you had a monthly, boy, you took me through hell
I was faithful to you, loyal when you did time in jail
You had rap dreams too, why you ain't write in that cell?
We had the same opportunity, I just chose to prevail
You lost ya homie in '06, rest in peace to Darnell
No disrespect, it's 2020, can't continue to dwell
I was under your spell, had me sendin' Venmo and Zelle
While you out here sneakin' bitches in the nicest hotels
Even when you cheated, I felt defeated but didn't seem it
I went and cheated back, I was heated, now I'm conceited (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I know nothin' last forever but I thought we would
Now you see me doin' better, you wan' treat me good
Should did when you had the chance, yeah, the paper good
I don't wanna take you back, you gon' say I should
Oh, you gon' say I should, I'm doin' Meagan Good

I know it irritates your soul, the simple fact I don't need ya
I used to feel like I would die if we wasn't speakin'
Now I feel like I can fly and I found my beacon
My heart want love, so I gotta supply it
Your love wasn't healthy, so I'm on a new diet
I'm through cryin' with you lyin', 'cause I know better than that
Everything you did to me, ain't no editin' that
This ain't no movie, Paul Mooney, you was actin' up
Frontin' on me out in public, now I'm backin' up
I'm gone and I'm packin' up, you missed ya chance, passed it up
Hashtag mad for what? C'mon (Yeah)

You sippin' on a drink that's spiked
Enough for you to say goodnight
For the rest of your life
I know your sons won't miss you
I did a favor for them niggas
Took a loss to a winner
Rick Ross, you been dinner
You ain't fly, I make your wings stop
I'm real as fuck and your ring's not

It's survival of the fittest and I'll only take a minute
Life is short, I compare it to a midget
Shovel in the trunk of the '06 Civic

Know you hate to be ignored

Need a fine brother like my mother's son
Blah, blah, dun dun, dun-dun-dun
Had a few in the past
But them boys ain’t last
Where them boys with the cash?
Ex dead, if you ask me, uh
So, please don’t ask me

Tic Toc
Tic toc
Kicked Up

[Verse 1]
I was thirteen
I was working, tryna get my hands on the first ding-a-ling
I was lurking
We were flirting
Babyboy oum can you be my king king
Kicked up, I been watchin' you (watchin')
Tic toc, boy it's time to prove
Boy I felt so alone, I just wanna get you home
Baby don't you wanna hear me moan
I don't mean to rush it, you can be my suspect
My cover can be blown
Traveling your timeline
Following your guidelines
Time is running out
I don't want you in this drought

[Chorus]
He said I ain't waterproof
I ain't sick but I want your soup
And he said rain on me
He said Whack I ain't lyin'
Girls like you are hard to find
He said rain on me, yeah

Waiting (tic toc, stop)
Clock keeps ticking
Cause it's you that I've been missing
I been waiting (tic toc, stop)
For the right time (tic toc, stop)

[Verse 2]
What is a girl supposed to do
When her hormones keep on yelling at you
I tell you the truth
Cause still you tell me to prove the point
I think I need to find better to do
I fell in the booth
It's inevitable
You tell me to choose and then you put a tack on my shoe
Forever confused
Never turn my back on ya boo
You ride with your crew and then I ride with my dude
I never thought this day would come (yo, yo)
I remember we were young (yo, yo)
It's the vision, we must complete our mission
In this love crime baby I play the victim, I miss him
That's what I reply when they listen
Question
Why I still love you from a distance?
Difference, opposites attract when I wonder where we are
Then I wonder where you at
Where you at?
[Chorus]
He said I ain't waterproof
I ain't sick but I want your soup
And he said rain on me (rain on me)
He said Whack I ain't lyin'
Girls like you are hard to find
He said rain on me, yeah (rain on me, yeah)

[Outro]

Why would I lie and say I feel good, when I don't feel good?
All I really want is to be happy and truly feel good
I got everybody lookin' at me like, ""Why she don't feel good?""
I done seen the stars, I done seen the lights
But I can't forget that I'm still hood
Fake smiles never had me sold
Even in the summer, my heart cold
Whack, why you always be so bold?
Holidays just keep gettin' old
(Holidays just keep gettin' old)
Who can I look up to when I'm feelin' down?
Just me and not you, don't want you around
It goes happy this, it goes happy that
But somehow I can't seem to find happy Whack

I ain't been the same since you left
I hope God plan to take me next

Every birthday I'm a wreck
Therapy to get it off my chest
I'm so hurt, I'm tryna do my best
I can never seem to handle death
Hours spent whеre you last slept
Had ya last outfit preppеd
Weezy lied, she ain't even check

Woulda left with him if you could

4120390,Tierra Whack,MUMBO JUMBO (Captions),"4 ContributorsMUMBO JUMBO (Captions) Lyrics[Transcript, spelled backwards]

I am right-handed, but don't get it fucked up bitch

I can still write with my left hand too

I don't like peanut butter but I do like jelly

My turtle is dead
His name is Troy

I used to hold grudges

When I tell you that I'm a really good liar, I'm telling you the truth

I hope this film gets a million hits

Michael Jackson is not dead

When I lived with my grandmom, our toilet didn't work, we had no money to fix it, so I had to shit in a bag everyday for almost two weeks

The last song I listened to was “Crazy” by Gnarls Barkley

Buffalo wings are my favourite food

One time I forgot how old I was so I called my mom and asked her. (I was 19)
You might also likeMy boyfriends [sic] name is Mike, no I am not a dyke

I was eating a piece of chicken and the bone cracked my fucking tooth

My license plate is KLC 8495

People think that I'm an extrovert, but I'm actually introvert

I am right-handed, but don't get it fucked up bitch, I can still write with my left hand too

Yes I am religious, I believe in myself

I don't drink or smoke, but I'll probably get hit by a bus so that don't mean shit

Hi, my name is God, but everyone calls me “Whack”

Almost

I sit down in the shower and pretend to take a bath

I wish my mom was my daughter

One time I got stabbed in a shootout

I wonder if I have any fans that are midgets... [rearranged]
That would make me really happy

Dinosaurs are way cooler than dragons

I prefer to use the mens bathroom

I snore when I'm awakeEmbed",2,/songs/4120390,MUMBO JUMBO (Captions) by Tierra Whack,https://images.genius.com/ca179ee275ceafa29ba14f685f7b3948.300x300x1.png,https://images.genius.com/ca179ee275ceafa29ba14f685f7b3948.467x467x1.png,1775253,complete,/Tierra-whack-mumbo-jumbo-captions-lyrics,,https://images.genius.com/ca179ee275ceafa29ba14f685f7b3948.300x300x1.png,https://images.genius.com/ca179ee275ceafa29ba14f685f7b3948.467x467x1.png,MUMBO JUMBO (Captions),https://genius.com/Tierra-whack-mumbo-jumbo-captions-lyrics,,,,,,,

When nobody cared, you cared for me
They say you're a conspiracy
Maybe they're right (Well, maybe they're right)

How can I be lonely when I'm hangin' with my homie?
His name is Tony, and he's wearin' blue Saucony's
He's standin' right next to me, eatin' ravioli
He's my only friend because the rest of y'all are phony
My last best friend, said he wish he didn't know me
His name was Oscar and he really hurt my feelings
When I grow up I want to hang from a ceilin'
The roof is leakin', the roof is leakin' teardrops
Always available, the perfect companion
Very understandin' and swore to never abandon
He fills the gap in my teeth, when I'm sour, he sweet
The better half of me, no one else can compete (With my guy)

I might die tonight
But before I go, want to let you know
I didn't pay the light bill this month
I might die tonight
But before I go, want to let you know
I didn't pay the light bill this month

[Verse 1]
My last meal might be chicken and fries
I'm black so you should not be surprised
My jokes don't make you laugh so you cry
Boys II Men it's so hard to say-
Boys are never good, when will you return?
Dead beat daddy, throw em in an urn
Snotty nose kids, avoidin' all the germs
Everybody dies, you live and you die

[Pre-Chorus]
Learnin' how to deal with it
Said he wouldn't leave but he still did it
Auntie got the tеa, it didn't spill, did it?
Aw man, I musta forgot how to breathe
Tryna fight the feelin' likе Apollo Creed
Got a call from God, I was so relieved
Took like two Aleve, I wish you agreed

[Verse 2]
It's not my fault that this is the ending
What I had is all that I was given
In denial... you should be independent
And prepare for when I go missing
Every day I pray, every day I wake
Sleep is the cousin of death and I just need a break
Death is real, life is fake
My advice to you, make some more mistakes

Too sharp, can't poke me

Showed you to fam, introduced you to mom

Dude you’re rude, like you spit in my food
I refuse to sit and take this abuse, I was used
But I love you, I do

You know what love is about
You know I want you no doubt
Scream and we shout, dirty like flour but I’m sure to [?]

Niggas acting brand new jersey
Put a nigga in surgery, if he tryna curb me
You prolly don’t get it
That just shows you ain’t worthy, that’s unworthy...
You a die off of Power Charlie Murphy
My own blood hating on me and that shit hurts me
Raised since a have not, Lord have mercy
Tryna get a Miller like Percy
That was weak, but if it’s beef, we can meet/meat like turkey
Sis call 12 now Bobby on 12:30, laid out
You wearing coach shoes like they ain’t played out
Your man kicked you out, girl, you should’ve stayed out
What’s a challenge to a champion?
Staying my ground like I’m Anakin
You want to be a real man but you’re just a mannequin
Panicky man vanishing sweet like mandarin
Speaking in Mandarin calling for help but nobody’s answering
Blessed cause I ""Woke up this morning..."", Anthony Hamilton
Yo, they hate to hear a girl rap, quick to say that girl wack
Who the hottest in the world? It’s tha girl Whack
Your girl back, I’m a Grammy nominee
On the road to success I been tryna find the key
Millionaire in a year is what I’m tryna be
""Ay girl you so fly!"" they like ""Why Emcee?""
In a YMCA and I’m listening to me

4478898,Tierra Whack,Color Blind,"4 ContributorsColor Blind Lyrics[Intro:]
[?]

[Verse:]
Queen, the bottom looks different from the top
So you must have forgot that I was hot
I was running the block, these niggas thought I would stop
The shot was blocked, they tried to leave me dead in the box
But I forgot to ride them here
Motherfucker and I’m ready for supper
I’m coming with thunder from under the covers
You better run with your mother
Cause I work better like bread with the butter
You probably find you brother dead in the summer
Don’t match the price for sacrifice, it’s best advice
My cousin told me don’t pass the mic
Had an eee, then I trapped the mice
Niggas acting like they can’t be light
Skinned, too dark so there can’t be light
I can’t be white, whatever
[?]
Heard you were legally blind
You was a god, devil’s alive
There is no music we vibe
We all made up of skeleton inside
So run and hide, go run and hide
Come on baby, come on baby let’s vibe
[?]
Open your eyes
Nothing to fear, the queen is here
Nothing is fear, the queen

Everybody's always askin'
How'd you get on We Run the Streets?
Think its 'bout time I tell y'all a little story (Little story)
Yo, yo

[Verse]
Look, I came home from school
I was on my way to sleep
Even kicked off my sneaks and put some Nas on repeat
Got a knock on my door, little sister yellin ""Dizzle come on!""
I replied in the crack of a yawn
Then my mom stomped upstairs, looking all mean
She said if you wanna stay home, you gon have to clean
The bathroom, the dishes, and mop the whole kitchen
Said mom where we goin' to see how grandma is living?
I was too tired, and I ain't care to hear it
But my grandmas gettin' older and her death a really fear it
This whole time I was thinkin' too deep
I had this gut feelin' keep tellin' me to hop in the jeep (Beep beep)
I hear my mom honking the horn so I threw on some clothes and took off my uniform
I was chillin' in the car, push back my seat and all
Turn the radio up and started bobbin' my skull
All in the days, I was staring out the window
Thinkin' to myself like ""When I'm gonna win yo?""
Rapping for a while but I just can't seem to make it
Second guessin' myself, I thought my skills had been wasted
But that wasn't the deal, that day I was depressed
I failed my Chemistry test, I'm talkin' straight F
Ridin through the city, no Philly to be specific
Rode past 18th & Oxford and dudes were spittin'
My mom said ""Go rap, go on, just do it""
This could be your big break and it seemed like she knew it
Mother knows best so you know I got to it
I hopped out the ride and I was ready to influence
I did it, I killed it, but I was pretty nervous
Got a call that night and it was, it was pretty urgent
A guy named Ant, CEO We Run the Streets
He had filmed famous casts, like Cassidy and even me
I was shocked when he said he had posted up my video
Crazy feedback, I was the talk of the city yo!
One night, six thousand views, you know how I do
First lady, We Run the Streets, now guess who I be
D-I double Z L-E

I wanna get out now
We should go out now
Because I'm sick of being stuck in the house
I wanna go out now
I wanna get out now
We should go out now

Now is the time I been losing my mind
I wanna see what's going on outside
I need some love and my hair done
I need some love, could you spare some
I don't wanna be trapped inside anymore
What is there to do when you're just so freakin' bored
So won't you let me out this hellhole
Inside of here I hear an echo
Seems like I may never be free
I wish you were with me

I wanna get some fresh air
Whack shop clothes, someone gotta use there
Do you feel me out there?
Can you hear me out there?
