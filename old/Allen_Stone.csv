Every day the deficit grows
You spend more than you own
Papa always said to me
""Keep a close eye on your authority""

[Chorus]
'Cause you say that you cared
And I was unaware
You say that you cared
And I was unaware

[Hook]
All you do is push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther

[Verse 2]
Every day taxes increase
So is this our land or is this our lease?
Papa says ""Son, it's the land of the free""
As he broke his back trying to make ends meet

I've got a brown eyed lover

I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't wanna keep her waiting, waiting)
She's got me upside tongue-tied
Twisted all around
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't wanna keep her waiting, waiting)

[Verse 1]
Well, I don't know
I can't tell
Will this last
Or just come and go?
It came so fast
And my feet feel cold
But my mind is for sure
And my heart remains
Oh, she's got everything you want
Wardrobe bought at the thrift shop
And all my friends adore her
She reminds me of my mother
She wonders how my day went
And don't care about my paychecks

Oh, let me think
What if she finds a man
Who's got so much more time
For her than me on his hands?
That don't make sense
Why would she wait so long
Just to run away?

And I can still afford her
She wishes I'd stop worrying
About where my next paycheck is

But I will wipe your tears (but for you, stop it rain)

And just make it disappear (just for you)

Oh, it doesn't seem right
That I - I was born white
And my parents don't fight
Told me they love me each night
I don't lose sleep for kids sewing my sheets
Or the ones stitching my sneaks
As long as I can buy 'em both cheap

American privilege is blurring my vision
Inherited sickness

[Verse 2]
Everyday I, piss money away, I'm a material slave
Just trynna polish this ball and this chain
Cause I don't think twice, just keep it out of my sight
Bitch don't kill my vibe

You may see the stars glowing

Are they really shining
Or just burning in the sky?
Well, maybe they're a little bit of both at the same time, ha

And felt so good it hurt?
But then they went running
When you dug up all their dirt
Was it only lust
Or is love also a curse?
Maybe they're a little bit of both in reverse

How come some days you're living
And other days it's dеath?
How come everything that's givеn

How you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But...felt so lonely in your company...
That was love and it's an ache I still remember...

Resignation to the end, always the end (Well-well) ...
When we found that we could not make sense
You said that we would still be friends
I'll admit that I was glad when it was over... (Huh!)

You didn't have to cut me off
Make-out like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love

I know exactly where we're headed
Science won't give God any credit
And the church says
""As long the prophet said it
It's good enough for the church to be fed it""

We disagree from Genesis to Revelations
We need to get to the core of the situation
And stop bitchin' 'bout same-sex relations

And the chapel says it's non-profit, yeah
'cept if the prophet wants a Benz, he goes and cops it
And growing up, wealth was never topic
My daddy never had bread up in his pocket
And my tax dollars only teach abstinence
'cept half the girls I grew up with got pregnant
Instead of scholarships, they got carriages
Instead of chasing their dreams, they're chasing marriages

[Verse 3]
And Martin Luther King had a vision
So this must be a blind generation
And it seems that we've become a nation
Manipulated by the congregation
And we will never find racial unity
Unless we find equal opportunity
Well, I will never rest for immunity
Cause I was born and raised in a Caucasian community
The less-fortunate are run
By their desires for these poisons

Love is like gravity
It pulls me down equally
And draws me back every time
This love is a heavy kind
That love is my enemy
I keep it close, close to me
And I forget that the pain it caused
It's better to have loved than lost it

This love has no alibi
Still, it feeds my appetite

Nonetheless, I believe
That this will be the death of me

[Verse 1]
Hey!
Let me take a second
First of everybody lower your weapons
There's a million different ways to spin a message
So I gotta box this up and express it
There's so much static in the universe
My '98 Saturn seems stuck in reverse
But the majority are troubles that I notice
Are always magnified by the way ya focus

I'm super unqualified to educate

Or you can wrap your worries underneath your armpits
'Cause there's degrees to my spiritual secret

Tossed in the wind to nourish our needs

Like the wind whistling its song
It's extraordinary
But tell me what's normal that's still captivating?

So let the wind guide you like the tides of the Atlantic
'cause in the end, life don't go just like we planned it
I know it seems like we'll come up empty-handed
But look at this harvest we've already planted

How life's wind still blows in this rain
But girl, I know it's true

Oh, please just swear you'll be right there

You know the sun is peeking over the clouds, and the music's tight
Drummer playing kick-drum proud as the bass takes flight

Just celebrate tonight
There's reason to feel right

Steady, child, don't get lost in your worried mind
Doesn't matter what it costs, matters what you find
Forget all of the pressure from all your deadlines

Multiplied by the girl you are
Divided by the man I can be
Equals perfect symmetry
The circumference of your waist
Is just a fraction of your grace
Your anatomy is laced with the cosmic energy of space

So here is my intention
I've got to have it
All your dimensions
'Cause I want that symmetrical love
That symmetrical love
The symmetrical love
That symmetrical love
Love, love, love, love

Is sending lightning bolts down mine
When those molecules combine
It's astronomically divine
The median of you and I
Is a number I cannot define

'cause I got a hole deep down in my soul
And I don't wanna let nobody know
So I'll just bury myself deep inside
'til I can't breathe anymore

I can't decide
If I wanna live or if I wanna die
Will this pain ever subside
Or is this the last night of my life?

And this can't be true
Nobody's ever felt like I do
And I'm so confused
Have I already tied my noose?

Politicians manipulate minds
And public opinion is either left or it's right, no, no, no
No progression, we just argue and fight
For centuries, we've been dig and devise

And every time I open my eyes
It seems my nightmare's come back to life
I'm singing, well, if you saw what I have seen
You would get lost in between
What is real and what's just a dream
I'm singin', well, if you saw what I have seen

The heart of man is just blackened with greed
Wanting more than he will ever need
Cancerous from the root to the seed
Gain a fortune, but your soul is the feed

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin’ home to a place he’d never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key to every door

[Verse 2]
When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away
On the road and hangin’ by a song
But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care
It keeps changin’ fast and it don’t last for long

[Chorus 1]
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado

[Verse 3]
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

[Verse 4]
Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply

[Verse 5]
And now his life is full of wonder, but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

[Chorus 3]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly

Or just come and go?

And my feet feel cold
But my mind is for sure
And my heart remains

And all my friends adore her

Never wake before noon
When the sun, it rises
Oh, it always rises soon
'Cause I spend my nights howlin' at the moon, yeah

I never get sleep, sleep, sleep
No, I just reach, rea-, reach
I can feel it on the ends of my fingers
And taste it on the tips of my teeth
So you see why I never get sleep

(I can't get no sleep
Don't know why
I can't get no sleep
Don't know why
I can't get no sleep
Don't know why,)

Spend my night shootin' at the stars, yeah
Tryin' to change the world with this guitar
And I know it's a long shot, but it's working out so far
So I spend my nights shootin' at the stars, hey

I never get sleep, sleep, sleep
No, I just reach, rea-, reach
I can feel it on the ends of my fingers
And taste it on the tips of my teeth
So you see why I never get sleep

(Drink whiskey)
It makes my throat too dry
(Smoke weed)
It makes my eyes all red
(Take a pill, Al)
What, and end up dead?

I can feel it on the ends of my fingers

You won't find it in your status line

Whose mountain are you trying to move?
