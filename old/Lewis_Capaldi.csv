I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
You might also like[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

[Chorus]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

Counting days, counting days

And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind

Never spent so long on a losing battle
But lately, giving up don't seem to matter

Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love

No regrets is what we said

Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able

Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

While I'm still out here in the rain

And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied

Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, ""Without you, everything's wrong""
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best

It ain't no wonder why we lose control
When we're always a heart attack away from falling in love
Well, I know that we've been hardly holding on
To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far
Running near on empty
I wish somebody would've told me

[Chorus]
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me
Girl, you make my heart break more every day
But don't fade away

[Verse 2]
And when I'm just about to pass the point of it all
You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs
And now it's so hard to breathe
I wish somebody would've told me

[Chorus]
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray

I've said a thousand things before
I've fallen in and out of love
I couldn't walk but tried to run
At night, the weight of expectation seems to keep me up
A thousand times, I said too much
Always second-guess before I jump
I gave my all, but not enough
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough

[Pre-Chorus]
How come I'm the only one who ever seems to get in my way?
Lately, I've been fucking up a good thing any chance I can get

[Chorus]
Somebody to lean on, somebody to hold
It's just another to lead, though, before I let go
And I ain't trying to be lonely, solely
But everything I touch turns to stone
Maybe I'm better off on my own

I've heard some other voices in my head

I bring her coffee in the mornin'
She brings me inner peace
I take her out to fancy restaurants
She takes the sadness out of me
I make her cards on her birthday
She makes me a better man
I take her water when she's thirsty
She takes me as I am

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when her mind wanders
And she loves it when I stay at home
I know when she's lost
And she knows when I feel alone

[Chorus]
From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everything is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everything is pointless without you

[Verse 2]
I light the fire when it's cold out
And she lights up the room
I hope that she'll love me forever
She hopes I'll be back soon
I take her out to the movies
She takes away my pain
She is the start of everything
And I'll be there 'til the end

To help you make it through the darker days
For now, I wait by the hour

And I'd hate to think you're better off without me
I know we tried to hold on, but where do you go
When love, it just ain't enough?
Now does it kill you when you think about me?
Are you as close to giving up as I've been?
I know we kept losing touch, got lost in the rush
I pray you don't hurt too much

Will you forgive me if I'm comin' off a little bit obtuse?
Well, it's been a minute now since I have had to tell the truth
I know I can
I won't

[Verse 2]
Suppose I thought that, by this moment, I would have it figured out
But, instead, I tend to spend my days consumed by seeds of doubt
I know I can
I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, darlin', it goes on and on and on
Always, forever, 'til I'm barely holdin' on
End of my tether and I know it won't be long
It won't be long 'til it's gone

[Chorus]
So here's to my beautiful life
That seems to leave me so unsatisfied
No sense of self, but self-obsessed
I'm always trapped inside my fuckin' head

[Post-Chorus]
On and on and on, on and on and on
On and on and on, on and on and on
Said, ""Thought I'd be happier somehow

I don't know how we got to where we are
So far removed, I don't know where to start
'Cause I've been away for far too long
But I implore you, please hold on
I beg you, please hold on

And it's killing me to hang on
And hope it's enough

So, I was just wondering
Could you tell me, is it all a waste of time?
Are you leaving my love behind?
Baby, say the word and let me know
You gotta give me something
I swear that I won't try to change your mind
If you're leaving my love behind
Baby, say the word and let me go

And it's got me thinking that lately something's changed

Every little part of me is holding on to every little piece of you
Is holding on to every drop of blood you drew
Is holding onto you
And every waking hour I spend
Holding out for reasons not to go to bed
I'm holding out for someone else to hold instead
If every hope of you is dead

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every night since you cut and run
I feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking
With every step that you're taking

[Chorus]
'Cause you've been running circles 'round
My mind, turning me inside out
And I fell for you but hit the ground
'Cause the only love I've known has let me
Down and I need lifting up
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough
And I'm praying I can pray enough
So waking up without you ain’t so tough

Find it hard to find my feet
When I keep on stumbling over you and me
But I keep on trying 'cause I know I need

Where'd you get to? Where'd you go?
I've been so lost since you left
Wish you kept leading me on
Tried to reach ya, tried to call
I bang my head against your door
But there ain't nobody home

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want to stay lost awhile
I'll rearrange the road I take
And meet you out in the wild
And if you want, we can wait behind
We can find a place to hide
Maybe I could change your mind

[Chorus]
So, I'm holding out for something more
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again
Let it roll, let it roll, let me hold your heart of stone

[Verse 2]
If you think you might feel the same
I'll be right here where we left off
Same old story, same old place
I won't wander, I won't let go
'Cause there's more life in my bones
Than you give me credit for
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want to stay lost awhile
I'll rearrange the road I take
And meet you out in the wild
And if you want, we can wait behind

So, I'm holding out for something more
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again

[Bridge]
You don't need to lose control, I just wanna let you know
I'm holding on to make you whole, don't let go, don't let go
You don't need to lose control, I just wanna let you know
I'm holding on to make you whole, don't let go, don't let go
You don't need to lose control, I just wanna let you know
I'm holding on to make you whole, don't let go, don't let go

You got your demons, spent seasons on the dark side of the moon
Don't try denying 'cause you know that I've been there too
Right now, I know how it feels like the world's gonna end
But I'll get you through, if it's the last thing I do

Take all the pain that you're going through
I'll bring you heaven if that's what you need
'Cause you've always loved the hell out of me

You brought resoundin' techniques for my groundin' when I
Had lost it a little too far from the middle to find
Some solace from all this exhaustion and monsters of mine
So, you better know that I'll bring you home

But I've been missing something

Oh, I'm tryna find any truth in between the lies
Am I wasting my time?

But it gets in my bones all the same, ooh-ooh

Well, maybe I'm a fool
For falling in love with you
When I had nothing left to lose
And nothing more I could give
Went down with your sinking ship
Now I don't think I'll make it through
Through

Now it's only the beat of my heart
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya

The darkest sense I get when I'm in the open
When the ground beneath my feet starts falling away
The cold cold press I find when I'm sick and soulless
Or the warmth I feel at the end of a damp cigarette

That keeps me from drowning
Something in the tide
That pulls me away

That keeps me from drowning

Afraid to run my mouth in case my words escape me
Cautious when I speak scared of what I might say
Hang me out to dry when the wars are all over

Is it lost on me when I don't have that much to say

Said, ""My dear, you're not the only one""
Spent the night there at my place
That night became a hundred days
And I shared all my deepest secrets with you
Soon enough, well, I found out you're something I can't live without
And, every time I close my eyes, I miss you

You were the raging storm that wrecked
A beautiful mind I can't forget
Knew from the moment that we met I'd take you home
But, now that the future's so unclear
Have all of your feelings disappeared?
'Cause I'm in no kind of frame of mind to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Hope, have you some that I can borrow?
'Cause I've been so low
And the weight of all the world's a heavy load
Keep me going till tomorrow
'Cause I just don't know if I can face another day alone

[Chorus]
Well, my lungs don't breathe
And my heart don't beat
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
No, I just don't want any kind of life without you, dear

[Verse 2]
Are there any words that I could say?
I'm feeling our moment fade away
In a matter of hours, we'll be drowning in the waves
And, all of the memories that we shaped
We're leaving behind, here in my wake

Waking up too early, static on the TV
Dressed in all the clothes I had on
When yesterday decided I didn't need to fight with
The hours and the seconds no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Doing all the things that I'm supposed to
Working every day the way that most do
Smiling while I'm hiding what I'm going through
But you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
That, if I'm being honest
I couldn't tell you this is all I wanted
I struggle sleeping 'cause the house feels haunted
Filled with the shadows of regret and the things I should've said
To the ones I laid to rest, and, lately
I'm terrified that all my youth is fading
Man, growing old is so excruciating
Is there a cure for minds unwell? 'Cause my head's a living hell
If I'm honest with myself

[Verse 2]
Stumble as I'm leaving, one foot takes the lead, and
Second seems to struggle to find
A solitary reason to continue seeking
Any use in walking this line

Man, growing old is so excruciating
Is there a cure for minds unwell? 'Cause my head's a living hell
If I'm honest with myself

[Bridge]
So, how am I supposed to see an end
To my all-consuming, constant fear and dread
When I can't even seem to make it out of bed?

[Chorus]
Yeah, if I'm being honest
I couldn't tell you this is all I wanted
I struggle sleeping 'cause the house feels haunted
Filled with the shadows of regret and the things I should've said

You said, ""Who are we fooling?""

On all that I am and all that I'm not

From all that we are and will never be

And I'm hanging my head 'cause I'm tryna forget

All of those years that I wasted for lovе
And here it is, forevеrmore

If all mistakes were made in stone
I'd build a wall so tall you'd see for miles
And every man and child would come to see
Stand and laugh at me
Like you would not believe, and I can't blame 'em
It's kind of funny when you start to

Who breaks his heart as often as the moon
Shows its face to you
And I regret to say, politely, I'm the guy who'll more than likely lose
Like I always do

So, tell me, are you running scared
'Cause you know that I'm beyond repair?
Well, baby, I'm a master of the ancient art of always fucking up

'Cause I wrote the book, the study of the ancient art of always fucking up

[Verse 2]
May I have your attention please?

The absolutely mind-inflaming show
About a boy who sold his soul
For a shot at love and gold

Been trapped in my ways

Broken by desire to be heavenly sent
Divinely uninspired to a hellish extent
When my heart stops beating
Will it all be in vain?
It burns a little faith every time it'll fall
Looking for reconciliation with the years that I've lost
When my heart stops beating, will I still feel the same?

[Chorus]
I've been falling for miles down for a while
And back again
It's only calm for a while now in the eye of the hurricane
I only wanna feel safe
Can't dig my heels in the ground
I only wanna be free
And make my family proud
And I hope I figure it out

[Verse 2]
Getting used to prying eyes to my faith I resign
Guess it's the classic roll of pay for trying to step out of line
If it all starts crumbling, well the blame is all mine

I've been falling for miles down for a while
And back again
It's only calm for a while now in the eye of the hurricane

Can't dig my heels in the ground

Don't wanna make no mistake

Cut my teeth on memories from playgrounds to the bars
There's bigger boys with broken hearts who throw their weight around
But settle down, and be here now, just watch the world revolve
Don't it feel so good to be so small?

[Verse 2]
Cast my mind behind and think of girls I used to know
Who've all moved on to better things and found the ones they love
But it don't breed animosity, I'm not perturbed at all
Oh, man, it feels so good to feel so small

[Chorus]
Well, it's sad but sometimes it's true
That your friends become the people you knew
Once upon a time, that you left behind
Old navy blue

[Verse 3]
No matter though, how good things go, they've always got to end
I've said goodbye to family from the side of their sick beds
So, to all the ones I'll always love but faded out of view
Until we meet again, this one's for you

Well, it's sad but sometimes it's true
That your friends become the people you knew
Once upon a time, that you left behind

Ain't it sad? The things that you'll miss
When you're gone and the world, it still spins
'Cause you're not here to stay, so, just be here today
Old navy blue
But, after all this time, you're still a friend of mine

[Verse 1]
Heard that you're moving on and I shoulda guessed
What else was I to expect? It’s probably for the best
'Cause you need somebody like me, like a gun to the head
And I know it's been months since then, but it doesn’t hurt any less

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, darling, that I left you, stranded
Broken, damaged
But, now that you're gone

[Chorus]
I wanna turn back time, tell you I'm wrong
Don't wanna waste my nights, singing sad songs
I'll spend a lifetime wishing I'd stayed
But it's a little too late to tell you that, babe
How could I let you fall through my hands?
I should've held you when I had thе chance
I’ll spend a lifetimе wishing I’d stayed
But it's a little too late to tell you that, babe

I’m here, picking up pieces of what could've been

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Don't get lonely now
I'm drowning my head till I figure it out
And you're not hard to find
You're on every face, between every line

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I fell short
Almost had it all
Just shy, never gonna give it up
We were so close
The closest I've been
When you're looking for love
Just shy, no it's never gonna be enough

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll be
All I'll ever be
'Cause I don't feel half as whole without you holding on to me
Too little, too late
Too little, too long
I don't wanna face the thought of letting go
When holding on is all I've ever known

I'm going under and this time I fear there’s no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you’re not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
(Someone you loved, someone you loved, someone you loved)
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
(Someone you loved)

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound ’til I come back around

And you’re not here

I heard that you settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I couldn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Well am I burning in the back of your mind
'Cause girl I can't get you out of mine
And I heard you say that you'd come of age
But girl you don't look any older to me

[Pre-Chorus]
And what becomes of you
When the fat lady sings her last tune?
And what becomes of you?
Can you say it's true that the life you lived
Was a a life meant to be lived by you?

[Chorus]
When you're holding on by a pin or a thread
Will you think of me when you take your last breath?
When you're crying out for a little more time
Will I still be burning there
In the back of your mind?

But I think I more or less did the same

While staring at the bedroom door
Your shoulder's colder lately
Than any love I've felt before

And all the scars I can't forget

Hope you'll be holding onto my last breath
The truth's in everything we never said
We love in infrared

Can't ignore
All the shadows knocking down our door
But If we learn to love our darkness
They won't hold us like they did before

When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm high, I don't come down
And I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I could leave you just this fast

[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
See, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

[Chorus]
See I got issues
You got 'em too
So give 'em all to me
And I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory
Of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love
It takes to solve 'em

See, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect
Poorly wired circuit
You got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in

[Pre-Chorus]
And you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
See, you don't judge me
'Cause you see it from the same point of view

[Chorus]
Well, I got issues
You got 'em too
So give 'em all to me
And I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory
Of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love
It takes to solve 'em

See, I got issues

I got issues, you got 'em too
I got issues, you got 'em too
I got issues and you got 'em too
I got issues, you got 'em too

[Chorus]
See, I got issues
You got 'em too
So give 'em all to me

Wise men say only fools rush in
But  I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you?

[Verse 2 - Mamma Mia]
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

[Pre-Chorus - Mamma Mia]
Just one look & I can hear a bell ring
One more look & I forget everything, whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus - Mamma Mia]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist ya?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I missed ya?
Yes, I've been broken hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?

You know that I'm not that strong

[Pre-Chorus - Mamma Mia]

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taken
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

So tell me, can you turn around?
I need someone to tear me down
Tell me, can you turn around?

Every little part of me is holding on to every little piece of you
Is holding on to every drop of blood you drew
Is holding onto you
And every waking hour I spend
Holding out for reasons not to go to bed
I'm holding out for someone else to hold instead
If every hope of you is dead

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every night since you cut and run
I feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking
With every step that you're taking

[Chorus]
'Cause you've been running circles 'round
My mind, turning me inside out
And I fell for you but hit the ground
'Cause the only love I've known has let me
Down and I need lifting up
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough
And I'm praying I can pray enough
So waking up without you ain’t so tough

I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
""You'll never reach it""
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
But my faith is fading

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
It's always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing
These chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
I won't be breaking

But these are the moments that

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
And today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
But today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
But today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
You might also like[Chorus]
I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Bridge]
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe, ooh-ooh
Yeah, sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe, yeah

[Chorus]
I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Verse 2]
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine, sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever

Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?

Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms

I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
It went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002
We were only 11
Acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, ""Love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taken
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind

'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you

Sunny seas, warmer skies
Looking like a holiday of a lifetime
Wanna piece of Mum and me
Skipping stones looking out at the sea
I can't wait to get back home
See my cockapoo, I know he's all alone
He's only nine months old
I'm sure he's missed me

[Verse 2]
I get back, looking tired
It's midnight out by the morning wine
I need a little concentrate
I need to lie down, get my head straight
I can't believe I found it home
I miss my cockapoo so much, I need his love
Rory, son, how you been?
Close your eye, let's go to sleep
E-e-e-e

[Verse 3]
But when I woke up, I couldn't smell a thing
It was a scentless thing I smelled
Down the stairs, I need it a little bit, cup of tea
And when I woke up, the sound of Rory retching woke me up
Got me feeling low
Rory, what have you done now?
He'd been sick, it's bad!
Censored Swear Ah, sorry
Rory, I love you
But sometimes you make me weak
Why did you have to spew?
Oh man, I miss the Maldives; I said
""Rory, son, you really test my patience
Now I feel I got a little rest
Rory, son, I took it all""

Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able

Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

Every little part of me is holding on to every little piece of you
Is holding on to every drop of blood you drew
Is holding onto you
And every waking hour I spend
Holding out for reasons not to go to bed
I'm holding out for someone else to hold instead
If every hope of you is dead

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every night since you cut and run
I feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking
With every step that you're taking

[Chorus]
'Cause you've been running circles 'round
My mind, turning me inside out
And I fell for you but hit the ground
'Cause the only love I've known has let me
Down and I need lifting up
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough
And I'm praying I can pray enough

With time no i didn't think it would be fine, no
The music was playing, but we couldn't face it. It's trying to pretend nothing's wrong
And you never told me, you were burning slowley, but you know I knew all along

So I never took the time to say
Everything you ment to me
I just can't belive that you're not here
And everything i showеd of us
Now I never get thе chance
I just can't belive that you're not here
'Cause I had the best when I had you
And now that you're gone, all that I do

Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone
'Cause, the longer you convince me to stay
Our salvation's slipping further away
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya

Forget everything we've come to expect
It only serves to further fuck with our heads
And I don't wanna pretend
This will all be alright in the end, ooh-ooh

So maybe, now, instead of balancing on the edge
We could put this to bed for good
Can call it quits or risk sinking with this broken ship
But I don't think we'd make it through
Through

That reminds me not to stare at the sparks

Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya

[Bridge]
I wish I could stay
I wish I could lie
Do whatever it takes to get you through the night
I can't be the one
I can't take the fall
Can't go up in the flames to keep your body warm
[Chorus]
Now it's only the beat of my heart
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going undеr, and this time, I fear therе's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall

Out of focus, didn't take a second to notice
Now we're separated by oceans, vast
Couldn't make this last

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart unsteady
Then it breaks, so I'm prayin' that you're feelin' the same

[Chorus]
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryin' to find
Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?

[Verse 2]
All the streetlights illuminate what home used to feel like
And when I get to thinkin', can't sleep at night
No, I don't feel right

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart unsteady
Then it breaks, so I'm prayin' that you're feelin' the same

Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart

Oh, and you know I would if I could
Maybe I spend more time in Hollywood than I should
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?

[Bridge]
If you can hear me, does it really have to end?
I feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up, just tell me where and when
We'll go back to the start again
If you can hear me, does it really have to end?
I feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up, just tell me where and when
We'll go back to the start again

You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryin' to find

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

'Causе every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you

Long hours and a few dyin' flowers
But you never seem to stick around
How could you let somethin' so good
Go to waste and bleed the colours out?

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know what you got till it's gone
Know when it's right till it's wrong
In search of perfect when you had it with you all along
You broke her heart down with ease
Now I'm pickin' up every piece
You must be so hard to please

[Chorus]
I wish I could say
""Thank you for all the mistakes
Thank you for all of the pain""
I guess somebody else's loss is another's gain
I'm sayin' thank you to the one who let her get away
Away

[Verse 2]
She gave you love, but it wasn't еnough
You had your mind set out on other things
Can't sleep at night, now you're payin' thе price

7438096,Lewis Capaldi,Before You Go (Live From Wembley),"1 ContributorBefore You Go (Live From Wembley) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather

It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Verse 2]
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there

I've said a thousand things before
I've fallen in and out of love
I couldn't walk but tried to run
At night, the weight of expectation seems to keep me up
A thousand times, I said too much
Always second-guess before I jump
I gave my all, but not enough
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough

How come I'm the only one who ever seems to get in my way?
Lately, I've been fucking up a good thing any chance I can get

And I ain't trying to bе lonely, solely
But evеrything I touch turns to stone
Maybe I'm better off on my own

And when I get to thinkin', can't sleep at night
No, I don't feel right

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart unsteady
Then it breaks, so I'm prayin' that you're feelin' the same
You might also like[Chorus]
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryin' to find
Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?
Oh, and you know I would if I could
Maybe I spend more time in Hollywood than I should
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?

[Bridge]
If you can hear me, does it really have to end?
I feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up, just tell me where and when
We'll go back to the start again
If you can hear me, does it really have to end?
I feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up, just tell me where and when
We'll go back to the start again

[Chorus]
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryin' to find
(If you can hear me, does it really have to end?)
Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
(I feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead)
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
(If we can pick it up, just tell me where and when)
Do you ever feel like goin' back?
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryin' to find
Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?
Oh, and you know I would if I could
Maybe I spend more time in Hollywood than I should
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?Embed",0,/songs/7438094,Hollywood (Live From Wembley) by Lewis Capaldi,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.1000x1000x1.jpg,10028057,complete,/Lewis-capaldi-hollywood-live-from-wembley-lyrics,,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.1000x1000x1.jpg,Hollywood (Live From Wembley),https://genius.com/Lewis-capaldi-hollywood-live-from-wembley-lyrics,/albums/842826,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.1000x1000x1.jpg,Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent: Finale by Lewis Capaldi,842826.0,Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent: Finale,"December 4, 2020",https://genius.com/albums/Lewis-capaldi/Divinely-uninspired-to-a-hellish-extent-finale
7438092,Lewis Capaldi,Headspace (Live From Wembley),"1 ContributorHeadspace (Live From Wembley) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Salt of the earth, my friend
It's all that we are in the end
Well, you trapped down all the lines you drew
And I can take the hit but I'm sorry, I don't want the bruise
Your voice gets a little loud
When there's nothing to talk about, you shout, dear

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll find my lights fading out
More and more by the hour
It gets dark in here

[Chorus]
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me

[Verse 2]
Dust to dust, my friend
Wеll, you're only blood and bones
And I know your heart's at war with your hеad
I am sure it hurt to see
You're more than I'll ever have
And more than I'll ever be
I know it's a little late
My timing was never great
But I'm calling, dear
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanted to let you know
That I won't bother you anymore
I'll be gone this time next year

[Chorus]
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
I never thought that a lie could sound so sweet
Until you opened your mouth
And you said you loved meEmbed",0,/songs/7438092,Headspace (Live From Wembley) by Lewis Capaldi,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.1000x1000x1.jpg,10028057,complete,/Lewis-capaldi-headspace-live-from-wembley-lyrics,,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.1000x1000x1.jpg,Headspace (Live From Wembley),https://genius.com/Lewis-capaldi-headspace-live-from-wembley-lyrics,/albums/842826,https://images.genius.com/29762b0fc004d34060251d0eae61b820.1000x1000x1.jpg,Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent: Finale by Lewis Capaldi,842826.0,Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent: Finale,"December 4, 2020",https://genius.com/albums/Lewis-capaldi/Divinely-uninspired-to-a-hellish-extent-finale
