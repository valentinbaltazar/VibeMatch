[Chorus]
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me
(One, two, three, and)

[Verse 1]
Think I'm dreaming
This isn't real
'Cause you leave in a month
And I'm fiending for something to feel
When you hold me
Know you know me down to my core
This is the calm before the storm
You diverted attention away when I mentioned
That someone else gon' need you more

[Chorus]
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me, oh, oh
(Who are you?)

[Verse 2]
And I fell apart in that bed
What we built isn't me
Won't put it back together again
(He didn't answer me)
I can't take back what I said
I just look through those messages I left on read
Ooh, and I took you to Rosier
'Cause I thought we could cope
We got out on the ocean, I fell out my boat
And you calmed me back down
And you gave me some hope
And I tossed that away for a seratone
You might also like[Chorus]
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me, oh, oh

[Bridge]
(No commitments, no commitments) No commitments
(No commitments, no commitments) No commitments
(No commitments) No commitments (No commitments), no
No commitments (No commitments)
No commitments (No commitments)
No commitments (No commitments)
No commitments, no commitments
I'm going to Hell, you're going to Heaven
It doesn't negate our holy connection
And next time I fly too close to the sun
I'm not gonna run, this shit was for fun

[Part II: punk2]

[Verse]
(Fifty, fifty, fifty)
I left home now I'm fucked up
Realized how much I loved you
Whole goddamn life, been a suck-up
Now I'm just tryna get my luck up
All the pain went when you kissed me
We were ten toes up, now I'm six feet down
Moved on, you don't need me now
Now I gotta figure me out
Ah (Brakence)
No, I gotta figure me out, oh-oh, yeah, uh
Bitch, I'm up next
Fuckboy ain't a threat
Put a price on my head
Won't sell my soul for a check
That's on God, that's on sound
You won't ever see me 'round
I'll be cookin' up some shit that'll probably get me out this town

Fuckboy tryna play my homie
But 2020, I'ma take time on me
Out the window where my mainline goes
This is sacrilegious how I'm gon' fade off IG (brakence)

[Verse 1]
Heartache comes in many forms
One day opens any door but
I've never seen this distant
What success? My eyes are on a screen
If you're hurting, call my line
And if you're doin' good, it's not like I don't care
I wanna see the world
This shit ain't the same if I can't breathe your air

[Chorus]
Fuckboy tryna play my homie
But 2020, I'ma take time on me
Out the window where my mainline goes
This is sacrilegious how I'm gon' fade off IG (I can do everything)

[Post-Chorus]
Hope you find someone who can be invested
I'm not over you, that's not my objective
So obsessed with my mistakes, I gotta accept them
So I'm not gonna listen to him

He always wants a little more
Lost in his fake love and subliminals
Won't stay true if it's difficult
A lie is a lie
Won't hide this shit to waste your time
And that's just bein' honest
Shouldn't fall in love and I shouldn't go to college
Gotta fight off all the pain he made in August
I'm not who you think I am

Fuckboy tryna play my homie
But 2020, I'ma take time on me
Out the window where my mainline goes
This is sacrilegion how I'm gon' fade on IG

You should up your standards for what I can be impressed with
Out your metric
I'm alive and I need help
Hit concrete bottom
You could say I learned my lesson

I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack (I'm using my imagination)

[Chorus]
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me bugging hеr last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smartеr to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask—

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm laced with poison, I can't escape the rush
This ain't love, boy, you're just a pick-me-up
And the gaze Medusa, locks rattlesnakes, debuffed
No need to purchase my soul, girl, I'll just give it up
I'm like ""God damn,"" she slid in, now we're breaking the ice
The concoction just hit me, it's dilating my eyes
Fuck my options, she pulled me in, she didn't even try
I was hypnotized soon as her lips met mine, I can't forget

My corpse is spillin' blood in the backseat
She's undercover, got a Trojan to crash me
Leave a scar on my soul, seein' stars in the road
I take it better when she don't even ask me

[Verse 2]
She got this on repeat
I'm obsessive as her, she obsessive as me (Yeah)
Laments turn me to stone, and her curves got me weak
She wan' get us alone, I can tell she a freak
It be like, oh no, she invited me to a pity party
But go home and hope you ain't leavin' with nobody
But fate sewn, she'll take me back to her place
Can't say this shit to her face or make up my mind, I can't forget
[Refrain]
A hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack
The things I do to see you smile
[Verse 3]
Yeah, I know I made my art entertainment
Carbon to coal, now my card can't decline and it costs my control
I'll let God integrate, but until then I gotta give in to you, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week

Don't even ask (Fall deep)
Then we vaporized 'til our fates aligned
I think we frayed the twine
Tethering space and time, I can't forget

[Interlude]
Into this trance
Your mind is programmed to drift on these words
Use my voice in your head as a thread to your heart
All that pain you're carrying, all that regret (She knows)
I can remove it, all you have to do is let me (She grows, she grows)

[Outro]
She grows through my throat and my chest
My tears were glowing just to muffle the screaming out
(Only remember you love me) Hi-Fi
Stuck in amber and honey
My headache split wide awake
I'll hide the pain for you

Yeah, yeah, no (No)

Four years, really

[Verse 1]
Turn the lights on
I can stay awhile, but you wanna get me off
Think I don't say enough
I won't be runnin' back 'long as I'm faded and
Fucked up 'cause you're gone and the clique gone too
I turned to someone I could hold onto
I didn't understand how it would have backfired
Wonder who I am
Man, who the fuck am I?
I can't take a lie back, now it's stuck outside me
I can't take this shit lightly
If you want an ear, you know where to find me

[Pre-Chorus]
High on IG, flirtin' with a couple homies
I said I'm too eager, couldn't keep you
And she told me, ""Keep it lowkey, only rule is staying open""
I'm like, ""Where'd my line go?""
You just stole it

[Chorus]
Try and catch me tying up loose ends
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I'm past you, didn't wanna fuck you again
Yeah, I just wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I never wanna fuck you again
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends

And I no longer plan to hide in the snow and wait 'til you hold my hand
Now there's a four in five chance that she'll get her fine friend
And I'll be a nine-ten to 'em
Fucked up 'cause you were gone and the clique gone too
Turned into someone people come onto
I didn't understand how I could've macked
Y'all gonna wonder who I am

[Chorus]
Try and catch me tying up loose ends
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I'm past you, didn't wanna fuck you again
Yeah, I just wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I never wanna fuck you again
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends

[Chorus]
D-D-Dropped out, I was seventeen
Wasting all my money, mixing dope and LSD
Man, mama said, ""Don't get ahead of me""
But I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams
Well, I don't know what's gotten into me
Ever since I stopped pretending, it was history
Dropped out, I was seventeen
Now I've got more freedom than I've ever seen

[Verse 1]
Life don't have directions
And I been tryin' to quarantine
The thought of Heaven in the meantime
I've realized I've been there before
All the doors are closed, wanted so much more
Now it's nice to know there's no enemy
Or a victory

[Verse 2]
(What other effects?) I-I-I love my mama
Don't wan' be apart, man
My brothers say just go get an apartment
Flipping the pages to get into the garden
By now the mara taller, treat me like a God, damn
Feelings rolled up and it's 'bout time
Exhale in the ninth cloud, cloud nine
I got money, I'll expand on it
Cancel your plans, authority couldn't handle us

[Bridge]
Okay, this the type shit that make my hands fall asleep
Low blood sugar and some more caffeine
I don't need loving, but I want that cheap
So much luck that I've laughed to pieces
[Verse 3]
Looked inside for some consolation
I found a bi-dime in his prime, embraced it, I
Learned it was never complicated
You are who you are, don't keep you waiting
I said you are who you are, don't keep you waiting
(I can't wait no longer) I said you
(Won't you say something)
I said you are who you are, man (I can't wait no longer)

Dropped out, I was seventeen
Wasting all my money, buying 1P-LSD
Mama said, ""Don't get ahead of me""
But I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams

Ever since I stopped pretending, it was history

I don't know how much more I can take
'Cause I'm gonna need more than sunlight or getting in shape
Weed makes me panic and Lexapro drives me insane
Tell me, how do you do what you love when you're sick in the brain?
And you're two thousand miles away
So why am I stalking your Twitter and lying awake?
I show my true colors, you left and my life got so gray
I can't get over you, yet I built up so much hate
But despite all the lies and projections, I hope you're okay

[Verse 1]
I was tryna make a living
Well I did, and now I don't wanna live at all
And you wonder why I'm distant
My only friend is whatever I was trippin' off
Yeah, but you would never get it
You turned my personality into some kind of fetish
You think it's all copacetic
I hit your pen and then I lost it
Ever since then, I've been manic and exhausted
Think I wanna die and I can't keep my mind off it
Twenty-four-seven headache and I'm always nauseous
Cut my losses, 'cause I can never tеll if it's somethin' I really wanted

Would you fuck off?

Okay, I started all this shit as an outlet
Now everybody plug in where they mouth is
So I burned out, all my thoughts were clouded
I was shocked by the shit that I shouted
And an old friend told me that I sold out
So I laughed and said, ""All I wear is argyle""
'Cause you'd think that maybe I'd set the bar too high
When I'm strugglin' to find a way to waste my time

[Verse 1]
Whenever I approach you
I'm always getting close to
Sayin' it out loud
So take out all the O2
The autumn wind will blow through
You're never gon' find out, out
He said, ""Curse that fallen angel""
How I'm scrapin' up a scheme to serve the plot
(Don't get in my fucking way)
And I know I'm gonna raise Hell
One mistake after another, I forgot
I do not want you to save me

[Chorus]
Boy, I know you love your girlfriend
And she's all you'd ever need
'Cause her love comes straight from source
And I'm a force of social greed
And the doctor said I'm bugging
But I swеar I'm gonna choke
If I keep talkin' in circles
We could trеat it like a joke

But if I had you
I wouldn't have to
Boy, if I had you
Nah, I couldn't have you

[Verse 2]
There's nothing left to turn to
I'm puffing on your virtue
Just to wear my crown (See look, I'm a person, I'm a good person)
I took out all the O2
Hollowed out the whole room
Now I can't make a sound (Like are you proud?)
Now my hair is getting tangled
And I gave up on my body, let it rot
I think he wants my spot, boy, just take it (Ahh)
And I know I'm gonna raise Hell
And mistake you for a lover I forgot (A new persona in Oklahoma)
I do not want you to save me

[Chorus]
Now it's pure dissociation
Maybe I'm already dead
'Cause I'm spendin' every moment
With this existential dread (I'm shaking)
And the doctor said it's nothing
But I swear I'm gonna choke
If I keep talkin' in circles
We could treat it like a joke
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause if I had you (I'm missin' something)
I wouldn't have to
Oh, baby, baby, if I had you (I'm missin' something)
Boy, I thought maybe I could have you
But I couldn't have you, I couldn't have you

[Outro]
Turn me the fuck up!
Global domination
Your soul is mine (Fatality, mm)
Master
(Money, ugh)
You're listening to—
The masters of the shadows, tell me, dear lady
(Can you see the shadows?)
How will you navigate (He's a monster), an uncertain future
Without—, exclusive content (Shut up)
There is nowhere to run
You are now in a state of suspended animation
Magic, mm
The dark side, death is all you will find here
Evil is being carried on the winds of change
Hahaha, yes, a noble sacrifice
Mm, so real, I know you're a monster, but I love you, I love you
King
This is a message from the twelfth of thirteen (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
Brakence has been successfully eradicated (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
We came to the conclusion that he would rather make selfish art than serve a higher purpose (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
So when you hit replay, ask yourself these questions: (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
Who are you really listening to? (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
And where is the line between art and dark magic?
Because that man had no idea

Oh, baby, I only wanted you
I couldn't say it so I'm typin' it on the cue
I fuckin' hate it so I died like a Montague
You think I'm chasin' something, I only wanted you

[Outro]
I found the truth
In solitude
It's concrete proof
That we're all screwed

Slow down, breathe
Slow down, breathe
What's in the ground beneath your feet?
Get off that screen and let it go
A blue check screams
I always whisper what you want
And it was right here all along
'Cause I found something with a taste you can't describe
You take it in and all your roots get intertwined
And every time
I call you back, I know you're fine
I know you're fine

There's no cancer in the water
It's not an answer or a dream
Your mother and your father
Would rather blow it all on ginger tea

Take you and your girl right back to my place
'Cause man or woman, I'ma fuck you the same
Picking me up when she back in my state
A quick flight to NYC for some cake
Touchdown, 50 came in the clutch
My boy's bound for somethin' bigger than us
Cuts deep like a knife, that's the shit you can feel
My mama love me and her willpower steel
Anxious heart 'bouta beat out my chest
I'm sorry 'bout me and I wish you the best
I just wanna fuck, the marijuana get me scared of trauma
But I'm gon' be okay, good sex every day
Great sex like the greatest is fate
Load my plate with acid, salad, and breaks

I got a tab on my tongue, goin' twenty-five over the speed limit, I'm buggin’ (Bloomtodeath)
If you wanna find love, you should watch what kind of beliefs you're puttin' your trust in, yeah
Get out my car at the beehive, I heard the queen died of corruption
So I wanna hollow my funds, honey, keep that, I'm teabagging the cup

[Chorus]
'Cause you gave me the butterflies
Now I'm stayin' up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I’ll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you

[Bridge]
I wonder where I went
Tripped once for fun and I tore a ligament
We can’t blame this on ignorance

And if it's bubblegum-pop, why you still down on your knees saying you love it?

I'm fallin' apart, did I really start that trend?
I'm starting to feel like I never knew my friends
My sunken eyes, oh, weren't they something nice?
But I just should modernize, it's all new, all new

[Verse 3]
So why you wanna link? I'd rather finger fuck strings
And I don't know how to be your lust king
There's a whole planet for what my money's spent on
Your God planned me out and I took His hands off, yeah
No, I don't wanna be intimate
You want me playin' you like an instrument

No

[Chorus]
I really know what's inside of me
And it was never enough
There's not a right or wrong side of me
From now on it's all lust
I'm never lying again
Spent my life sucking up
Whether foe or a friend
Won't be fallin' in love

[Verse 1]
I've been staying up late on IG
'Bout time 'cause you talk just like me
Be patient and then fuck high-key
Leg shakin' in my 10 buck Nikes
Prozac make my hands fall asleep
Low blood sugar and some more caffeine
I don't need love, but I want that cheap
So fucked up that I laugh to pieces
Uh, I can't take it anymore
Fuckboys more fake than before
My hothead aches to my core
I'll hide that under my tongue
You won't be sinning for fun
I wanna fuck up my lungs
To hide the pain from my eyes
It's just so sick to my stomach

[Bridge]
Try
Try, no

[Verse 2]
If I'm honest, I don't give a fuck but
You're cut off, so you wouldn't know nun'
But whatever, 'cause you found someone now
I wanna be a dick for once
Until you know I'm not okay
'Cause everyone is so fucked up
The night is young, I know my fate
But I can't take it anymore
I'm way more fake than before
I wanna fuck up my lungs
I wanna bottle it up
[Chorus]
I really know what's inside me
And it was never enough
There's not a right or wrong side of me
From now on it's all lust
I'm never lying again
Spent my life sucking up
Whether foe or a friend
Won't be fallin' in love

[Outro]
Prozac, no

The Prozac made me fuck my high school crush
In the back of this shithole van

Tell me, dear lady, how will you navigate an uncertain future without the masters of the shadows?
Exclusive

[Verse 1]
I've been tryin' to breathe
Stayin' up past five, grindin' my teeth
Uh, I made a couple of beats
Then the whole 'net started capturin' me
This shit so overwhelming
Mix self-expression with self-obsession
Hellbent, but that's somethin' I don't wanna tell them
Fightin' for my will like the ring is Elden, fuckin' hell, man

[Chorus]
Take a breath bеfore my ego pop
Play a set likе I'm a handmade prop
Put the clay in my oven, a petrified sufferer
Restrain it, that's fear-based art
Tainted flesh, it's why the photos cropped
I'm possessed the way I play my part
Farming hatred like gatherin' trading cards
Spirit degrading, that's fear-based art

[Verse 2]
I don't know why I can't sleep
Lurk 'til the birds chirp, sigh, and repeat
I hit control, alt, delete
And yet I can't stop manufacturing heat
It's the rapture of the beast, you can't grasp it in the least
Buying acid off the deep web
Blasting off for cheap
It's all my fault baby, I'm just too smart
And for that, I think I need to tear my brain apart, uh
You might also like[Chorus]
Take a breath before my ego pop
Play a set like I'm a handmade prop
Put the clay in my oven, and petrify sufferin'
Restrain it, that's fear-based art

I'm possessed the way I play my part
Farming hatred like gatherin' trading cards
Spirit degrading, that's fear-based art

[Bridge]
Shakin', I let it out, but I'm fakin'
How could I be so mistaken
To waste it on fear-based art? (Bloomto—)
Shakin', the power in me awakened
How could I be so mistaken
To waste it on fear-based art?

[Verse 3]
I'm guarded, they don't got my back
In my outlet, chargin' up a heart attack (Shakin')
With my head on a swivel, it give me muscle cramps (Breaking)
And I better not shrivel up, I'm a fuckin' man
It's so divine to judge
I started walkin' down that path beyond the winter months
I started flyin' to L.A. (Shakin') 'cause I could jitterbug
It drove me crazy (Breaking), now I'm certain I'm the chosen one, yeah
[Chorus]
Take a breath before my ego pop (Oh no)
Play a set like I'm a handmade prop
Put the clay in my oven, and petrify sufferin'
Stain it, that's fear-based art
Tainted flesh, it's why the photos cropped
I'm possessed the way I play my part
Farming hatred like gatherin' trading cards (Ah)

[Outro]
My lungs are caving
Spent eight weeks tweaking in the basement
Found a problem in her statement
Do I trust her when she say she wanna get acquainted?
She say she wanna be my best friend
But I can't hang around no yes-men
Shovel fake love out the hole that I stepped in
No time, I already lost my adolescence

But offline, you're nowhere to be seen
You think I'm lying that I'm lettin' you breathe?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd fuck up my life if you told me to
But I don’t need your help
I do it by myself
Maybe a lie is a second truth
But I can never tell (Ooh)
So we can't do this my way

[Chorus]
Suck up all my time for the moment
Drowning in my fault and I know it isn't healthy
But can anybody sell me for this art
I don’t wanna spend time with you, nah
You don't fucking know me bro, just tell me what you got, uh
Before I claim your spot

[Verse]
Still, you're stuck in my favor
It's all the same
You got my attention, but I won't listen
Can't walk with conviction
Been out of state
So how come I'm burnin' out
Tryna make it out of here alive?
I want more from men and women
If we take it slow then I won’t hesitate, yeah
We could do it thirty minutes
And you can ask me any second of the day
I’m gon' miss you, but I’ll never hit the brakes
'Cause I'm fucking or I'm fucked up in my head
And if I ain’t gonna sing that shit you better see me
Work a nine-to-five to fill my plate
So you best watch me pop
When people get the gist, they be like ""Oh my God,"" yeah
I got more time off
Still tryna figure out who you are
Can't put my thoughts to speech unless I steal your magic and I put you on my sleeve

But baby, you don't understand
I don't want no other man
I spent all my serotonin on you
I did everything I can
Just to fuck it up again
I spent all my serotonin on you, ooh

[Verse 1]
Just say whatever you wanna say
A breakdown's wrapped around my face
Because I'm holdin' in the truth
And if I bite my tongue then maybe I won't cry
Had to hollow my lungs and let out a bad lie
I became such a fool, a husk, hallucinating

I am using my imagination

[Verse 1]
I wanted strength, I wanted luck
I wanted money and fame
I wanted everyone to love me and be under my reign
And when an arrow dipped in poison hit the path that I'd take
I knew I never had a choice and it was all up to fate

[Chorus]
To pay the cost to chase a dream
I started starin' at a screen
Now I know everything, boy, I know everything
And now I'm tearin' at the seams
And only God can hear my screams
'Cause I know everything, boy, I know everything

[Verse 2]
Oh, how I'm lеarnin' like a fool, I'm always uppin' the pace

Through all the power trips, the cowardice, the pleasure, and pain

The road so bumpy, don't got a seatbelt

You taught me some compassion while packin' a bowl
I was peekin' through the glass in the back of the show
You put me on track, I won't slack anymore
Now I'm movin' way past irrational
I said ain't it funny?
Got stung by a honeybee
It fell right in front of me
And if I knew well
Maybe I'll learn my lesson
Maybe I'll earn perspective
Maybe I'll take a second chance to slam the door to Hell

So I, I, I've been lookin' in the past for the reason, the devil inside me

Each summer I get happy, 'cause I leave my home
I be runnin' from my past, it won't leave me 'lone
Sometimes I wanna get off of the seesaw
Sometimes I really wish I had amnesia
If you breathe love miss me with my weak lungs
If I want a honey, know I’m gonna be stung
At least once, so you know I gotta keep strung high
With a hunched back and a tough guy guise
I miss those days, I would touch their thigh
Sayin', ""It's okay"" to convince myself of it (Convince myself)
All I can do is put the pen to the pad
They stare at my pattern

Masters of the shadows
They're watching, they're following us

I just took- I just took a fourth of a tab of acid. I'm microdosing right now. And I'm by myself in this house and I'm whispering actually because there is someone home and they're across from me

[Verse]
Yeah
I know you wanna— (Yeah)
I know you wanna be me
I did it so y'all really don't have to
Eat, fuck, and make beats then I fall backwards
Could live my whole life on a twin mattress
Just had to realize that it's all practice
Dropped out in two weeks, I got no manners
She says she wanna fuck with a synth nerd from the suburbs
Ain't a lover or kisser
She don't care if you don't follow her on Twitter
She said her kink is people being honest with her
I've learned to do that
No, I don't overthink shit
I assume absolute fact
Kenny rode on my way in the cold to get
Tools for when old thoughts make me loop back
The crew mackin', I knew Jack before we met
School was trash, I got new cash and I'm not impressed
I'm psyched out, I fly South by South West
And meet friends from featuring on SVNSET
Fuckboy thinks comments are gonna stop me
Dismiss that, this shit's not a hobby
More than enough sauce in my skinny body
Big chillin' like Harlow, my eyes Sonic
So now I'ma really drop
These visions for 2020 when I'm landin' in 50's spot
If I had no streams, it would still feel a milli' hot
'Cause I got a best friend, now we need to meet at the box, no-oh

Bloomtodeath

[Verse 1]
Learned, tryna find myself
It ain't gotta be a one-way fight
But every single time I ask for help
They just talk right over me, assume I'm fine
Now I'm closing every open door
Bent teeth and it's all my fault
I lose grip, wasting all this soul
I'm falling apart

[Chorus]
'Cause no one cares for me, except me
I'm chilling by death, CBD
Baby, was something I said too extreme?
Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care
'Cause no one cares for me, excеpt me
I'm chilling by death, CBD
Baby, was something I said too еxtreme?
Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care
'Cause no one cares for me

[Verse 2]
I just really wish I warned myself (Run)
That because my momma raised me right
I would have to kick you off the shelf
You motherfuckers was a waste of time
Clock's ticking, why would I ever listen?
I don't need supervision, I'm balling with no provisions
I'ma be a musician, I'ma fuck up my life

Text you all damn night, hour unholy
I couldn't get a second of sleep when I found out you were just my type
I was dead wrong but it felt so right
When you caught my gaze with those dark green eyes
And I'm never gon' change thinking 'bout that twice
It's all chord changes and vocal lines
I'm a mess and it looks like you got your shit together
But despite all of my first impressions
I can't imagine what's gonna happen
Get your ass back here

Deny it was best
The rest is left up to the somethings that exist outside my head
Now we've got a wedding for a whole week
Hold each other, remember the thing you told me
Now there's only minutes until this plane leaves
But, wait, did I just leave heaven or is it waitin' there?

[Chorus: brakence & 50Landing]

I don't know me outside this head
You reminded me of what I thought free meant
And so we made a friendship out of finding out who we are
And I’ve stopped trying since you told me
I'm only what I want
That ain't me

[Chorus]
So could you call me over without the bitter hesitation
And place your money where your mouth is?
All my thoughts are clouded
But I can still say I’m 'bout it soon as my head gon' cave in
Oh and if I had the chance to remake all of my decisions
Well, I wouldn't take it
Because you got me fucked up but if I don't use this as agency
I'll never change

But sincerely it’s my fault
I've been chasing the answer to what it is we want
And I ain't found it out yet
But I'll wait for the right time
Gotta few bad voices, I might lie
So just tell me if you've had enough
I don't want you stressed out
So pray to God, the best of me is showing when I'm with you
Got a ways to go, my eyes are open is that an issue?
And I'm prone to show a lack of potency
It's like fuck my indecision, I need to restore my focus
'Cause I've been wasted on myself, I'll just let you know
Ain't past mistakes that I made, I don't let it go
I can't forget anything need you to hold me over once again
[Refrain]
I take you everywhere with me
Waiting for a day to arrive
'Cause I can think I'm on fire
Every time you burn out my eyes

So call me over without the bitter hesitation
And place your money where your mouth is

And I've been hurting tryna pull this out my chest
Is there another way to say that I won't talk to you again?
I won’t talk to you again

'Cause I ain't doing favors, maybe confounded
Couldn't give a fuck about it
I ain't doing favors, on the way get grounded

Put your money where your mouth is
I ain't doing favors, if longevity is out there
Need amenity, you—

Know I’m coming for the neck
I-I don't wanna be provocative
I just ain't tryna breathe your oxygen
Why you going round startin' shit?
I've found that need no argument
You committed cardinal sin
Knees weak, no sleep, we gon' drift apart
Just mark in it, ain't no meager feat
But fuck off, tryna politic
And chase my goals, I can't date it back
I don't wait for shit, I ain't made for that
We got the same flow, whoa, where'd it go?
Need to change clothes, still blow it up like a staple fact, and I'm gone
Then spend all my luck on Twitter
Know me, found I ain't the same in winter
But this a marathon and all these fuckboys sprinters
Gonna paint a moral high ground, that's a painkiller
You can feed me lies if you're compelled
I'ma be frank for my health

Say that you ain't bugging, you lucid
Ain't it funny how you can't prove it?

I ain't doing favors, if longevity is out there
I need amenity, you out here

[Verse 3]
Fuck you, you too basic for a maybe
You lucky if you waitlisted, I'm lazy
I'm stuck on a few pages in a daydream
No one's gonna be able to save me
These days self-hatred is motivation
Spreads outside me and I'm running out patience
Let you lie but cut you out the equation
Never liable, when bluffing I never say shit
Where'd the mood go? Flip the beat like judo
You got that fools gold, say you don't you do though
On my feet, uh, ain't no mass appeal, uh
Pity a leader, wouldn't wanna be you
And I've been waiting way too long to be free from ya'
Free from ya'
[Outro]
I'll remember this up out the top of my head
No etiquette 'cause I won't edit with the thought of a threat
Make your bets, this ain't Reddit, won't argue on in no thread
It's art, taking shots in the dark, beat already dead
Couldn't give less of a fuck what you say
'Cause I'm a gifted mess and I'm stuck in my ways
Everybody want a feature, I won't ask for no pay
A teacher by night, preacher by day, but don't actually pray
I'm that kinda fake, I hold that kinda weight
Float leave a passionate wake
I ain't burning no rubber
I'm back in action, been averting stunners since day one
I'll curve a sucker 'cause they too basic like A1
And it hurts to say this but don't call my line
I've been done with you since autumn, you ain't worth my time
The fuck does it take get out the Matrix and learn your lie?

You wanna be that way
Well,  dive in
Dive  in my holy ghost

[Verse 1]
I was never worried 'bout the six feet
I just wonder why it wouldn't kill me
I  ain't get above in the fifties
And  I know this isn't makin' up for lost time
No difference made, but now I know mine
Makin'  the same mistake for my whole life
Now I'm gotta keep it all tongue-tied
Forty-five minutes 'til you're really gettin' tired
And you'll keep your distance, oh my God
I  don't need the time, I just want your love
And no thought and prayers and heartfelt lies gon' play
I guess I don't know the faith I got
It wasn't myself, it wasn't my boss
And now all this searching brought me back to say that

[Chorus]
I don't care 'bout a stare or judgment
I don't care, I don't care
And I don't care what your friends want from me
Play it fair, I don't care, no, no

It's why he always got a issue, never givin' respect
So I just stick to plans 'cause this shit fun, now I got a mentor
Toxic engagement is not what I'm motherfucking meant for
I'll kill your reason with an MC Sony camcord

No, oh, I don't wanna play the game no more
I don't wanna play that game no more, oh
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna, uh
I don't wanna waste my funds
Doing somethin' I don't love, give a little bitty fuck, I don't, uh
I don't know where the passion in my subs
So I'll get it on my own, what's inside of me is enough like (Mmm)
I don't want no points, sin or holy (Yeah)
I don't call shots and I ain't no Kobe
I tried to wear a collar, tried to be a goalie
I'm done with all them roles, you can sell me off as a phony
[Chorus]
I don't care 'bout a stare or judgment
I don't care, I don't care (I don't care)
And I don't care what your friends want from me
Play it fair, I don't care, no, no (Mm, no-woah)

But lived through it when my voice arose
The path is littered with hurdles taller than coffee
I avoided loads of problems in that skinny body
But my purpose is more than callin' my fault
Write in homage
That's a whole lot
God knows, I promise I'm gon' grow from the hate
Yeah, I feel the love when it goes away

(Okay)

[Verse 1]
I hold onto patience for them
And reflect their mannerisms when I can't focus
Tired of selfish things I've said but never really spoken
I can't take back what I did when I forgot
So, I lack poise and, yeah, I noticed
But I drove it into the ground like it was poison
And I said I got a problem, will you show me?
But just because I need your help, don't mean it’s important
And now

(None of us knows, Major. We don't know who we are)
You know
(We don't know where we are)

Just know, I'm trying
But I faked you out on my end
And behind those shaded words
I partake in limbo, not violence
'Cause I'm just trying to feel like
More than my entry
I can't tell by deceit I'm alright and
It's 'bout time I show I've been lying
'Cause I can't wait back for it here
The only fear I'm in love with is pointless
I don't need luck, I need somebody's help for a minute
'Cause I've tried long enough
Pray I lost, I am done

[Bridge]
Change my mind 'cause I'll be broken if there's nothing left to say

[Verse 3]
Just know I'm trying
But within a second it's timed in
(I've just never heard of them before)
Minding every word, and it's taking over afraid to love
But I will keep you around
You say I'm onto something, I doubt it
I find God in mind
Now I'm waking up and taking on my pride

Uncomfortably breeds growth (Okay)
That's the main thing I learned about it
In order for me to grow I gotta be uncomfortable as hell with everything
Do you think that it makes your music relatable in a way?
It makes me adapt
In which way?
Like, being vulnerable, having people come at me, like, surrendering myself to the world

[Chorus]
Looking for a stipend my drive is loaded
I think I can find it the more you know me
I just copped the right to extort my purpose
In a one track climate with no disturbance
All the same witcha, you believe your source shit
Can’t get your main with ya, she don’t need your bullshit
98% of all my flows are stolen
'Cause the greatest artists are the ones that notice

[Verse 1]
I get it going no I’m never turning it down
I’m finding my liking I strike indeterminates out and
If I’m all blood I’ll be flooding the tourniquet route
I’m breaking the boundaries I’m faking this tournament out
Like why lil' techie got a trendy flow
Because he reckons that it’d grant your trust

Oh, in, like, in your own way, right?
Yeah, and that's what, that's what the new artists are doin'
[Verse 3]
I caught you dreaming
You’re soon to adopt how you find your meaning
I break my ceiling
I’m a lot, head’s hot but the baby freezing
That’s on my hearing
Still why would they love me I’m way past my season
For the time being
I will not give a fuck I don’t need no reasons

What’s the reason you got manners?
What do you stand for?

This is what I've discovered

[Verse 1]
I used to know my ethic
Now I'm bouncing off the walls of my intent
And I want everyone to know me
But I'm looking past required interaction

'Cause I've been looking down your path like a mental quickscope
Look in your direction realize that you wan' be friends though
Talking 'bout release dates, dominate my end goals
Yeah, I know I can do it, just gotta put in elbow (br-brakence)

[Verse 2]
Bad talk, good luck (Ay)
I'm lacking my funds (Ay)
Got no face on my passport
Got no haze in my lungs (Ay)
I just sit there and flashback
Fall backwards, I backtrack
Don't call me stupid, I'm dumb
Don't call me Cupid, 'cause, uh
Brakence made a brand new sound now
And if you hear it you won't wanna fuck with me
Worst handshake in the world
But when I show up they still wanna be stuck to me
'Cause I don't really care about the flux
Just your drive and your passion to do something that you love
Act up, yeah, I got it from the Wi-Fi
Everywhere I go want to see her in the night-time
Keep me up late, got me doing all the right crime
And running my ego right off a mattress
Think you're funny but really you stuck in past tense

I can hear it now through everything you say
My time is up, I have to take myself away
And erase myself from all of my mistakes
If I'm too scared to, let me know

[Verse 1]
And I won't change 'cause I'm for nothing
I can't keep on moving on
Won't take a second chance again
'Cause all I do is tear more thoughts from your head
This should be simple on my end

[Bridge]
End it now and you'll be set, you understand

[Verse 2]
And I owe this my life
I found hope in sound, I thought I couldn't write
And just because I'm letting out my patient side
Don't mean I got this

The glass is on the floor
Don’t wanna be opaque
That’s my main goal and it ain’t in my domain
I ain’t really rocking with no grill or propane
Backing up is only honest when your god oppose fate
And if I wrote a song about it
It’d probably take a day or two, the power lane
'Cause you’re the reason I’m okay
You’re the reason (Yeah)
My ass can’t park in the left end
You’re an obvious blessing
Still, tarnish each second
With thoughts of your facial expression
Sidebar did I mention
I lost my intentions this weekend
They’re wasted and I’ma fade out
Kinda complacent the way I indite my breakdown
Don’t freestyle you a free-form feat
Doubt your resource, we all know you see short of that clear fact
But maybe it’s not a thing that you can handle
But you should know you got me
And know I understand you
Showing up a commie
Abide by the law tell your dogs
Let 'em all know how you rebel
You ain’t no mess 'cause

You know this ain’t automatic, you just practice

[Verse 2]
Well, I’ll confess I can’t remember the last time I felt this exhausted
God knows I ain’t jaded, though
Ego focused on the stats
Tell your friends I’m coming up
Like my fuckin' MPH on the dashboard the more I drive
I’m getting reckless but
But I just wish you could stay the night
Remember Cincinnati, shit was fire
5AM I saw a pretty sight
It’s the small things that count most so don’t hate your height
I still got friends in my cycle
5 days in 2 days out, my Bible
Can’t change habits that’s a working title
I been on a constant downward spiral
[Pre-Chorus]
Like, I’m over my head I can’t breathe
You're fine and way older than me
I ain’t no freeloader
I’ll keep more composure the closer I get to you

[Verse 3]
Yeah, we’re way too close to goodbye
And I feel like I ain’t had the time to start
You can’t ever be replaced
Known you since seventh grade
That’s real shit, I live amazement
And I remember, as soon I got a moment with you I took it
Hoping you wouldn’t ignore me
Laughing over songs we distorted
I was losing sleep over you, cutie
Every time you performed you would bleed and it moved me

(brakence)
We keep doubling our words and this doubling is comparable to Oscillation
When you get to think that you think your thoughts
The you standing aside the thoughts has the same sort of consequence of seeing double
I am worried and I ought not to worry, but because I can’t stop worrying, I am worried because I worry and that is what we call anxiety, trembling

Yeah, I know for a fact that it's my fault
I know for a fact that I'll resolve
Somebody take me away from (Haha)
'Cause I know for a fact that it's my fault
And I'm trying to live with a result
Yeah, I know for a fact that it's my fault

I will do my best to overcome when winter's no more

4239146,​brakence,​nervosa2,"5 Contributors​nervosa2 Lyrics[Intro: Jordan Peterson]
What you do with people who are afraid and-and to some degree depressed, but certainly anxious is: you lay out what-what they're anxious about first of all in-in detail what is it that you're afraid of, what might happen, and then you decompose it into a small problem
And then you have the person expose themselves to the thing they're afraid of and what happens is that they get less afraid, that's what the clinical literature indicates exactly
What happens instead is that they get braver

[Verse 1]
You are known to be awkward
If she selfish, you wouldn’t walk over
You don’t even want to talk about it
You just want to hit the gas forward
You just want to fucking ask for it
You don't ever want to argue
You don’t ever want an issue
You don’t even gotta take orders
You know well, she never fake offers
Will it go to plan or cascade off it
In front of everything you made
Fuck it till you're confident enough for fucks sake
Gotta take off with your smug face
Gotta codepend on what’s next for you
You know how to do this well don’t you
Only done enough to fake

[Chorus]
You been holding onto shit for a minute
You don’t need my luck you got retention
Only need to fuck up like you invented
Only reason why this worked out for you
And it’s looking like this time you got blurred vision
Only been up front since been forgiven

Wait that’s not good reason the crying
You better look into her eye before the shutter
It’s only everything you wanted in the front row
Know you been faking ever since the sun rose
Every week you're thinking your luck froze
No more sheets can cure your what you’ll upvote
So you just keep waiting for the time being that I'll walk out front

(brake-e-ence)
You know I think about it way too much
I just wanna feel my fate, like, I don't know how to touch you safely
(Your DJ has only just begun)

[Verse 1]
So what if you're not confident?
You feel that way to me, so don't look for more offerings
To bother you with how you're following a fuckin' part of you
If opposite, at least you got a starting point but it's hard to do
This is far from taking mainstage
I'll park the car away from over where the cane sprays
I need an argument for my obnoxious ways I shake state
To override my comfort zone, depart it and I'm on pace
But I don't need to race
Always say if you need some space
Be more safe if you open gates
I'll be waiting to do you favors
I swear this in my nature
My patience is open acres, I care if you're faking playfulness
And my lies all slowly faded so I cried and then I faced it
I don't even know my patience
I'm not clean
But I am not waste
I took his ego to the movies, that's a docked case

[Verse 1]
Baby, I’m bad with you
But I don’t really need a head to be loose with truth
Want a little bit of that from you
'Cause I can’t focus on my craft when I’m at the booth
And I been getting all these DMs at my table
They asking questions 'bout my style and my labels
Like you make EDM? That joke’s a fucking fable
Pick it up and spit it back, soon it’s gonna pay off
Middle finger to the labels that own men
I ain’t signing I ain’t doing this for more bands
You probably saying I’m a fake 'cause I’m on SVNSET
Got me fucked up 'cause a paper I ain’t poked yet
And your main thing want me but I don’t want her
Got one little baby I devote my love
And if you’re chattering smack then just let me know my fault
If we ain’t cool I’m willing to improve on it

I don’t know what really hit me, I hope they fit
Catch me in they crib I’m grinning I’m fucking sick
And I’m sinning I ain’t wishing, won’t resubmit
Plus I’m always with my hippies I love 'em, kill me

And I’m over it now you think you’re more than that but it’s been years since I felt this relieved
And all the smug talk
Compensates for everything you said that got me so lost
You don’t wanna hear me maybe I should just stop talking
Plus you probably calling out my name now

But I’ve always been sure that
You ain’t know about my sound

And I'm finding what I can make
So if you're looking for a staple, you can get out my way
And I just want the people 'round me to be stuck in their place
Don’t need to stay so apprehensive if I just stay awake
It’s you need me or you don't, girl
Say, ""I don’t need you, I need your world""
Everyone is moving forward
With their conscience and their God's plan
So give me more of what you wanted
Give me what you never saw
When you wouldn't look me in what I meant
But it's alright if you need some more time

Brakence in the second round now
And I don’t even feel like I need a rest
Got a bag of the luck
EP next week and I’m unimpressed
Now I consider that I myself I’m a successful man in business
I hate business
Play this record as frequently as-
I hate everything to do with it;
Accounting, figuring, adding up numbers
Brakence
Because they’re all arid. They don’t smell of anything but sometimes there’s an interesting smell to the ink on a checkbook But by and large I don't like it

[Verse 1]
Brakence in the second round now
And I don’t even feel like I need a rest
Got a bag of the luck
EP next week and I’m unimpressed
At 16, I bought my boo a bouquet
17 years I’ma kill the kit in no saves
I just drop the habits that make my life fucking gray
I’m so jealous of my future I need to pick up the pace like
I don’t wanna change my tone
But I couldn’t do this on my own, ay
And if anybody call my phone
I’m like we get no beef, we’re crop grown, ay
I don’t even need credit
When I work witcha I’ma get hitched
Do my thing then I make connections
No one knows where I’m 'bout to go

And I’m done staring at the ceiling
With the thought that I’m gon' get there one day
Just give me answers, baby
At least my life is taking shape
'Cause I’m about to keep that up

Gimme more time
Fuck my inhibition
Y'all don’t need me you just feed me lies, you’re not forgiven
We are words high
So I don’t need prescriptions
Do y'all bleed
I don’t think you got no nervous system

[Bridge 2: Brakence & Alan Watts]
No one can stop me now
I’m worthless but I got sound

And I know
Who you are

And curiously there are very few roles in life which ah
Provide this possibility writer and sometimes musician
Sometimes the independent consultant can occupy this role
And I know
Who you are

Sometimes the independent consultant can occupy this role

Got a hunch that you don’t like me but I understand it

(I don't even wanna give you credit)
God, it's so fun (There I said it)
'Cause I'm a, 'cause I'm a- ('Cause I'm a-)

[Verse 1]
Hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack
The things I'd do to see you smile
But I never really want you back
You got a new girlfriend and a frame of mind
But I don't even wanna give you credit
'Cause I'm jealous and I hate my life

[Bridge]
Way down, get on my side (Get on my side)
Stay down, get on my side
Wait til-, get on my side

[Chorus]
But then I realize that it's all for you-ooh, you-ooh

A hypochondriac
I chеck the news, I'm terrifiеd
It's all my gut reaction
Become the latest fashion
'Cause when I'm in love with something, I'll break it
Got a heart of gold, but I'll waste it
Insanely high expectations
I gotta let it go and just face it

[Bridge]
For now, I'm going nootropic (Way down, get on my side)
Get in place, speak down, you want something? I got it, yeah (Stay down, get on my side)
You in a mob and it show, I'm on that eight feet down (Wait til-, get on my side)
Got no heart but (Way down if you're fucking with me)

Hello, you have reached the third of thirteen's hypnotherapeutic veneficium cyber delivery portal. We have successfully trapped the man you may know as brakence and have no interest in returning him to your dimension. In fact, even he has no interest in returning. He has begun to build a relationship with our most talented contractor and is willingly participating in our emotional extraction program. Humans have a fascinating ability to force emotions down and let them build up ovеr time. Emotions that hold incredible powеr to the order of both love and hatred. Our species uses charged truth energy, which happens to be the byproduct of human emotional release, as fuel for interdimensional exploration. Sharing emotions among humans has been shown to cause empathetic chain reactions. We intend to publish this man's extractions in order to cause a chain reaction, leaving us with a fuel surplus. I will leave you with extraction 003, which unfortunately was damaged due to the man's excess resistance. We will be publishing increasingly potent extractions shortly. Thank you for your time

[Chorus]
(I'm using my imagination)
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week

Oh, it's like you're released or you're free or...
I don't know how I can tell you
How do you feel inside?
Inside?
I don't have an inside

I'll never call my friends

Yes, everything is one

I am one with what I am

Everything... you have to see the air
You can't believe it
And everything is coming down through you and moving

I'd like to find the word because I can ordinarily find them, but it seems to me that... uh...
I can't seem to want to say what I was going to say

[Verse]
Kind to the floor when I walk
I'm just taking all my time
I'm so original
I just don't wanna fuck up
It's not intended to get her attention in my head
The last time that I ever looked up was the time I told her she was beautiful
I'm fucked up, buzzing
And I might as well buy myself an ego check from the neurotic fever I just failed to let go
I don't care so much about my social responses
When I feel this good the future doesn't fucking matter
And I'm laying, rest, when I stay up myself till one then I fade
Then I fade
I give myself a headache, I'm gonna show up late
I'm trying to give it time, but I'm falling for the preface
It's not blank
I'm trying to tell her how I think

[Chorus]
I need faith
In what pride I have
And to exchange my witnesses
'Cause I don't know them now
But I will
After I fall apart
And I can't see it
'Cause I'm not equipped

This is an S.O.S. from the second of thirteen. We have entered an unknown stage of emotional development with our subject brakence. There is now a green light beaming from his forehead. We may have made a mistake getting him that iced americano. He hasn't been listening to our orders and is grinning with devious determination. We believe he may be scheming to shoot the sun. We arеn't pleased, to say the lеast. Shooting the sun is the highest risk, highest reward move in the game of hearts. If he doesn't pull back his bow far enough, the arrow will fail to reach its target and begin falling back down to earth. It will then reach him at terminal velocity and he will be impaled right between the eyes, which is exactly from where our precious truth energy emanates. However, he is so blindly confident in his ability to accomplish this that it might just work. But in that case, we have a whole new problem on our hands. We are urgently asking listeners to immediately delete any links or references to caffei—

Think I'm dreaming
This isn't real
'Cause you leave in a month
And I'm fiending for something to feel
When you hold me
Know you know me down to my core
This is the calm before the storm
You diverted attention away when I mentioned
That someone else gon' need you more

[Chorus]
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me, oh, oh

And I fell apart in that bed
What we built isn't me
Won't put it back together again
I can't take back what I said
I just look through those messages I left on read
And I took you to Rosier ‘cause I thought we could cope
We got out on the ocean, I fell out my boat
And you calmed me back down
And you gave me some hope

I backtrack on normalizing phrases
It’s more important when the green is gone
She feels the same way
I like to think it means exactly what it is
But it’s probably a social kind of thing

[Verse]
I don’t think I’ve ever known one higher
If you drop hints I’m okay with that
Is this another distraction?
I’ve had more than one before
Is it my fault that I’m calling it beforehand?
'Cause you keep accepting his presence and I don’t know why I forget every time
I don’t want to mistake this for the LED lying and
I know enough not to hypothesize, but I can’t tell
[?]

I don’t think I have a chance to read you

8892765,​brakence,​imintoyou,"2 Contributors​imintoyou LyricsAre inside here, you know?
You get an insight, and you know something, you know
But you don't wanna say it out loud
Because you're kind of afraid that it's not gonna be really true
And it'll spoil the whole thing for you
But when somebody makes you say it, then, and it's true
Then it just makes it more beautiful of a thing

I'm into you
It isn't my fault (Who are you?)
I'm into you, isn't my fault
No, I'm into you, isn't my fault
I'm into you (Who are you?)
Isn't my fault

And I am [?], know me [?]
And I just walked out
Backwards forwards
It's all sequence
When is my head [?] breaks [?]
When I'm thinking

I regret not taking chances (Who are you?)
Because I chose that ego was grantеd
And why did I resist friendship?
And I don't know why, but I meant it, ohYou might also likeEmbed",1,/songs/8892765,​imintoyou by ​brakence,https://images.genius.com/98b20088a9c5557b090e6797f0eff48c.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/98b20088a9c5557b090e6797f0eff48c.500x500x1.jpg,13291904,complete,/Brakence-imintoyou-lyrics,,https://images.genius.com/98b20088a9c5557b090e6797f0eff48c.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/98b20088a9c5557b090e6797f0eff48c.500x500x1.jpg,​imintoyou,https://genius.com/Brakence-imintoyou-lyrics,/albums/1009523,https://images.genius.com/34bf77812098be16aae14eb09a187f00.1000x1000x1.jpg,RISING TIDES 005 by SVNSET WAVES,1009523.0,RISING TIDES 005,"February 25, 2017",https://genius.com/albums/Svnset-waves/Rising-tides-005

(I don't wanna be that person)
(I don't wanna be that kind of person)
(Be that kinda person)
(Yeah, yeah)
Hmm, hmm, mm—
I wish I sounded like Frank Ocean
I dont, so I'll—,I'll just go with what I got

[Verse 1]
Hold that shit on replay, then told you
""I ain't got nothin' to lose,"" so I'm flipping over
I'm flipping over
Yeah
""Hold that shit for another day,"" you said, lookin' at me across the room
And I got more gas for the road than my opponents
So let it fall right through, yeah
If you weren't around, I'd probably stop making my decisions sober
But I still be all, and no matter when you call and only when you want me too

[Chorus]
And I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person
I ain't fuckin' with the fakes, you know I know that for certain
We get in the momеnt, flirting with time, we're pacing it
So I don't need first placе, I could just hold you in person
I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person
I ain't fuckin' with the fakes, you know I know that for certain
We get in the moment, flirting with time, we're pacing it
So I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person, yeah

You're a tough guy, little bombshell
For the game, or put your [?]
'Cause you only want what you know well
Well I think that I'm ready, or ready enough
Well if there ain't no watches, I'll tailor shit to a coffin
If you frame, I wonder, and lock it in a compartment
Show my words off, I mean in person
That's who we were once, get a little work done, when I'm gone
I'ma just stand my line, yeah
I ain't gonna break that trust, yeah
They ain't fuckin' with us
She waitin' for a day where you don't got nothin' to pray for
Go your way, you're made for
But i'ma get her on her feet, when I pray for her
Innovate, won't pay for her
Cause' this ain't neighbor, it's a grey war

[Chorus]
I ain't in first place, I could just hold you in person
I ain't fuckin' with the fakes, you know I know that for certain
We get in the moment, flirting with time, we're pacing it
So I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person
