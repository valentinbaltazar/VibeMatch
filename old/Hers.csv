I guess I knew this would happen to you
Inside I did, but I refused to know the truth
I'm headin' back inside to sit at home with you
I think I know what's wrong
My friends put on their bravest face
Their tails between their legs, something's out of place
I bet their mothers let them know what I'm about to face
Keep your mouth zipped, son

[Chorus]
Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hangin' on
I was at the end of every tether waitin' for what once was

[Verse 2]
Tell me all the important stuff
What's your favorite color, what makes you so tough?
Please don't let go when you've had enough
I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hangin' on

We don't have to know
Anyone at all
Anyone at all
Draw the blinds back slow
Sun fades in our room
Two begin to bloom
Silk skin lovers danced
With diamonds in their hands
Diamonds in their hands
We could feel like them
Rarely would we ask
Of things we used to have

[Chorus]
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that news to you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call

[Verse 2]
We don't have to go
Anywhere at all
Anywhere at all
Bless our garden's growth
Ivy climbs the wall
Heather in the fall
Smoke-screen those who stand
So righteous in our path
That never thought to ask
We'll define what's fair
Oh baby they prefer
Illusion to despair

I see their heads against the windows
Breathing on the glass
Dreaming of the day that they can finally relax
If only this normality
Belonged to more than fantasy
It's too much

[Verse 3]
Well they're hoping and faking
They're curled in disdain
The flowers too tall for the table again
But it's alright, they called it faith

Buttercup, call me up, Saturday night
Say whatever, do whatever you like
I'll be waiting on the end of the line
All I want is for you to be mine

[Verse 1]
She has me hanging on her every word
Her silver tongue, leading me on
It gives me a feeling that I don't deserve
She's next to none, she's next to none

I like to think she sits and curls the cord
As we convey, day after day
But hers is a love that I cannot afford
Till I've been paid, till I've been paid

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But baby I'm not like those guys
I just wanna talk all night
Imagine that we're holding hands
Then maybe you'll understand
That I am losing my mind for you

Buttercup, call me up, Saturday night
Say whatever, do whatever you like
I'll be waiting on the end of the line

Working the overtime to hear her voice
Feeling withdrawal, needing to call
Holding my breath until she's made her choice
Once and for all, once and for all

She might forever be a fantasy
And do me wrong until I'm gone
Sweet-talking all the way to bankruptcy
Dying alone, next to the phone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But baby I'm not like those guys
Tell me all about your life
And maybe if you don't pretend
You will finally comprehend
That I am losing my mind for you

Say whatever, do whatever you like
I'll be waiting on the end of the line

Leave your head
You're tryna to figure what she's thinkin'
It could be nothin'
Nothin' but a premonition
But it's hard to say you'll brush it off
That feelin' of losing her
Overweighs the facts
You gotta let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
No time for feelin' bad
Only adds weight to your mind
No sign of getting back
Loosen that grip on your pride

[Chorus]
She'll take her time
Making her mind
Sit back, don't think it over
You'll be alright

[Verse 2]
Still, you sweat
Over what she could be doing
It's a simple threat
Is it only the beginnin'?
Did you wake up late and take a bath
Won't write back until you ask

I await your return at the window
And reach out for your paw
We were tried and true from the get-go
But now we've been separated too long
Still, my stomach deflates on the floor
Just pouring with regret
I hold onto my only memento
A shed of fur you left on my bed

[Chorus]
You should've known that
It was all for love, we had to fall apart
I'll never forget
All the days we had and still forgive myself
One day you'll let go
And maybe you'll think of me once in a while
You should have known that
It was me who made you pull a broken smile

[Verse 2]
And the cats don't know which way to turn
Their captain has moved on
""Has he taken a nap in the dirt?""
""I bet they buried him under the lawn""
But I pray you've forgotten the lot
On a lap of luxury
'Cause every hour I surface the thought
Of you just trying to get back to me

And it tears me deep inside

And we will live each day in the springtime
'Cause loving you
Has made my life so beautiful
And every day of my life
Is filled with loving you

Loving you
I see your soul come shining through
And every time that we 'ooh'
I'm more in love with you

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
No one else can make me feel
The colors that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in the springtime
'Cause loving you
Is easy 'cause you're beautiful
And every day of my life
Is filled with loving you

[Verse 6]
Loving you
I see your soul come shining through
And every time that we 'ooh'
I'm more in love with you

[Hook]

7215718,Her’s,Some Nights,"2 ContributorsSome Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some nights I wonder if she's sleeping
Is she caught up on how I'm feeling?
I'll be up 'til God knows, dreaming of you
'Til then I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
Those sleepless nights make you feel lonely
Wish I could help you out, my honey
I'll be up 'til God knows, dreaming of you
My one and only

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I love the way that you can teach this
I never thought that I could be this
I'll be up 'til God knows, dreaming of you
My one and only
