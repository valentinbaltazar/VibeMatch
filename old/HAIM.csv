You know I'm bad at communication
It's the hardest thing for me to do
And it's said it's the most important part
That relationships go through
And I gave it all away, just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

[Verse 2: Danielle Haim]
You know there's no rhyme or reason
For the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind
Not intentionally
I know it's hard to hear me say it
But I can't bear to stay in
I just know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Danielle Haim]
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Oh, but I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

[Verse 3: Alana Haim]
No need to use your imagination
Try and make it what you want it to be
Because I'm sorry I did what I did, but
It came naturally
And I gave it all away just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

[Verse 4: Este Haim]
When I tried to keep myself together
After all the opportunities
I tried to stay true to you
And I tried to do what you wanted from me
And I gave it all away just to hear you say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway (Hey!)

Some things are long forgotten
Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart
I said we were opposite lovers
Said it from the beginning
You kept tryin' to prove me wrong
Said you'd always see it through
And I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart

[Chorus: All]
But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

[Verse 2: Danielle, Alana & Este]
I know it's hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don't take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself
And I had a fear of forgiveness
Said it from the beginning
I was too proud to say I was wrong
Said you'd always see it through
But all that time is gone, no more fearing control
I'm ready for the both of us now

I met two angels, but they were in disguise
Took one look to realize
Tell 'em anything and they will sympathize
These arms hold me tight
Old fears, helped to ease them in my mind
New tears say that they will dry in time

[Chorus: Danielle]
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Hallelujah

Laughing together like our thoughts are harmonized
Been that way since '95
Give me direction when it is hard to fight
Three roads, one light
Now and then I can lean my back to yours
Travelin' like our feet don't touch the floor

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?

I had a best friend but she has come to pass
One I wish I could see now
You always remind me that memories will last
These arms reach out
You were there to protect me like a shield
Long hair, running with me through the field
Everywhere, you've been with me all along

Los Angeles
Give me a miracle, I just want out from this
I've done my share of helping with your defense
But now I can't dismiss
It's killing me
Hometown of mine
Just got back from the boulevard, can't stop crying
The guy at the corner shop gave me a line and a smile
I know he was trying
But a lie is a lie

[Chorus]
On these days, these days, I can't win
These days, I can't see no visions
I'm breaking, losing faith
These days, these days
(These days, these days)
These days, these days
(These days, these days)

[Verse 2]
New York is cold
I tried the winter there once, nope
Clearly the greatest city in the world
But it was not my home
I felt more alone

These days, these days, I can't win
These days, I can't see no visions
I'm breaking, losing faith
These days, these days
(These days, these days)
I'm thinking about leaving

[Outro]
Sometimes I speed down Crescent Heights
I can't hardly feel it running every light
But I wasn't fazed 'cause it wasn't mine
Was I just dreaming?
And every time I think I might (Send my love, send my tears)
(Waving back to my fears)
Leave this city for the first time (City of mine)
I wake up on the other side (Send my love, send my tears)
Oh-oh (Waving back to my fears)
Wondering, ""Was I just dreaming?"" (City of mine)
""Was I just dreaming?"" (Send my love, send my tears)
Oh-oh (Waving back to my fears)

On the way down
A fall from grace
I was in for a heavy one
When I could feel you pull away
On the way down
It all was too much to take
Even though I tried, it was never enough
We're running in the same damn place

[Pre-Chorus]
But I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end
I was innocent, I was innocent
I know you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got something to tell you
But I don't know why
It's so hard to let you
Know that we're not seeing it eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you
That everything's alright
We could stay in this moment

Man from the magazine, what did you say?
""Do you make the same faces in bed?""
Hey, man, what kind of question is that?
What did you really want me to say back?
What's going on behind those dark glasses?
Is this what you think making a pass is?
Wondering which door could get me out fastest
When I tell it now

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear
It is what it is, it was what it was
I don't want to hear
It is what it is, it was what it was
You don't know how it feels, you expect me to deal with it
'Til I'm perfectly numb
But you don't know how it feels

[Verse 2]
Man from the music shop, I drove too far
For you to hand me that starter guitar
""Hey, girl, why don't you play a few bars?""
Oh, what's left to prove?

Looking up at the ceiling
It's been making me feel creepy
I'm just trying to shake this feeling

Gave you my love, you gave me nothing
Said what I gave wasn't enough
You had me feeling I was foolish for ever thinking
This could be the one
I wasn't even in the running
Already had your mind made up
You left me searching for a reason why'd you leave
Left me in the dust

[Chorus: Danielle, Este]
And now you're saying that you need me, babe
Right now, right now
Now you're saying that you need me, babe
Right now, right now
Now you're saying that you love me, love me, baby
Right now, right now
Now you're saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Right now

[Verse 2: Danielle]
Gave you my love, thought I could trust you
You let me down at every turn
You had me hanging on a dream you never believed
You gave me your word
Finally on the other side now
And I could see for miles
And I've forgotten every line

One thing or two things
Never really mattered that much to me
Now all these apologies are on repeat
Is it destiny or just chemistry?
We're living in such extremes
And life won't wait around

[Chorus]
So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line

[Verse 2]
One thing's true
Every memory leads back to you
Got your hat in the back faded up
Camo tee in the crease of the passenger seat
And every time I try to leave them out
My feelings come back around

[Chorus]
So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line
But are we gonna give it another try?
But are we gonna give it another try?

Talk to me nice or don’t talk to me

[Verse 1: Haim]
I found it hard, tried to reserve
I’ll get it right when I am hurt
(Hot for me)
Romance is on
(Hot for me)
To her he’ll go
(Hot for me)
But I’ll be fine
(Hot for me)
‘Cause I know

[Pre-Hook: Haim]
He’s in her heart, on the floor thinkin' that I’ll never know
I’ll be up going through crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head seein' all the words I’ve said
Honey, honey I am never coming home again

[Hook: Haim]
I’ve been lied to
So what’s the truth?
No I'm not gonna hide it all, keeping it all from you
I’ve been dying to know what you tried
You’ve been lying so
Honey, I’m not your honey pie

If you want to see me, baby please
Been holding for on eternity
Say you only want me
Missing you never led to much of anything
If you wanna know, if you wanna show me
Everything’s what it seems, seems to be
Held by a thread
Tried to forget
I-I’ll never let it go
Honey, I’m not your honey pie


[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Can you handle the truth? I don’t think you can
Jealous ‘cause I’m working with this female band
She wanna, consume the world and get all females banned
Always talk about marriage, I don’t see those plans
And yes, I cheated once and so did you
You let your girl eat you out like a bowl of soup
And how you didn't include master bruce?
Two girls in the nude I couldn’t wait to intrude
I couldn’t wait to penetrate the both of you two
You probably been scared I wasn’t noticing you
Scared I’d be occupied with your friend, my nose in the boobs
But, we ain't play that game cause we know you probably would lose
Honey pie, don’t front like you goodie-two-shoes
You ain’t got no money, how’d you get those shoes?
I put the clothes on your back, this the thanks I get?
Is this April? This must be a prank or some shit
[Pre-Hook: Haim]
He’s in her heart, on the floor thinkin' that I’ll never know
I’ll be up going through crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head seein' all the words I’ve said
Honey, honey I am never coming home again

I wanted an honest man
I thought I found one of them
Stood by him every time I was scared
I was blind, wasn't I?
Thought he was a modest man
Who could put me back together again
Tried so hard to read his mind through his eyes
I was scared, I was blind

[Chorus]
But I found it in silence, finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I found it in silence, finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me

[Verse 2]
Three fingers on the edge
You always talked me down in the end
Made me think you were right all this time
Not this time, not this time
Both of us holding back
But you were the most guilty of that
Someone else on your mind all this time
I was right, wasn't I?

You told me not to walk away
You told me not to walk, walk, walk, walk, walk

There's no turning back, I know what's good for me

There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
Found it in silence (Found it in silence), finally see (Finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me

[Bridge]
It was always for the better
And I guess I should've known
The truth is it's your issue
I know I need to let it go
And though I have found happiness
In a life that's truly mine
You'd think I could just laugh it off
But it gets me every time
[Refrain]
Found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence

You think you know about me, well, I know me better
I'm not the girl who waits around just to be walked all over
I never tread the line, I never fell and I never lied
But I never thought that I could be the one to open my eyes

[Chorus]
I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I
Could never stay the same
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to where I belong
So now
I'm going home
Take me home, just take me home
Take me home

[Post-Chorus]
Home is a symphony and it's bittersweet when it's callin' me
Just another river deep, flowing to an ocean
I know that I may never know; the future, unpredictable
A hundred choices led me here, lessons learned with every tear
They take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home

And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it

We were thinking we were wise
There was a moment, you and I
We saw it stretch across our lives
Thinking we could make it if we tried
And now this car won't drive this road
There are some things I should've known
There are some things on my mind
But I won't pick up the line

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't have the heart to admit
I don't wanna finish what we started
I think you could be an honest man
But I'm a woman who's just too guarded
We know it's a big mistake
Like the other ones we made
Nothing left to do but let it lie
Let's not wait till water's running dry

[Verse 2]
Now I don't wanna compromise
'Cause, baby, both of us have tried
You know it hurts me letting go
It hurts me more than I can show

I never wanna see you again with the beating of my heart witness

Oh, I'm getting back to everything I had
Before you came around
You fucked me up, what am I do to now?
But in my mind I keep seeing you, seeing me
And how good we used to be
Used to be, used to be, used to be, used to be
I keep seeing it, seeing me
And how good we used to be
Used to be, used to be, used to be, used to be

Oh no, oh no
Woke up this morning
Thought I was still dreaming
Album of the year nominees
Seems like Jews are now mainstreaming
News Alert: Oh god what happened?
Wish I was still sleeping
Spent too many days this year
On Tik Tok, drinking wine, and weeping
90 degrees and stores all shut
Biden/Harris, no utter disasters
December 10th, Oh Hanukkah!
No time to Netflix chess grandmasters
So TV off, tried to escape
But remembered our good ol' ""Stay in place!""
Bypassed Amazon and Instagram
To locally sourced millennial Judaica

[Verse 2]
Zoom'd my sis and parents up
Mom said my skin looked oily
Changed the subject to the fact
That mom's shirt looks just like a doily
My menorah's lost, I'm breaking out
Depressed from having zero sex
Dad interjects, latkes a mess
The Cuisinart stopped working

[Verse 3]
Tried to write a Hanukkah song
For the year that's been unending
Called our friend who wrote ""Slave Play""
And another one who loves Anime (Jeremy said!)
Reface app, Insta thirst traps
WAP-ing in the mirror
Buy my play it's called ""Slave Play""
Wait are we in a Tony campaign?
It's Hanukkah! During COVID-19
What the hell does anything mean?
I stay awake way too late
'Cause Neo-Nazis made Pizzagate
And that for three whole months
In major cities in every state
No food is left on the street
Each other is all that rats ate
[Verse 4]
Seven o'clock, I hear a ring
Look over at my door
See a masked delivery man
Holding four menorahs
One from mom, one from sis
Another from sis, and another from
Our secret fourth sis
Our little Frankie Jonas
To my surprise hers is the best
So simple and unadorned
Burst into tears and began to cry
2020 has been full of lies
But even its most hellish months
Have offered sweet surprises:
Bye bye Trump
We saved Forrest Gump
Zendaya got her trophy
We can't go to restaurants but
My boyfriend made Macaroni!

Into the moment like I'm standing at the edge, I know
That no one's gonna turn me around
Just one more step, I could let go

Oh, and in the middle
I hear the voices and they're calling for me now, I know
That nothing's gonna wake me now
'Cause I'm a slave to the sound

And they're calling
Don't stop, no I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

Oh, but now I'm falling, falling, falling

Danielle: Well this song is really special like, really special because I think we were in the studio and kind of, you know, having, trying to finish The Wire like we said and just like trying to finish these songs that we had had, that we have had for years. We were like ""I really just wanna just get my mind off of it and just try something new."" And we kind of came up with some chords and like, kind of made like a drum track. Cuz we, for this record, we were really inspired by just drums. You know, writing to drum beats that we make. We kinda wrote the song in like a couple of hours and we were like ""This is kinda good""

Alana: Yeah

Take me back, t-t-take me back

3296961,HAIM,HAIM on The Wire,"2 ContributorsHAIM on The Wire LyricsAlana: I wish that we had like a video tape of every time we recorded The Wire.  It would be like the craziest compilation of stress.

Este: It would also be the saddest, it would be like the saddest documentary ever.

Danielle: It would just be us just crying after every attempt.

Alana: The Wire

Este: It would basically be The Wire video, but the roles were reversed. We would just be crying the whole time.

Alana: Yeah. Um, The Wire we recorded over seven times.

Este: Seven, eight times.

Alana: Yeah. Every-

Este: Every time it was just, just wasn't-

Danielle: Wasn't poppin'

Alana: Yeah. It was not poppin. Just, no one could really capture what we wanted. And it was just, and it's hard like by attempt number four you're kind of like ""What else can I do?""

Danielle: I think where the problems lies that its like very major and it's a shuffle and you know-

Alana: A lot going on
Danielle: Kind of hard to make it. There's one mine record in it and it's just kind of hard to make it what we wanted it to be for some reason. But, I think we kind of struck a good balance of it being a little quirky, a little fun, but also like, have some cool production elements and I think, I think we were like, by the time we had this version, which took us like a month, we were like ""You know what? This is it.""

Alana: ""This is it. Michael Jackson.""

Este: Yeah yeah.

Danielle: This is it, Michael Jackson?

Alana and Este: Yeah as in the movie!

Danielle: Oh okay!

Alana: This is it, Michael Jackson. I'm just gonna start saying random words.

Danielle: This is it Michael Jackson!

Alana: No, but yeah like at that point we were just like ""Put it out"". That's when we know when we're done with a song, when we're just like ""Put it out.""

Danielle: We can't listen to it anymore.

Alana: We got to kind of like, mess with the composition of the song and put new things in and take some things out. And-

Danielle: Yeah

Alana: It's, it was, it was a struggle- let me tell you. But it was, it was a good struggle. Now that it's out I'm kinda, now it's the weirdest thing is like now hearing people like, know it because we've been playing it since 2008 and every time we play it no one would know- because no one would, because we never had anything out and now we hear people-
Danielle: Yeah it's fun to hear the people go ""Right!""

Alana: Yeah that's the only thing that they know because like the words, there's so many words and you like look into the crowd and everyone's like trying to mouth the words but it's like so fast that they can't do it. And then right comes around and it's like ""Yeah! Right!"" But, um yeah that song definitely, that was the hard- that is the hardest song we've ever recorded. I think that's gonna be the hardest song we've ever recorded, but it was a good journey and now we're here.

Alana: Recording-wise, we kind of like doing things um, we just like adding new things that you wouldn't really necessarily hear live, I think which is cool, I mean in the studio-

Danielle: I think we always had this idea- like the way that it turned out was always the idea we had behind it and that's why recording it- when we recorded it live, it just didn't feel like, um what's the word? When we recorded it just live in a room, it just felt like something was missing. And like, you know, we heard like, kind of like snaps and like claps and like, you know things that maybe I guess are a little more poppier.Embed",0,/songs/3296961,HAIM on The Wire by HAIM,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.300x300x1.png,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.1000x1000x1.png,3222672,complete,/Haim-haim-on-the-wire-annotated,,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.300x300x1.png,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.1000x1000x1.png,HAIM on The Wire,https://genius.com/Haim-haim-on-the-wire-annotated,/albums/377844,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.1000x1000x1.png,Spotify Exclusive Commentary by HAIM,377844.0,Spotify Exclusive Commentary,2013,https://genius.com/albums/Haim/Spotify-exclusive-commentary

All: Yes

Host: So the album when it started I thought that something was broken with the computer. I was like ""Is there like a movie trailer thing or something like that? Is there like an advert on my youtube somewhere?"" like what's going on?

Este: That was the idea I think behind it. We wanted it to sound like the beginning of Jurassic Park, like there were velociraptors coming into your house.

Alana: Like you know the scene where there's like a glass of water and it just ripples? Yeah that's what we wanted the beginning to sound like.

Este: Because the T-rex is coming. That's what we wanted it to sound like.

Host: Was it hard like deciding which track to put first as the opener?

Danielle: It was, just cuz we didn't know like what kind of vibe. And then it just, I think we were kind of having a listening party and were like ""Why don't we just start with falling?"" because it kind of puts you in a mood I think.

Alana: Yeah, start the party- track one

Este: Something you can count on, you know? Familiarity.

Alana: This was kind of like the first song we knew for a fact was gonna be on the record. So like when I think about Falling, I like think about like a year ago when we started.
Danielle: I think my favorite part was when we figured out the outro. Este just kind of went into the booth and we were like ""Riff, Este! Just go!"" and she just like she like vocal jammed for like-

Este: Yeah, I'm the vocal jam lap dog. They do they do things, they tell me to do things and I do them.

Alana: ""Go in there, Este. You go."" *imitates whip cracking sounds* ""Get in there"" *imitates more whip cracking sounds* ""Get in the vocal booth""

Danielle: And I remember coming, she came up with this like chant at the chant at the end the ""never look back never give up"" and we were like wait that's like really good and then just like we ended the-

Alana: And Este walked out and brushed her shoulders off

Into the moment like I'm standing at the edge, I know
That no one's gonna turn me around
Just one more step, I could let go

Oh, and in the middle
I hear the voices and they're calling for me now, I know
That nothing's gonna wake me now
'Cause I'm a slave to the sound

And they're calling
Don't stop, no I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

Oh, but now I'm falling, falling, falling

Hey you!
Remember me? Remember love?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time, you took it all
You tried to see
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me
It isn't fair, to have your way
To try and get up and go and na na na na now can't you see
It isn't fair to have your way
But I'm trying to get your attention and I need you to know that

[Pre-Chorus: Haim]
Hey you! Hey you!

I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, now I know, I know know know

3297661,HAIM,HAIM on My Song 5,"2 ContributorsHAIM on My Song 5 LyricsHost: My Song 5 is a little bit of a surprise when you listen to the record. It's like ""Is that you? Is that really you? It's not what I was expecting but I like it.""

Danielle: That song, I mean just the title 'My Song 5', its the demo. It's whenever you open a Garageband track, you know, it gives you a title already and the first title is 'My Song 1' and then once you use that up-

Este: It goes: 2, 3, 4, 5

Danielle: The next, My Song 2, My- Unless you name it something, and for me, whenever I'm making, we're making or just writing and not making any specific idea or we don't have an idea for a lyric it kinda. Like, it's weird to kind of name a song before you even create anything.

All: Yeah.

Danielle: So, once we got to My Song 5, we kind of created this weird melody with these weird drums and just kind of brainstormed a bunch of different ideas on this one session. And I remember bringing it to Ariel and I was like ""There's something to this, I don't know what but there's all these kind of random parts but I think they can work together."" And we worked on it and it just always stayed My Song 5. We never changed-

Alana: Everyone was like ""What is My Song 5's name?"" and we were like ""My Song 5.""

Danielle: We were like we don't know- it just always felt that it should just be called that, just because it is- There's so many different parts and it kind of just sounds like a demo and we used a lot of the sounds from the demo. Like, there's a part where I say ""Honey I'm not you're honey pie."" and that's literally me in my living room on Garageband with like a weird CD like stuck in- like you can hear like the weird humming from the CD, like my stuck CD in my laptop. Like, you know, we used a lot of the Garageband sounds on that. It just seemed like we should keep it My Song 5.

Este: That was a fun one to record too.

Alana and Danielle: Yeah.

Danielle: Just cuz we were, we wanted to keep the demo-ish quality of it but kind of amp it up.Embed",0,/songs/3297661,HAIM on My Song 5 by HAIM,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.300x300x1.png,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.1000x1000x1.png,3222672,complete,/Haim-haim-on-my-song-5-annotated,,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.300x300x1.png,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.1000x1000x1.png,HAIM on My Song 5,https://genius.com/Haim-haim-on-my-song-5-annotated,/albums/377844,https://images.genius.com/27d84382a2971cbffbe6f29657757ec2.1000x1000x1.png,Spotify Exclusive Commentary by HAIM,377844.0,Spotify Exclusive Commentary,2013,https://genius.com/albums/Haim/Spotify-exclusive-commentary
3296925,HAIM,HAIM on Forever,"2 ContributorsHAIM on Forever LyricsHost: What about Forever? Cuz you rerecorded that from since the EP.

Danielle: We didn't actually. We tried to, that was like a song that we kind of went in saying like ""We should, you know, for the record like redo it"" and we tried and like the kind of magic was just already there in the first one and we didn't really wanna mess with it. It got remixed because-

Host: Yeah. it definitely sounds slightly different.

Danielle: Yeah. And I think, you know, there's some new vocals on it because when we first recorded it, we recorded it in like, a closet essentially. You know, with like a little live room-

Danielle: So all the drums are just stored in- So we kind of, we messed with it, but it was one of those songs where we were like ""You know what? We can't recreate what we made, you know, two years ago""

Danielle: Forever is probably one of our most kind of important songs, I think, cuz it kind of started everything for us so-

Alana: It was the most important song that almost got thrown away.

Este and Danielle: Yeah.

Este: That we almost didn't record.

Alana: Yeah, we almost didn't record it. It was, we had been playing forever for forever.

Everyone: *laughs*

Alana: No, for I think like two years or something. And like, every time we played it, it was like really different, it was like half time.

Danielle: It was slower.
Alana: It was really slower- it was really slower. It was way slower.

Danielle: I remember coming to the studio with a kick and a snare and a hi hat, that's all we had. And he had this little live room, and again, like there was just, we set up a couple mics and I just like played for five minutes. And then we just like blew it out, we just like distorted the sh*t out of the drums because the mics were so bad. And like I think we added like a sub kick like just triggered one and then like we like kind of had this like upbeat track.  And I was like ""Wait maybe this could work?"" and it totally did. Like we literally for like four days just kind of messed with it and it was the most excited thing that we recorded just because we weren't really thinking about it And we-

Alana: Yeah, Forever was the first song that we could play in our car for more than three seconds.

Danielle: Yeah, before when we would record stuff, we'd like play it in the car and like we couldn't listen to it, cuz we get just like kind of embarrassed about it like ""wait, this is us and it's weird."" But, Forever was the first thing we were like ""wait I wanna play this""

Este: Yeah. I think we just wanted a residency. That was like, that was our goal.

Alana: Yeah that was like the big-

Danielle: In LA there's like-

Este: Because you know the Monday nights residencies in LA. Like, every venue basically on the Eastside opens its doors for free and there's like one band that plays the whole month and then they have like openers.  So we would always do like, we would be like the openers for people that had the residencies.  So we would be like ""One day. One day we'll have our own.""

Alana: ""One day we'll have a residency at The Echo."" and that still didn't even happen. We like released the Forever EP and were like ""Can we have a residency?"" and they're like-

All: ""No.""

Alana: And we were like ""Cool. Thanks.""

Danielle: Which is like, yeah it was like our first time in an actual really nice recording studio and-

Este: An actual recording studio. It's like the dopest room ever. Prince did Purple Rain in there.

Yo, lets make this shit legendary
Gotta give you something nice

Go go go go get out get out of my memory
No no no not tonight I don't have the energy
Go go go go get out get out of my memory
No no no not tonight no not tonight oh not tonight

Forever we tried to make it right
Together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye

Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I (uh)
No I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

(Pete B)
Yo scholarship she just won a free ride
Since she moved in she can't escape the east side
In the mean time she grind tryna make it out to bean town
Scratches on my back mistake her for a feline
Rewind back to the day we first met
Thought I was over, way in over my head
Mistake me for a lame so she played me to the left
Said the word forever but I knew what she meant
Just that forever, right before forevers' next
Got myself a main now I'm focused on the checks
Got word play that compares to the best
They tell me ""yo that's the way it goes""
Tryna make it to a Rolls from a Ford Tempo
Steady workin mental
Eying a reflection overly potential (fuck)
Fuck your restrictions, nowhere that I can't go
Whoa!

3297710,HAIM,HAIM on Running If You Call My Name,"2 ContributorsHAIM on Running If You Call My Name LyricsHost: Tell me about Running If You Call My Name and why did you want it to be the last song on the album? The kind of goodbye?

Danielle: Um, it was, that was actually the last song that we wrote, um, when we were recording the record. We never really wrote a lot of songs on the piano, well you play piano, Alana plays piano.

Alana: Yeah.

Danielle: Um, but we never really, I don't know why we never really wrote on piano but this is kind of like the first one where we had this piano line and it just felt kind of like a closer for some reason.

Alana: We put like blood, sweat, and tears into the last song. It was kind of like the end of this long, long recording process and we had such a crazy year this year and um, with Running If You Call My Name every time we played it it kind of just felt like you could- at least for us, every time I listen to it I can like feel all like the craziness that we went through and all the fun times and all like the really stressful times we went through. It's just like this big release every time I hear it and it just felt like such a good closer cuz it was the end for us. You can, I think you can kind of tell when you listen to it that it like, we put everything that we had into that song and it just seemed like a really nice way to end since it was the end for us on this record. That was it, just kind of like a release. It was, and we had written that like at the very, very end, it was like the last thing. We were just like ""This is it, this is the last ounce of creative juice we have. This here.""

Este: Yeah.

Alana: And that's just what happened. And I love, every time I listen to this song it's just so, I just love, I could listen to it over and over and over again cuz it's just, it's so crazy to hear what we came up with on that one. Touring really inspired us this year cuz all we want, I mean we've been a band for six years, almost seven years and all we wanted to do was tour and we could never do that cuz we couldn't get out of LA, we couldn't, you know we didn't have money, we couldn't do things. This year we got asked to be on so many amazing tours and meet so many amazing people and we would come back from tours, we'd have like a month and we'd just be so inspired. I think touring just, really inspired us the most out of everything, I think you can hear it in the new songs.

Alana: Yeah, it's just been the best year. I mean, we literally like we've played every kind of venue. We've played every living room, every parking lot. Every like, every time we would play at 6:30. We'd play before the opener of the opener of the opener.

Este: We'd play as, as people were coming in we'd be like ""Thank you for coming to the show, here's another song. Thank- yes, ten, ten dollars at the door.""

Alana: Yeah, yeah. We had like a hat out.

Este: Yeah, basically busking.

Alana: And so, yeah I mean, we're just really grateful and super lucky that we get to do this. And that we even, you know, can put out a record cuz that's all we wanted to do. I mean, we've played live so many times and all we wanted to do was record our debut record.

Este: I just like can't believe it's coming out. I don't think it's actually hit me that our record is actually going to be on a shelf.
Alana: Yeah.

Host: Have you had, held a copy yet? Of the CD?

Alana and Este: No

Este: That will be weird.

Alana: I'm gonna, I think it's just gonna like drop out of my, it's gonna like liquidate in my hands.

Este: It's like protecting it like it's a baby.

Alana: ""Don't drop the CD!""

Este: ""Don't drop the record!""

Alana: I don't even know-

Este: ""Cradle its head, Este!""

Alana: I don't know what's gonna happen when I hold it for the first time. It's gonna be crazy.

Este: It's gonna be fun. I also can't wait to go to Amoeba Records. Like, it's like, you know you go to your hometown record store. I just can't wait to do that, go to Amoeba-

Alana: Yeah.
Este: See it on the shelf. It's gonna be crazy.

Alana: But yeah that's, that's the record. Which is pretty crazy.

All: Yeah.

Alana: In London. Yeah that was the only song that we wrote fully in the UK, which was fun cuz I think we were here for like two weeks, just kind of, cuz we had, we had always been here for work and we had never been like here just screw around and have fun. We had met so many people that were like ""Have you met Jessie Ware?"" and we were like ""No"" and they were like ""Just wait. Cuz you're gonna love Jessie Ware."" and we were like ""We wanna meet her!"" and randomly one night she was in the studio-

Este: With our friend

Alana: With our friend Kid Harpoon and he was like ""Come to the studio, Jessie's here."" Cuz like, she was always so busy, I mean she's Jessie Ware she's amazing. And we came to the studio and like bum rushed the session and it literally took us three seconds to be like ""Okay we're best friends.""

Este: Yeah, yeah.

Alana: Like we took, we said like one sentence. We were just like ""Hey"" and she was like ""Hey"" and we were like ""Okay we just became best friends.""

Este: Yeah, yeah.

Alana: She's like the most amazing person and we kind of like grew up the same way and we had the best time and then Tom was like ""We actually do have to work"" and we were all like ""We're tired we had so much-

Alana and Este: ""Fun""

Alana: ""Like we don't wanna do anything."" and he was like ""Let's just go and see what happens in the studio. Like, we'll do something as a joke and sent it to someone so it kind of looks like we've done something today"" and we were like ""Okay"" and we went back to the studio and Danielle and Tom kind of did this like crazy drum track and we put some chords to it and then literally like gave Este the mic and were like ""Do your thing dude. Do you boo"" and the first thing she sang was-

Danielle and Alana: The verse

Alana: Like the first try was ""Do do do do do"" like she just kept doing that and we were just like ""Whoa, okay that's done. Like, verse done. Cool. Next"" and then um Jessie was kind of chanting ""Days are gone"" or like ""do do do do"" and um like once we had like the structure down we were like ""Alright, words."" Like it was literally just like okay-
Danielle: Like in an hour

Alana: Everything just kind of like, it was like the weirdest thing it just happened so fast. And we had Days Are Gone done in an hour like literally an hour like I'm not being like ""It's an hour but it really took seven hours"" like it really took an hour-

Este: Cuz we were so tired it was like-

Danielle: It was just like stream on consciousness, just like-

Este: Came out.

Danielle: Goin' for it.

Alana: And-

Danielle: And again like, we don't really write with a lot of other people but I think we were just so taken by Jessie and just excited to be kinda hanging out with someone that was so cool.

Este: She has the best energy.

Danielle: And she was the best cheerleader too, you know? It's like when we're, when the three of us are just like writing its kind of like-

Alana: ""Is that good? I don't know, we'll come back.""

Danielle: ""Is that good? I don't know yeah"" and Jessie was just like ""Yes that's good! Keep going keep going!""

Alana: ""Keep going! Keep going!"" and we're like ""Okay! We're going! Let's do it!
Este: ""Go with it! Keep going!""

Alana: ""We got it! Okay!""

Este: Yeah, she's like gatorade. She literally is like audible gatorade. Keeps you going, it was awesome.

3297689,HAIM,HAIM on Go Slow,"2 ContributorsHAIM on Go Slow LyricsAlana: Go Slow-

Host: is another oldie.

Alana: Um, yeah Go Slow was the last song on the Forever EP and with that song, um we had just the track for like a year before we put any melody on it. We just had the guitar line, the ""do do do do do do do do."" And um, we always liked adding things to it. We had this like, full demo and just, it didn't have a melody on it and we wrote a full song over it. And kinda sounded like it didn't really seem right and it was like done. Everything, there was like a verse, chorus, everything. And then, finally we were just like ""We need to just rewrite it."" And we never really did that. It's really hard to have a full song and kind of be set in your ways and to realize like okay, it's not right. You have to rewrite the whole thing cuz you just keep playing the same melody in your head so it's kind of hard to get away from it. We finally just sat down and like erased everything and started over and went with like a more simpler melody-

Este: Yeah.

Alana: We were just like ""It needs to have space"" because the guitar line needs to have room. And then Go Slow kinda came about and that's what happened.

Host: Is it also the original recordings from the EP just remixed?

Danielle and Alana: Yeah.

Danielle: That was one of the ones that we tried to kind of mess with-

Alana: Rerecord.

Danielle: And rerecord.

Alana: It wasn't The Wire hard.

Este: Nothing, nothing is The Wire hard.

Alana: It was-

Danielle: We kinda just wanted to keep the live element and we played it live in the- that was one that we just kind of like played live in the studio and-

Alana: I got to play this dope organ, it was like this huge organ. I remember kind of screwing up on purpose cuz I just kept, I wanted to keep recording it cuz it just sounded so cool. Ariel was like-

Este: ""Alana!""

Alana: ""Play it right this time!""

Este: I was playing the um-

Host: ""Why did the Don't Save Me album take so long, Haim?"" ""Alana with her organ!""
Este: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Alana: ""Alana took five years to record her organ part!"" Um, but yeah that song was really fun, at least really fun to record for me because I got to, it was kind of like I got to try out so many keyboards and organs for the background part. But, um yeah with that song it was just really important for us to keep it live and not really screw it up, just screw around with it cuz I think it's just really straight forward.

Host: It's the drums part you play live as well?

Danielle: Yeah, it's not on the record because we feel like-

Alana: Well we just like, we keep, we like to change up the drum part every time we play it and we didn't really want to put it, I'd rather it be a surprise every time and not just like on the record. It's kind of like yeah just always, that part always evolves. And so yeah it's just not, it's more of a live surprise than a record surprise.

Host: That's the great thing about having an album and then going to see a band live. If it sounded exactly the same, you could just stay at home

All: Yeah.

Host: Just turn it up a bit louder. Save yourself twenty quid or whatever.

Alana: Yeah.

Este: Right?

Host: But you get to be more, you know, experimental in the studio, put in different sounds, turn the songs into something else and then when you play them live, you can do the same thing in a different way.

Alana: Exactly.

Host: I think that's the good thing about your album, is that it-

2119408,HAIM,The wire - farhot remix,"2 ContributorsThe wire - farhot remix Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know I""m bad at communication
It""s hardest thing for me to do
And they say it's the most important part
That relationships go through
And I gave it all away just, so I could say that well
I know I know I know I know
That you""re gonna be okay anyway
You know there""s no rhyme or reason for the way you turned out to be
I didn""t go and try to change my mind, not intentionally
I know it""s hard to hear me say it, but I can""t bear to stay and
I just know I know I know I know
That you""re gonna be okay anyway

[Bridge]
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don""t let your mind retire
But I just couldn""t take it
I tried hard not to fake it but
I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

[Hook] (x2)
It felt right
It felt right
But I fumbled it when it
Came down to the wire

Does your imagination make you what you want it to be
Because I""m sorry now for what I did
But it came naturally
And I gave it all away just so I could say that
I know I know I know I know
That you gonna be okay anyway
Well, I try to keep myself together
After all the opportunities
Try to stay true to you and try to do
What you wanted from me
And I gave it all away just to hear you say that
Well I know I know I know I know
That you gonna be okay anyway

[Bridge]

[Hook]
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your heart retire

5140157,HAIM,Want You Back - Recorded at Spotify Studios NYC,"1 ContributorWant You Back - Recorded at Spotify Studios NYC Lyrics[Verse 1: Danielle]
Some things are long forgotten
Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart

[Verse 2: Danielle & Este & Alana]
I said we were opposite lovers
Said it from the beginning
You kept trying to prove me wrong
Said you'd always see it through
And I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart

[Chorus]
But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

I know it's hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don't take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself

[Verse 4: Danielle & Este & Alana]
And I had a fear of forgiveness
Said it from the beginning
I was too proud to say I was wrong
Said you'd always see me through
All that time is gone, no more fearing control
I'm ready for the both of us now

[Chorus]
So just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
(Just know that I want you back, baby)
[Bridge: Alana]
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

That nothing's gonna wake me now
'Cause I'm a slave to the sound

And they're calling

Remember me? Remember love?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time, you took it all
You tried to see
You tried to bring yourself up
Without involving me
It isn't fair, to have your way
To try and get up and go now can't you see
It isn't fair to have your way
But I'm trying to get your attention
I need you to know that
Hey you, hey you
Can't you make this sane
I know, I know, I know, you ain't the one to play the game
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, now I know, I know I know I know
Forever we tried to make it right
But together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right
I don't wanna turn around
So come on baby
Come on and try to let it out
Let go
We're still the same
So come on baby
Trigger the sound, figure it out
Let's get back to were we started out
Hey you, hey you
Can't you make this sane

You think you know about me, well, I know me better
I'm not the girl who waits around just to be walked all over
I never tread the line, I never fell and I never lied
But I never thought that I could be the one to open my eyes

[Chorus]
I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I
Could never stay the same
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to wherе I belong
So now
I'm going home
Take mе home, just take me home
Take me home

[Post-Chorus]
Home is a symphony and it's bittersweet when it's callin' me
Just another river deep, flowing to an ocean
I know that I may never know; the future, unpredictable
A hundred choices led me here, lessons learned with every tear
They take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
Hold it inside my heart
Just take me home

Take me home

[Bridge]
Looking back on my life
The past is a mirror
I've left and come back
But what am I closer to? (I know that)
But what am I closer to? (We'll be looking back one day)
What am I closer to? (I hope that we)
What am I closer to? (Will never be the same)

[Chorus]
I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I (I trust that I)
I could never stay the same (I could never stay the same)
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to where I belong
So now (Now, now)

Home is a symphony and it's bittersweet when it's callin' me
