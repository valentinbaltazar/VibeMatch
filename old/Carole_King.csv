When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

[Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

[Verse 2]
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old North wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door

Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, a-running, yeah, yeah-eah

Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing, or maybe we just stopped trying

[Chorus]
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no, no, no (No, no, no, no)

[Verse 2]
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool

So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
How I wish I could
But you're so far away

Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold

[Verse 2]
Once amid the soft silver sadness in the sky
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors, yellow-green on either side

[Bridge]
He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go
Once he reached for something golden hanging from a tree
And his hand came down empty

[Verse 3]
Soon within my tapestry along the rutted road
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well

[Verse 4]
As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure gray and ghostly beneath a flowing beard
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black
Now my tapestry's unraveling, he's come to take me back
He's come to take me backYou might also like6Embed",11,/songs/149937,Tapestry by Carole King,https://images.genius.com/8a2a987c2ddf085206aa95d32175906b.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/8a2a987c2ddf085206aa95d32175906b.640x640x1.jpg,1553,complete,/Carole-king-tapestry-lyrics,6,https://images.genius.com/8a2a987c2ddf085206aa95d32175906b.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/8a2a987c2ddf085206aa95d32175906b.640x640x1.jpg,Tapestry,https://genius.com/Carole-king-tapestry-lyrics,/albums/33366,https://images.genius.com/8a2a987c2ddf085206aa95d32175906b.640x640x1.jpg,Tapestry by Carole King,33366.0,Tapestry,"February 10, 1971",https://genius.com/albums/Carole-king/Tapestry

He can sing you into paradise
Or bring you to your knees
It's a gospel kind of feelin'
A touch of Georgia slide
A song of pure revival
And a style that's sanctified

Make my pain the same as yours
With every change you play

When the jazzman's signifyin'
And the band is windin' low
It's the late night side of mornin'
In the darkness of his soul
He can fill a room with sadness
As he fills his horn with tears
He can cry like a fallen angel
When risin' time is near

I will ride a crocodile (I will ride a crocodile)
Down the chicken soup-y Nile
Paddle once, paddle twice
Paddle chicken soup with rice

In October I'll be host
To witches, goblins and a ghost
I'll serve them chicken soup on toast
Whoopy once, whoopy twice
Whoopy chicken soup with rice

In November's gusty gale I will flop my flippy tail
And spout hot soup—I'll be a whale!
Spouting once, spouting twice
Spouting chicken soup with rice

In December I will be
A baubled, bangled Christmas tree

With soup bowls draped all over me
Merry once, merry twice
Merry chicken soup with

For eating chicken soup

Oh, I'd rather go and journey where the
Diamond crescent's flowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
That break the light up into colors
That no one knows the names of

[Verse 2]
And when it's time I'll go and wait
Beside the legendary fountain
'Til I see your form reflected
In its clear and jeweled waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another

[Verse 3]
And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they've created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
And I know at that moment
As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive
Beneath the white cascading water

1260065,Carole King,Pierre,"4 ContributorsPierre LyricsPrologue:
There was once a boy named Pierre
Who only would say, I don't care!
Read his story, my friend, for you'll find
At the end that a suitable
Moral lies there

(Chapter I)

One day his mother said
When Pierre climbed out of bed
-Good morning, darling boy, you are my only joy
Pierre said-I don't care!
-What would you like to eat?
-I don't care!
-Some lovely cream of wheat?
-I don't care!
-Don't sit backwards in your chair
-I don't care!
-Or pour syrup on your hair
-I don't care!
-You are acting like a clown
-I don't care!
-And we have to go to town
-I don't care!
-Don't you want to come, my dear?
-I don't care!
-Would you rather stay right here?
-I don't care!
So his mother left him there
You might also like(Chapter II)

His father said-Get off your head
Or I will march you up to bed!
Pierre said-I don't care!
-I would think that you could see--
-I don't care!
-Your head is where your feet should be!
-I don't care!
-If you keep standing upside down--
-I don't care!
-We'll never get to town
-I don't care!
-If only you would say, I care
-I don't care!
-I'd let you fold the folding chair
-I don't care!
So his parents left him there
They didn't take him anywhere

(Chapter III)

Now as the night began to fall
A hungry lion paid a call
He looked Pierre right in the eye
And asked him if he'd like to die
Pierre said-I don't care!
-I can eat you, don't you see?
-I don't care!
-And you will be inside of me
-I don't care!
-Then you will never have to bother--
-I don't care!
-With a mother and a father
-I don't care!
-Is that all you have to say?
-I don't care!
-Then I'll eat you, if I may
-I don't care!
So the lion ate Pierre
(Chapter IV)

Arriving home at six o'clock
His parents had a dreadful shock!
They found the lion sick in bed and cried
-Pierre is surely dead!
They pulled the lion by the hair
They hit him with the folding chair
His mother asked-Where is Pierre?
The lion answered-I don't care!
His father said-Pierre's in there!

(Chapter V)

They rushed the lion into town
The doctor shook him up and down
And when the lion gave a roar
Pierre fell out upon the floor
He rubbed his eyes and scratched his head
And laughed because he wasn't dead
His mother cried and held him tight
His father asked-Are you allright?
Pierre said-I am feeling fine
Please take me home, it's half past nine

The lion said-If you would care
To climb on me, I'll take you there
Then everyone looked at Pierre
Who shouted-Yes, indeed, I care!

And those strangers' cold perceptions
They've killed his confidence

[Chorus]

She sails away upon a sea of song

She serenades his lonely, lonely life along
When his tired voice is broken
His golden hope is gone
She makes a lost soul's simple longing
Somehow not so wrong

By the thought of his success
Those spotlight shadows, how they lured him (How they lured him)
And took him like all the rest

No, it don't seem quite the same
He needs to hear a tender word
Won't you sing him home again?

On the first day in August
I wanna wake up by your side
After sleeping with you
On the last night in July
In the morning
We'll catch the sun rising
And we'll chase it from the mountains
To the bottom of the sea

[Bridge]
When the day is over
And the night air comes to chill us
You'll build a fire
And we'll watch the flames dancing

[Verse 2]
You'll fall asleep
With your arm around my shoulder
And nothing will come between us

Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal
Just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down

The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
(Exciting, exciting, ooh)
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone
And the path is unknown
And there is no easy way down

[Bridge]
No, it isn't very easy (No easy way down)
When you're left on your own (No easy way down)
No, it isn't very easy
When each road you take
Is one more mistake
And there's no one to break your fall (Your fall)
And lead you back home

[Verse 3]
We all like to climb to the heights, I know
Where our fantasy world can be found

As I bask in the glow of a just-lit fire
Feeling the warmth as the flame grows higher
I think it's true that nothing is really new under the sun
Watching a new love grow from old love's embers
Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone?

[Chorus]
Only love is real (Only love is real)
Everything else illusion (Only love)
Adding to the confusion of
The way we connive at being alive
Tracing a line 'til we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Only love is real
Only love is real

[Verse 2]
Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I wish I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me

If I am the question
You are the answer
If you are the music
I am the dancer
Through all of the madness
And all of the sadness
Of day-to-day living
We gotta keep giving

[Chorus]

Me to you
Pure and simple
Sweet and true

You to me
Sending the love so it's
Spreading out endlessly

[Verse 2]
Now there are those moments
When life loses meaning
And we lose our faith in
The dreams we've been dreaming
When people seem mindless
And plain human kindness
Appears to be dying
We gotta keep trying

You touched my shoulder, and I turned around
Here we are, the hardest part is done
And all that's left is loving you forever

My heart stopped beating, I couldn't let it show
You were as unexpected, as roses in the snow
Just like that, I knew you were the one
Now all that's left is loving you forever

In this world, we're lucky if we find
A spark that sparks one time
Like when we are together

And in that moment, it happened so fast
My prayers were answered, I found love at last

From her throne she looks down at the clowns
Who think youth can be found in a fountain
High on the wings of her rhythms
She will smile at the guys who come on with their eyes
But she'll never dance with them

[Chorus]
And in smoke-filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around
The Snow Queen

[Verse 2]
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you will soon bite the dust
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a loser
But in mid-air you'll be hung while you trip on your tongue
And it'll only amuse her

Caught in the icy stare of

How the time goes by
And I know I belong here
Yes, I know, though I don't know why
Riding along with a friend of mine
Got enough space, got enough time
Pieces of fruit and glasses of wine
And love comes in in the summertime
And I don't wanna lose you

Today our dear friend
Chicken soup
This very ordinary day
Boiled up a pot of
Chicken soup
And swallowed it away

[Chorus]
A-lack! A-day!
O woe! Oy vey!
He swallowed it away!
Now listen to what I'm gonna say

[Verse 2]
A little bone, a bitty thing
No bigger than my pinky—
He swallowed hot
From out that pot
In quicker than a winky

[Bridge]
He gulped that soup
Let out a whoop!
And fell down croaking
On the stoop
And he choked!
And he sagged!
And he smothered!
And he gagged!
And he let out a scream!
And he let out a moan!

'Cause he died

Don't it seem like time goes on
And here we are still carrying on
Reaching out for one another
Like a telephone call from an old friend or a brother
And you are there to share this song in the making
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone

[Verse 2]
I know how alone you are
When it's so hard to be so far
From the one who means the most to you
When you would so much rather have them close to you
I hope you know you haven't been forsaken
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone

I'll never be what you think you see in me
If I can help you deal with what you see as real
That makes me glad to have known you

Missing you the way I do
You know I'd like to see more of you

Feeling left out and so alone
But now I feel so much a part of them
Because I've got a man of my own

It's never too late to fall in love again
And I know, and I know
That it's true
You treat me with so much tenderness, love and respect
And I just love everything that you do

When I needed the comfort of a strong man's arms
You chased away my blues
Remember the first time when we made love
Brothers and sisters, have you heard the news

It's never too late to fall in love again
It don't pay, it don't pay
To sit there remembering when
No matter how much pain and heartache you've known
It's never too late

By Carole King

River wind is icy
Chills run through my bones
Tides of life are ebbing out
Between the cobblestones
The streets are on fire
With the burning sunrise
And over the water I look in vain
For love in someone's eyes

CHORUS:
Oh, City streets
The stories that they tell
Oh, City streets
They can be heaven, they can be hell

Winter colored morning
Gray and dirty brown
Reflecting the mood I'm in
Despair is all around
I long for sweet oblivion
To take me from my pain
Maybe bring me dreams of hope and faith
So, I can break this chain

Silhouettes against the light
A warm bed is waiting as they head home

Love, love makes the world
Love, love makes the world
Love, love makes the world

[Verse 1]
There was trouble in my mind tonight
Something inside didn't feel quite right
Then I saw your face in the moonlight
And I was right beside you
Don't need words that we used to use
It goes deeper than the words we choose
You can't lose—I wanna spread the news
You got a love inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Some days it's hard to know what you're feeling
I've been down that road before

[Chorus]
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round (Makes the world go round)
As long as you're a part of me
Nothing's gonna take me down, oh (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Last winter when the snowfall hit
Cold city—it was hard to commit
You were out there looking for the perfect fit
And I was right beside you
Nothing real comes overnight
You weren't sure if it felt right
But sometimes a love can move your life
If you let it guide you

Was enough to fill my cup
Now I offered all I got
And that ain't no way to live
Bein' taken by the ones
Who got the least amount to give

Once I met the devil – he was mighty slick
Tempted me with wordly goods
And said you could have your pick
But when he laid the paper on me
And he showed me where to sign

Feeling sad tonight
But everything's all right
And we'll find some other place to go
Feeling sad tonight
Oh, but everything's all right
Let's turn all our cares down low

[Verse 1]
Come on, let's go downtown
Let's take a trip back to the past
Running down the bright night
Driving a little too fast
Ooh, I'm counting on you
Sitting on a barstool
I'm a fool
Always feeling half-right and half-safe
Halfway dreaming of some safe place away from school
Ooh, I'm counting on you
Silly sometimes
I'm a fool

Feeling sad tonight
But everything's all right
We'll find some other place to go
Feeling sad tonight
Oh, but everything's all right

Which we cross
To touch each other softly
And so make up our loss
Some things take so long to learn
No matter how we try
Still we try and keep it open
And we get by

I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though, the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Simple things like horses running free
And easy acceptance of life

Simple things never compromise
All things have a rhythm I can't realize
I feel content in my freedom
And I feel my freedom is right

I never want to stop being a child
I want to see the flowers growing wild on the hillside
To see the sun rise in the morning
Sunlight growing, filling the skies

Hope flashed and went dim
When assassins just happened
To do the right people in
And love was the slogan
Coincidentally
And they told us they'd work it out

In the swing of changing times
A man cried out for his
And every politician said
He was telling us like it is
Yes, they walked down the angry streets
To have themselves a look-see
And they told us they'd work it out
Eventually

I see the choking cities
I see them tearing up this earth
I see people feelin'
That their lives have little worth
And I know that the future
Depends on you and me

But I know I've got the stuff
To be just spectacular

And visualize
Me in a cape
And fangs in my head
Loving a guy who's mostly dead

Than our lives in Transylvania
We're fabulous one day
And rotten the next

Whenever I find injustice being done
And I wonder, what am I gonna do
What can one do except to be one
Talking to two, touching three

Each of us is one--all of us are one

I go through phases when I realize
It wouldn't be wise to try and bring it down
And I wonder, what am I gonna do
What should one do except just be around
Staying alive, putting out love
Growing to five billion
Each of us is one--all of us are one

Open your heart and let the love come shining through
And you will do what you need to do
To know just where the other you is coming from
He is one--she is one
A tree is one--the earth is one--the universe is one
I am one--we are one

It just amazes me that I can be

Haywood, where have you been, tell me now
Haywood, you been on the street again, I know, I know
Haywood, that man's not your friend
Haven't you had enough of the stuff?
Oh, you know it's got to do you in

[Verse 1]
Remember John John
How mama stayed awake all night, all night
The night they brought him in
She cried and said she always knew that he was up to no good
It broke her heart the night he died
And she made me promise I'd stand by your side
And try to protect you from the evil in the neighborhood (Whoa)

[Chorus]
Haywood, where have you been, tell me now
Haywood, you been on the street again, I know, I know
Haywood, hangin' out with your so-called friends
What makes you think that you'll be the one to put it down?
Use your ears, use your eyes, just look around
Everyone's dying, everyone's going down

[Verse 2]
Just think of Valerie
She's always been so good to you
And you, you, you've never let her down
What about the life you've planned?
Well it can still come true, it's all up to you
I know it's hard to shake it
But you got to be a man and take it
I know this is no way to make it
It's not too late, it's not too late for you (Whoa)

And you look into mine

And you're a part of me
And I can hold you near

Time waits for no one, we all have to go on
But every now and then I look up an old friend
And come home to someplace I used to belong

1219236,Carole King,Time Gone By,"3 ContributorsTime Gone By LyricsTIME GONE BY
By Carole King

The rebel cry of desolation
To which we used to hearken
Echoes now in isolation
As the skies in fury darken
A thousand acts of desecration
Hundreds more continue
When y'know that you are all creation
You're gonna fight them with all that's in you

I remember time gone by
When peace and hope and dreams were high
We followed inner visions and touched the sky
Now we who still believe won't let them die

Waters dammed to overflowing
Like tears brimming over in our eyes
Sometimes it's so hard to keep on going
When promises turn to lies
Go ahead, give into confussion
And put aside your ideals too
Soon you'll see only illusion
Don't care who's hurt
As long as it's not you
You might also likeCHORUS

Soemtimes a leader emerges
And is followed for a while
Doesn't matter what he encourages
Just as long as he's got style
Young ones conceived in a passion
Of directions we thought enlighted
Grown up they follow the mood in fashion
But beneathe their bravado
You know they're frightened

And it sure ain't no conquest
It's giving and sharing
And a whole lot of caring

And I feel sorrow for the ones who
Haven't had this sensation

Ain't no life at all

Is one dead end street
Just thank you lucky stars

Now to sum up all the pages

Than you are without it

Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

[Verse 2:  Carole King & James Taylor, Carole King]
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

[Bridge: Carole King & James Taylor, Carole King, James Taylor]
Tonight with words unspoken
You'll say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken (Oh, now now)
When the night (When the night)
Meets the morning sun? (Meets the morning sun?)

When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

[Verse 2: Carole King & James Taylor]
When I come home feeling tired and beat
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I'll get away from the hustle and crowd
And all that rat race noise down in the street
[Chorus: Carole King & James Taylor, Carole King]
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Oh, let's go up on the roof

And, darling, you can share it all with me

I found a paradise that's trouble-proof
So if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two, up on the roof

Like a ghost of the future hovering dark and dreamy
You fade in and out of the mist
Do you even exist, except in my wishful thinking

I reach for you, but I can't touch you
I feel you just beyond a star
Do you know how much you are all I ever wanted
Is it too much too soon
Am I foolishly dreaming

'Cause your mama the boss says you better not cross that old Avenue P
In a jungle you are free, ta-dah

To chase mamas and papas, clippety-cloppety
Thumping their breasts and roaring, ""Get off of my property""
No one's allowed who says ""maybe"" or ""no""

So I spent the night in the local bar, but I had to drink alone

I had the midnight sun with you
Now I'm standing in the rain

The sound of her voice came without a warning
The sun was coming up, but inside my soul was storming
I guess there are some promises you just can't keep

I'm still wandering down those back streets
But with a different point of view
'Cause I lost everything I had when I bet it all on you

It's only temporary
You have to go away
But you're beautiful
And you never fail to make my day

[Verse 2]
Daughter of light
You smile and all the sadness leaves my heart
It's an easy course for sailing that you chart
But it's only temporary
You have to go away
You're too beautiful
And you know I'd never ask you to stay

[Bridge]
Riding on the beach at sunset
Dreaming of the world that waits for you
That's where my mind's eye sees you
In a world that frees you
To do anything that you wanna do
Do anything that you wanna do

Though you can only be a sometime friend
You restore my faith in love again
And that's not temporary
Even though you go away
You're too beautiful

Machine Gun Kelly was a simple man but the woman was as hard as hell
Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her run you round
Don't let the woman put you six feet in the ground, Machine Gun
I'll tell you about Katherine Kelly, tired of being such small time, now
Figured they'd kidnap a rich man's son, make it in the world of crime
Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her run you round
Don't let the woman put you six feet in the ground, Machine Gun
You'd better watch out Machine Gun Kelly, careful of what you do, now
If you keep listening to your old lady, ain't no telling what'll happen to you, now
Machine Gun
The government boys they came for Machine Gun, took the poor boy away
Stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison where he lived until his dying day
Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her put you down
Don't let a woman make you out to be a clown, Machine Gun

And I know sometimes the road isn't easy
And we've said something we'd never wished to say
Once a few rounds you loved and lost

Were pecked and pushed and hustled
Just like chickens in a coop

Here's where I learned the rules
Of Rosie's way

You're my obsession, I just can't get you out of my mind

Through my hazy confusion
I close my eyes, but your image is indelibly burned there
Seared into my memory
Now as I stand on the edge of the precipice
Looking down into the black abyss
I know I'll be lost with just one kiss

If I'd been true
I know she'd never be with you

Weekday mornings
Coffee smell in the air
After you've gone and the children have left for school
I'm alone and I think about all the plans we made
I think about all the dreams I had
And I wonder if I'm a fool

[Verse 2]

I've got the marketing done
Plenty to do but nothing to tax my mind
That's all right—it's a habit
Heaven knows I can always watch the daytime shows
And I wonder which story's mine

She loved a man she knew little about
After so many years of trying
So many years of doing without
Oh, but what's the use of crying?

We sit and I realize
You've dreamed, too, and I kind of understand
I've been with you and you need me to take care of you

Flows into our hearts and makes us feel allright

Hold on until we can get there
You know when we get there

We need each other now more than ever

Should have to walk this cold and lonely night

Down on the beach Feliz Navidad is playing
And ohhh, I oughtta miss the Christmas as I always knew
But here I am in paradise with you, just me and you, wishes come true

No crackling fire or chestnuts roasting
But we got some coconuts and rum for toasting
Don't need a snowman we'll build castles in the sand
I'm in a Christmas Paradise
You and me underneath a beach umbrella, we don't need no mistletoe at all
No need to hurry we don't have to worry there's no where else to be
But the starry sky and the Christmas lights when the sun sets on the sea

Laughing and drinking with them, thinking she's one of them
And that makes everything allright
She vaguely remembers going out in the parking lot
With the stone mason's son
Who had his way with her, then walked away when he was done
Sometimes she thinks about leaving--she tells herself, someday
You know, her daddy said she'd never amount to much
Of anything anyway

Oh, tears falling down on me
Oh, tears falling down on me
No, that ain't the way it's supposed to be
Oh, tears falling down on me
Oh, tears falling down on me

People say that's the way it is, but we gotta do what we can
Why does it have to be that way, I just don't understand
Rain falling from my eyes, rain falling from the sky
And I don't know why

A pack of jokers get their jollies beating up on a black king
There's outrage in the city for a while
But do you think it'll really change anything
Get rid of the gates, free the people
And let the games commence

I go through the motions of being with people
When deep in my soul, I wanna be where you are
I know we speak every night
But words only go so far, I know

[Verse 2]
It feels like an ocean of time we're apart
I know that I've said it before (Last night I realized)
But this time when I come home (You mean the world to me)
I will stay with you (You're the most important thing)
This time's the last time that I'm gonna go

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes and imagine me home again
It isn't so far away (Gotta hold on)
Soon I'll be back and you'll never be alone again
This time I mean to stay
(This time, this time, this time, this time, this time)

[Bridge]
I promise you this time I'll do whatever it takes
To stay right by your side
I would do anything (Anything, anything)
I would give you everything
'Cause you are everything to me

But until then
Gotta keep our emotions under control
It won't be easy to do
'Cause all I wanna do is kiss you, touch you
Hold you, love you, promise, I promise
I promise you, I'll stay with you, but 'til then

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes and imagine me home again
I mean every word I say (Never gonna go)
Soon I'll be back and you'll never be alone again
This time (This time) I mean to stay (Gotta hold on)
Just close your eyes and imagine me home again
Soon I will be on my way (Never gonna go)

But if you got it, don't let go

In my heart and in my mind

And stay with me if you'd like to
Come put your hand in mine

Over the canyon
And you're feeling
Lost and abandoned
Some stranger may knock
Upon your door
And it may be like knowing
Someone you never met before

Now it may be a common sensation
It may lead to sadness or elation
But it's a chance
That you never had before
And it may be like knowing
Someone you never met before

Don't be afraid
The game's not been played
Until you discover your love
She's waiting for you
And all you gotta do
Is let her in, and get her in
And don't live life lonely

So when the sun
Goes down on the city
Don't give in to feeling self-pity

You're lonely, though illusion keeps you company
Take a look around
Does your little town exist
Or is it just too far from your reality

I know it can't be very easy
To be brought up treated royally
To have so-called friends all around
Who cater to you loyally
Don't it make you wonder
As you listen for the thunder

Of your deepest soul
That's an empty hole

Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend, but I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus, You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend, but I always thought that I'd see you again
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again

Even when I'm feeling down
So every night I go out on the town
Circulating around
Well I thought I could forget about you
But every night I find
It's not easy as I thought it would be
To dance you out of my mind

You've got me dancing with tears in my eyes
Dancing with tears in my eyes
You've got me dancing with a hurt in my soul

Ever since we said our goodbyes
Don't you know you can find me any old time

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Dancing with tears in my eyes

Now anything can happen in this day and age
Just take a look at me
My body keeps moving to the happy beat
While my spirit's in misery

No, I don't look out of place
But there's a whole different picture you'll see of me

When I left the world behind me
Retreating through the past
You reached out to find me
And brought me back at last
You've shown me something
Beyond my looking glass
Now love's in my reflection (Love's in my reflection)
In the shadow that you cast on me, and you
You're something new

[Chorus]
You're something new
Under the sun
Under the moon, you're the light of creation
And I knew
That I'd come to love you

[Verse 2]
Life seemed oh-so-temporary (Life seemed oh-so-temporary)
A case of here and gone (A case of here and gone)
And I survived, just barely
Until you came along
But now each day I'm given
Is one more day I know (One day I know)
A love that's so unselfish
It's a pleasure just to show my love to you
(Just to show my love to you)
You're something new

These days, baby that's all she's got
She tries so hard just to stay in touch
But auld acquaintance long forgot
A half cup of coffee steaming in her hand
Too bad things didn't turn out quite the way she planned
She had hold of the brass ring but it came back sand
And broken promises

Do you feel love
Do you feel love tonight
Do you feel love
Do you feel love tonight

Yesterday I ran into an old friend
Standing on a corner in a cold sweat
So I took him walking down on Deal Street
To make a payment on a years-old debt
He told me what he's feeling; I told him all I know
He told me all about the fear when the night winds blow
Hey you don't need to hold on to wrongs of long ago
And broken promises

1855046,Carole King,Sweet Baby James,"1 ContributorSweet Baby James LyricsThere is a young cowboy, he lives on the range. His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons, waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire, thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire, he sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear...
Goodnight you moon light ladies, rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose, won't you let me go down in my dreams?
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Now the first of December was covered with snow
And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
Though the Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go
There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky, maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me
So, goodnight you moon light ladies, rock-a-bye sweet baby James

Like so many motes of dust
My dreams keep stirring in me
But all I see are
Rivers of violence
Running red on the streets below me
While passionate strangers whisper desire
All I know is I'm on fire

I need just one thing I can believe in
Oh, just one thing
Just one thing I can believe in

Hiding in the shadows
I want to stand in the light
Trust is unknown to me
I've been betrayed by the night so long
I can never belong to anyone any more
Why does everybody think they know me
I go through the motions, playing my role
Nobody knows what's deep in my soul

I need just one thing I can believe in
Give me just one thing
Oh, just one thing I can believe in

But every time I turned around, love let me down

In my imagination
I come out of the darkness
The moon in my fantasy smiles down on me
I am a child running wild and free
But then the fight for survival
Takes me out of my illusion
And I'm back in the emptiness, fear and defeat
Trapped in a rhythm I don't want to repeat
The taste of freedom is so close and sweet
I've just gotta find a way off this dead-end street

And watch yourself unfold
You can drink right from the river
And purify your soul

Let your holy mix distill

Who need pain to feel alive
But now I'm kind of like a child

To waiting on the wisdom that

By Carole King

Here we are in time alone
No one else's feelings but our own
Seems to me that we have always known
What love was meant to be

Separately we stood before
Life was good but we knew there should
Be more
Time alone could open up the door
And you came through for me

No sign of the changes we have come through
No mind of the strangers who think they
Know you

Now as one we are the a light
Though sometimes we were blinded by the night
Here in time alone it all seems right
And I'm feeling wholly free

In the cold November sky
The locust sang a midnight song
And starlight wind was a sigh
And you moved me with no hand

The icy roofs below me now
Shelter all the souls within
But oh, nothing shelters me
From the thought of what could have been
Why does laughter remembered
Always lead me to tears
I've got the life I want, but I don't have what I need

Why do you do this to yourself

You ought to leave the dust on the shelf

Of mind games and power plays
Or are we gonna take the chance of a lifetime
To see the light of day

What'll we see when we've used up the last supplies
Of rainbows and butterflies
I keep believing if we all work together
We will surely find a way

We are lost in a labyrinth
There's only one thing to do

Just break down the walls
And reach out your hand to your brother
We can lead each other
To where destiny calls
Faith and lovin' energy will see us through

After a while we will see
The labyrinth isn't anyplace we need to be
Then we can come out from the heart of the darkness
Into a brighter day

One of these days we will know
The heart will take us anywhere we want to go
I only hope it's not too late for the purpose
Tho' just what that is I can't say

By Carole King

From the shelter of your solitude you see her
Running circles round the emptiness within
And you wonder what it's been like to be her
As you feel yourself awakening
Though she fills her life between with new adventure
There's confusion in her eyes each time you meet
You don't think she's gonna last another winter
With all the snow she's rakin' in

CHORUS:
You can't believe you still want her
After all these years of knowing her so well
ALl the same you'd willingly consign yourself
To a life of hell

You would think by now you'de see it in perspective
She's too insecure to ever really change
You've convinced yourself this time you'll be objective
You won't need any breakin' in
There's no reason to believe it will be different
She's still playing games and running from herself
But you've always thought you love for her could save her
And that's how you get taken in

1725429,Carole King,Friday’s Tie-Dye Nightmare,"3 ContributorsFriday’s Tie-Dye Nightmare LyricsIn Friday's tie-dye nightmare
I was trying to get from here to there
Walking to, passing through people everywhere
I got on at my station, running through the fire
Looking for an elevation that would get me a little higher

News of people dying, someone lying on the stair
Crying for the nation, can we offer up a prayer
There'll be a coronation, a fancy dress affair
We'll be lined up in formation, but we won't be going anywhere

Down the hellhole, trying to make my way
I couldn't get where I wanted, due to an unforeseen delay
The man was apologetic as he turned his head to say
Sorry, kid, you're not gonna make it home today
Hey mister, why'd you take my ticket away
Even more to the point, how come I let you
I could blame it all on you, or make up my mind to stay
I wish I knew a way I could forget you

I didn't read the fine print, y'gotta be on the ball
Some days I'm less confident, up against a wall
I wonder where my mind went, I should have made the call
I like to think I'm innocent, but then, don't we all

I got to the next location, hoping for the best
But another situation put me to the test
A man in black pants, a white shirt, and a red vest
Had fallen on the track and no one even got depressed
Or even guessed he wasn't putting on an act
Someone said he'd drunk too much
'Cause he was lying on his back
It was also duly noted that he happened to be black
There was a serious lack of anything right at all here
You might also likeWhat's the difference--I didn't stop
The very least I could have done was call a cop
But I passed the news vendor, pursuing my agenda
And I like everyone else, I dropped the ball here

Still trying to get home, I saw a telephone
And put some coins I had found
They were supposed to work, they did for the man beside me
But when I dropped them in, they wouldn't go down

What is going on here
Will I ever know the truth
How do to deal with the time stealing away your daddy's youth
Story after story of disaster barely missed
You see, common miracles somehow do exist
And anyone can be kissed by lady fortune

So I gathered up my skirt and tucked my wallet in
Grabbed my bag and the sling I carried my girl child in
Funny she didn't cry, she wasn't scared at all
She could see a happy outcome in the patterns on the wall

And y'know
The next train was the right one, but not for the vested man
I try, but there's too many things I'll never understand
Y'gotta keep on going knowing someone's got a plan

Once I told you without feeling
When you came to me in sorrow
There's a truth that life's revealing
We all have to be alone

[Verse 2]
You wanted someone who would hold you
Tell you she'd be there tomorrow
But instead I only told you
We all have to be alone

[Bridge]
Then I was amazed to see
How quickly you agreed with me
If that's the way it has to be
There's nothing left to say
No reason left to stay
Besides I've got a lot of better things to do today

So my world grew so much colder
With little love to lend or borrow
And I found out as I grew older

Standing on a corner with the afternoon's supply
She spoke of other places, perhaps a better road
Then she asked if I could tell her where they kept the mother lode

Like a night this side of dying
Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf
When she hears her lifeline crying
Not a thing you say can stop her
When she just can't stop herself

[Verse 2]
I remember that July, the panic and the heat
The savage shine of summer, the strychnine in the street
The way they sold each other for a favor in glassine
The best of friends sold brothers for a dime of quinine dreams

They're always writing songs about a summer love
That never seems to last beyond the fall
But I've a different reason for crying this season
The reason that can hurt you most of all

[Verse 1]
I didn't have any summer romance
Nobody bothered to break my heart in two
While others were fooled by the sweet words someone vowed
I was the one who made company a crowd

[Verse 2]
I didn't walk down the beach in a trance
Or listen to little white lies that sounded true
And no one could be as blue as I was in the fall
'Cause I didn't have any summer romance at all

[Instrumental]

It's hard enough to hear you
Express your sympathy
But it's harder still to feel the things
My eyes refuse to see

[Chorus]
Oh, my lovin' eyes (Oh, my lovin' eyes)
When you look upon them, darlin', like you do
You bring these tears into
My lovin' eyes (Lovin' eyes)

[Verse 2]
I watch you take my self-respect
Accepting each excuse
When I've never seen the reason
For your moods or your abuse

[Chorus]
Oh, my lovin' eyes (Oh, my lovin' eyes)
They hold you like the heavens hold the sun
But look what you've done to
My lovin' eyes (My lovin' eyes)

[Bridge]
Like a man whose way is righteous
His faith in life resigned
I'm a child whose eyes are sightless
And my faith in you is truly blind

And it's sad to think of living
As pain that we must feel
But it's sadder still to think of love
As something you conceal

[Chorus]
Oh, my lovin' eyes (Oh, my lovin' eyes)
When you look upon them, darlin', like you do
You bring these tears into
My lovin' eyes (Lovin' eyes)

Girl, this is goodbye for us
I'm afraid there's no two ways about it
Now you say you need my love
But you'll just have to learn to live without it

[Chorus]
So goes love
Don't try to understand it
Ah, so goes love
It never works the way you planned it

[Verse 2]
When you meant the world to me
That's the time you said you didn't want me
You played around in front of me
Yeah, you did everything you could to taunt me

[Chorus]
So goes love
Don't try to analyze it
Ah, so goes love
And when it dies you can't disguise it

It's been said
You've made your bed and now you'll have to lie in it
There's no denying it's a shame

Something they call freedom of choice
That you should not live without

Me, I'm feelin' lazy
And it's me that's on the line
I may be crazy
But I've been crazy for a long time

You take your action on weekends at a time
But you can make all week your own
If you set your mind
You see security in the chrome American dream
But I don't believe in livin' in the middle
With available extremes

Now there's many people see the truth in what I'm sayin'
But it's hard to make up your mind with a programmed brain

Geese in flight and dogs that bite
And signs that might be omens say I'm going, going, going to Carolina in my mind
With a holy host of others standing round me, still I'm on the dark side of the moon
And it seems like it goes on like this forever, you must forgive me

Seems so hard
All I want to do is let down my guard
Laugh like a child and play out in the yard
I want to feel safe again

I don't know
What happened to you, where did you go
Wish I could not feel the cold wind blow
I want to feel safe again

If only I could believe everything will soon be
Like all the fairy tales I've read
But I feel so lost and naked
And I wake up with the shape of a dream
In my head

Seems so hard
All I want to do is let down my guard
Get through just one more day unscarred
I want to feel safe again
I want to feel safe again
Safe again with you

I have always wanted to be a girl like you
Long of leg and seeing the world the way you do
But you're in tiny golden chains
Somehow I think you know it don't make sense for you
To let your wings be held by someone
Who's too intense for you

Alabaster Lady
You are such a sweet and sensual spirit
There's a joy within him singing
And he loves you 'cause he knows that you can hear it
Still the child within remains
And though he knows that you have pains to talk about
He sees your soul as you walk about
And doesn't dare to let himself get near it

You're so very young
Your life is just beginning
Your consciousness begun
Like a sleepy child awakening
As you reach out for me
With confidence still to come
Can you teach me to be free
Of my fear of being struck down by the pendulum

Selling things that self destruct and make us bleed
One day it's all gonna fall down

With the warmth of the sun behind the haze
When your lifestyle quickly rearranges
May you follow the passing of the days

Like Dumbo flying high in the nightly show
You think you can't fly without them
But someday when it happens you will know

May you travel bright and cheery

Thank you. 

[Chorus]
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Ooh, baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh, darling, I can't stand it
When you look at me that way

And you tenderly call my name

And your illusions disappear
And you fear the speeding time

You find a dream that you embrace
Look the other way and it's a race
Trying to keep pace with the speeding time

Don't see no more dancin' on the street
And its not easy to laugh at your defeat

But hang in--hold on
There will be relief
Y'gotta try, gotta try to keep your love alive
In this speeding time

Get your feet on solid ground
It's a nightmare you have found
The howling sound of speeding time
Y'hear the cries behind stone walls
Decipher echoes down the halls
But don't you fall in the speeding time

Drifting back is no way to begin

When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

[Chorus]
On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

[Verse 2]
When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof)
I get away from the hustle and crowd
And all that rat race noise down in the street (Up on the roof)

[Chorus]
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Oh, let's go up on the roof

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus]
At night the stars put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
I keep on telling you

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof (Up on the roof)
So if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two, up on the roof (Up on the roof)

Up on the roof, everything is all right
Up on the roof, oh, come on, baby
I just wanna be with you baby up on the roof

He's been without a home
Once he lived on an open plain where wildlife grazed
And buffalo used to roam
Red was the sunrise on the dawn of his creation
Now where is the road that will lead him to his destination
It took so little time to destroy a way of life
They served his people well
Gifts that they gave in all good faith
Have been misused and shot to hell
You who want wisdom, turn and face the four directions
For only those with one heart, fall under their protection

""I Can't Make It Alone!"" That's too bad. 

Thank you. It's, it's nice that you know that, that I wrote that one. However, I don't know that one. 

No I always, I always think about it, how embarrassing it would be if I did forget the words or something. You know, nobody would, everybody would believe that somebody else wrote these things. It's not true, I really wrote them. But I do sometimes forget the words. 

[Verse 1]
Oh now Smackwater Jack he bought a shotgun
'Cause he was in the mood for a little confrontation
He just let it all hang loose
He didn't think about the noose
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation

[Chorus]
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand

[Verse 2]
Oh now Big Jim the Chief stood for law and order (Yes he did)
He called for the guard to come and surround the border
Now from his bulldog mouth
As he led the posse south
Came the cry, ""We got to ride to clean up the streets
For our wives and our daughters"" (Oh, Lord, Lord)

And how many tears can you cry when someone makes you blue?
That's a question I'm still unable to answer
'Cause I can't stop my cryin' over you

And how many lies can you count before your heart is free?

'Cause I'm still countin' the lies you told to me

(Yum diddy dum diddy um)

There's just no end to all the broken promises that I recall
I was a fool to fall for you
It hurts to know you played a game and went and had yourself a ball
And through it all made me blue

(Yum diddy dum diddy um)

And how many tears can you cry when you want someone new?

Herdin' her goats on the hillside
No one knows
And she ain't tellin' her age
I'd say she's just about seventy-five

She's an old timer tryin'
To hold on to what she's got
They call her Goat Annie

I still remember the stories
The townspeople told to each other
Just because she liked her goats
Better than people
They said the devil was her brother

She never paid them no mind
She just kept on
Bein' herself--Goat Annie

She's a rare individual
One of a dying breed
Everything she's got
Right now
Is all she'll ever need

They had to have
The land she lived on
They came with the papers
Polite as could be
They said she had just thirty days
To get gone

You could see them smirking
We're just doin' our job here
You understand, Goat Annie

She said, I was born and raised here
Ain't never done wrong to no one
You ain't gonna
Throw me off my land, not
Me or my goats or my shotgun

Then she leveled her 12-gauge
With a blast, she sent 'em packin'
Go, Goat Annie

Next day they came with the lawmen
But that didn't get 'em nowhere
Rather than shoot
At a poor old lady
They decided to let her
Live her days out there
It doesn't happen very often
But there are still some people

But y'gotta know how to handle your love

But when y'walk in the room
And it starts to glow

Though her wings still touch the ground

He's been away from what he loves the best
But his spirit isn't broken
He feels content around the Eagle's nest
Ah, but you can feel his patience
And you know whatever strong heart does

Though her wings still touch the ground
Soon she's gonna rise up

Fly, Eagle

Through it all she tends her young ones
Doing what she can to help them grow
Maybe they will fly away before her
And her only choice is just to let them go
Eagle sees her sister
Living free up on the mountain top
So she doubles her effort
Till you think that she is bound to drop

In the marketplace
Somebody touched my hand and said
I was a woman of taste
Then with a flutter of wings
Amid the clutter of things
I saw the Venusian Diamond through a sea of grace

It said, 'Lay all of your money down
And I will be your own
Do it if you can
If you don't, you better leave it alone'
Then there appeared a serpent hanging
Like a thunder rope
He said, 'Pull me'--I did
And fell into the wrong end of a telescope
So I began to run
I knew not to where I'd come
I could hear the Venusian Diamond and it
Gave me hope
It said, 'Shatter all your images
And I will be your own
Do it if you can
If you don't, you better leave it alone'

2012154,Carole King,So Far Away (Live In Concert),"1 ContributorSo Far Away (Live In Concert) Lyrics[Chorus]
So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
How I wish I could
But you're so far away

[Verse 1]
One more song about moving along the highway
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

[Chorus]
But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
Yeah, you're so far away

[Verse 2]
Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothing else to do but close my mind
I sure hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find, I've yet to find
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, but you're so far away

Doesn't help to know you're so far away

Hey, you're so far away

Oh, you-you were the boy next door
We treated each other
Like sister and brother
It was never anything more, woah-oh

We grew up together
And darlin', you know it breaks my heart
'Cause I never knew
How much I loved you
Until we grew apart

You know, I remember once
You asked me for a date
And I turned you down
'Cause I just couldn't think of you that way
Well, I'vе only got myself to blame
'Cause you nеver asked me again

Hard selling what we both know tomorrow you may
Not be able to give away
And as I leave the stage
Dancing through my rage
I feel helpless as the music goes on, and we turn to another page

Dancing--everybody's dancing
Moving through the ballet
Never missing a cue
How sad, but how beautiful it can be
To watch the choreography
As we play out our fantasy

Red hair flashing under amber-colored lights
You pirouette too smoothly as you move around your ladies
And your fear of lonely nights
As you leap across the air
You're so perfectly aware
Of your audience in rapt attention
As you hang suspended there

You do have a tender side
I can feel it, though you've always tried to hide
It from me
'Cause you know that I'm one woman who's strong enough to see you
As you've always been afraid to be

And you were the right one, you got it
So we could just play around
We wouldn't get serious or mysterious

I wasn't gonna fall in love, till I fell in love with you

Well, you got down, saw through me
You read me like a book
You took me over and over again
And you turned my head around

I found I didn't know what I thought I knew
I was caught up in you so fast
Emotional, love potion-al
I want to make every moment last

I wasn't gonna fall in love, no, I wasn't gonna fall
I wasn't gonna fall in love, till I fell in love with you

Never know what's gonna, never know what's gonna come along
To change your mind, change your way

That seems to leave this troubled world behind
And if I'm feeling down and blue or troubled by some foolish game
She always seems to make me change my mind
And I feel fine anytime she's around me now, she's around me now almost about all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time and I feel fine
Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening in places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me and to silently remind me
Of the happiness and the good times that I know, and then I just got to go then
It isn't what she's got to say but how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way, it doesn't much matter what they mean
She says them mostly just to calm me down
And I feel fine anytime she's around me now, she's around me now almost about all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now

Where I can find shelter
From hunger and cold
And the sweet tastin' good life

The first thing I'll see
Is the sun shining golden
Shining right down on me
Then trouble's gonna lose me
Worry leave me behind
And I'll stand up proudly
In true peace of mind
Talking 'bout a, talking 'bout a

In a garden of wisdom

An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold
Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side
He moved with some uncertainty, as if we didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree
And his hand came down empty
Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well
As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back

I don't remember just exactly how it started
All I know is we're both alone and broken-hearted
It doesn't make a bit of sense to me
Why should two people in love have to be

[Chorus]
Like little children
Who don't know wrong from right
Like little children
Who just can't help but fight
Why should two grown people have to act
Like little children?

[Verse 2]
There's no storm that you and I can't weather
If we just take the time to talk it out together
But when talkin' stops, tempers rise
And we both do things that aren't wise

[Chorus]
Like little children
Who don't know wrong from right
Like little children
Who just can't help but fight
Why should two grown people have to act
Like little children?

I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games to only pass the time
No more electric trains, no more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

[Verse 2]
I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
Now I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide
And every day can be my magic carpet ride
A little bit of freedom is all wе lack
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back

Don't be afraid to try
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you

You've got a need for company
Someone you know will be there
Don't let your bruised and battered soul deny it
My scars are plain to see
But love's been good to me
And I know it's because I was willing to try it

So if you want to love again
Don't hesitate any more
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you

Throw it out, let it fly
Let it soar, watch it sail across the sky
Mountains are there for you to climb
People are doing it all the time
You can make it to the top if you make your attempt a strong one

So if you want to give your heart
Don't be afraid to try

""First of all, I wanna say thank you for coming because it was supposed to R-A-I-N and, so far, we're sending out great vibrations; keep it up!""

[Chorus]
You’ve got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful as you feel

[Verse 1]
Waiting at the station with a workday wind a-blowing
I’ve got nothing to do but watch the passers-by
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
And they don't see it showing, why do I?

[Chorus]
You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all thе love in your heart
Then pеople gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful as you feel

[Verse 2]
I have often asked myself the reason for the sadness
In a world where tears are just a lullaby
If there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try

Who has all the papers, who keeps in touch?

Who loves life while seeing its flaw?
And why am I nervous with questions like this?
Perhaps it's because I know
I'd trade them all for a kiss

High on her snow-covered mountain
From her throne she looks down at the clowns
Who think youth can be found in a fountain
High on the wings of her rhythm
She will smile at the guys who come on with their eyes
But she'll never dance with 'em

[Chorus]
And in smoke-filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around
The Snow Queen

[Verse 2]
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you will soon bite the dust
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a losеr
But in mid-air you'll be hung while you trip on your tongue
And it'll only amusе her

[Chorus]
In the morning haze you are frozen there
Caught in the icy stare of
The Snow Queen

No, my friend, she doesn't want what you're selling
Oh, my friend, there must be a place you can hide

And into the night you'll fade, knowing you've lost the game
And just how she got the name of
The Snow Queen

Well, right about now I think I'm gonna get some help. Would you welcome please Charlie Larkey on bass. 

This is, uh, about some old friends. It's called ""A Song of Long Ago."" Not to be confused with ""Long Ago and Far Away."" You see, I wrote this under the heavy influence of James Taylor. 

[Verse 1]
Whispering wind came, uninvited
Looking for somewhere else to go
Here is a lamp I've left unlighted
Aren't you someone I should know?
Memory's flame is soon ignited
Lighting my lamp with amber glow
Quietly, friends are reunited
Singing a song of long ago

[Chorus]
La la la, la da doh da
La da la, la la la
La da da da
Da da da la la da da da da
Doh la da la da

Who just can't be happy
And be glad you can feel enough to cry

Younger than always, time descended
Bringing me brand new seeds to sow
Now that they've been a long time planted
What must I do to help them grow?
If it had been as I intended
I wouldn't have the peace I know

And singing a song of long ago

When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all I had faith in you
I just kept on saying

[Chorus]
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

[Verse 2]
My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to what she said
I just kept on saying

[Chorus]
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they werе toys

[Verse 3]
You and I, we got a special thing
Go togethеr just like summer and spring
And they're all jealous of the love you bring
And I'm gonna keep on saying

Was a time I remember
Hope flashed and went dim
When assassins just happened
To do the right people in
And love was the slogan
Coincidentally
And they told us they'd work it out
Eventually

[Verse 2]
In the swing of changing times
A man cried out for his
And every, every politician said
He was telling us like it is
Yes, they walked down the angry streets
To have themselves a look-see
And they told us they'd work it out
Eventually

[Verse 3]
I see the choking cities
I see them tearing up the earth
I see people feelin'
That their lives have little worth
And I know that the future
Depends on you and me
I just hope we can work it out

My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view
Wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold

[Verse 2]
Once amid the soft and silver sadness in the sky
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors, yellow-green on either side

[Bridge]
He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go
Once he reached for something golden hanging from a tree
And his hand came down empty

[Verse 3]
Soon within my tapestry along the rutted road
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well

[Verse 4]
As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure gray and ghostly beneath a flowing beard
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black
Now my tapestry's unraveling, he's come to take me back

[Chorus]
Meet me on the highway
Meet me on the road
As long as you've got to travel
Don't you want someone to help you carry your load?

[Verse 1]
First time out was a heady feeling
White clouds under my feet
Sailin' along like a south wind
Over fields of whispering wheat
Thinkin' alone on a Thursday morning
Of peace and love and war
I still don't have any answer
And I don't get high anymore

[Chorus]
Meet me on the highway
Meet me on the road
As long as you've got to travel
Don't you want someone to help you carry your load?

[Verse 2]
Some folks are forever movin'
Some folks gotta stay still
Don't let it get you—there's joy in either
So do what you will
Everyone knows it's the same old feelin'
Worlds below the sea
Just you and me and easy
Is where I wanna be

I want you to see that I have a left side. 

This is a song that has been recorded by, uh, such notables as Dusty Springfield and Barbra Streisand and Laura Nyro. A fine lady if there ever was one. 

[Verse 1]
Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal
Just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down

[Verse 2]
The view from the cliffs must have been exciting (Exciting)
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone
And the path is unknown
And there is no easy way down

[Bridge]
No, it isn't very easy
Oh, when you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy
When each road you take
Is one more mistake
And there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home

Where our fantasy world can be found

There is no easy way down

You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes you will
That you're beautiful as you feel

[Verse 1]
Waiting at the station with a workday wind a-blowing
I've got nothing to do but watch the passers-by
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
And they don't see it showing, why do I?

[Chorus]
You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes you will
That you're beautiful as you feel

[Verse 2]
I have often asked myself the reason for the sadness
In a world where tears are just a lullaby
If there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try

Green fields and rolling hills
Room enough to do what we will
Sweet dreams of yestertime
Are running through my mind
Of a place I left behind

[Chorus]
Been so long, I can't remember when
I’ve been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Been so long, I'm living 'til then
’Cause I've been to Canaan and I won't rest until I go back again

[Verse 2]
Though I'm content with myself
Sometimes I long to be somewhere else
I try to do what I can
But with our day-to-day demands
We all need a promised land

[Chorus]
And it's been so long, I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Been so long, I'm living ’til then
I’ve been to Canaan and I won't rest until I go back again

With a fireplace burning to warm me
And you to hold me when it’s stormy

Been so long, I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Been so long, I'm living ’til then
I've been to Canaan and I won't rest until I go back again
I've been to Canaan and I won't rest until I go back again

Way over yonder
Is a place that I know
Where I can find shelter
From a-hunger and cold
And the sweet tasting good life
Is easily found

I know when I get there
The first thing I'll see
Is the sun shining golden
Shining right down on me
Then trouble's gonna lose me
Worry leave me behind
And I'll stand up proudly

9640418,Carole King,Love For Christmas,"1 ContributorLove For Christmas LyricsI love you and it's Christmas
And I don't know what to do
'Cause there's so much that you dream of
That I can't give to you
It makes sad to think of you
Going without this year
While others all around you
Celebrate with Christmas cheer

There is so much that you wish for
That I wish that I could buy
If only I could be the one to fill your stocking high
I want to give you everything
But all that I can do
Is give you love for Christmas
To last the whole year through

Maybe next year with a miracle
I can give you more
But no matter what, I'll be with you
Of that you can be sure

I'm so grateful for the small things
Every Christmas card I read
In the morning when I see you smile
You're all the gift I need
I want to give you everything but all that I can do
Is give you love for Christmas
I will give you love for Christmas
I will give you love for Christmas
That will last the whole year throughYou might also likeEmbed",0,/songs/9640418,Love For Christmas by Carole King,https://images.genius.com/dd2c2c8cbb4e810595e807e41e9486e7.300x300x1.webp,https://images.genius.com/dd2c2c8cbb4e810595e807e41e9486e7.358x358x1.webp,19665419,complete,/Carole-king-love-for-christmas-lyrics,,https://images.genius.com/dd2c2c8cbb4e810595e807e41e9486e7.300x300x1.webp,https://images.genius.com/dd2c2c8cbb4e810595e807e41e9486e7.358x358x1.webp,Love For Christmas,https://genius.com/Carole-king-love-for-christmas-lyrics,/albums/1096232,https://images.genius.com/dd2c2c8cbb4e810595e807e41e9486e7.358x358x1.webp,Love Makes The World: Deluxe Edition by Carole King,1096232.0,Love Makes The World: Deluxe Edition,"May 8, 2007",https://genius.com/albums/Carole-king/Love-makes-the-world-deluxe-edition
9640437,Carole King,Two Hearts,"1 ContributorTwo Hearts LyricsGetting off the freeway, shaking off a bad day
Gotta change the feeling, and it doesn't matter how
Suddenly I see you pulling in the driveway
I can't wait to hold you, and it doesn't matter now
I go to kiss you on the shoulder
But I feel you leave, you're moving away

You've got to tell me what you're thinking
How else am I supposed to know
We've got to put our hearts together
And let the love between us grow
Two hearts

Standing in the kitchen just past the doorway
I reach out to touch you, but you just turn away
I want to make you happy, and I'll do it your way
Whatever it is, just tell me, we can't go on this way
Every day we're both a little older
Don't you feel the time rushing away

You've got to tell me what you're thinking
How else am I supposed to know
We've got to put our hearts together
And let the love between us grow
Two hearts

Take a look at us, take a look at these two hearts

Every day we're both a little older
Don't you feel the time rushing away

How else am I supposed to know
We've got to put our hearts together
And let the love between us grow
