Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for the homies in the chow hall (Woah)
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad (Woo)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Kidnap a nigga like ISIS (Woah)
Turn a whole world to a crisis (Woah)
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo)
Beat the police with a nightstick (Boop)
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk (Woo, woah)
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out (Woah)
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house (Woah)
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch (Woah)
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out (Woah)
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow (Woah)
E'rybody dissin' just to have clout (Woah)
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? (Woah)
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin
I ain't settlin' for nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' (Bop)
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' (Brrrap, brap, bop)
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven (Bop, bop, brrrap, brap)
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? (Woo)
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties (Woah)
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine (Joyner)
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time (Woo)
We do not share the same bloodline (No)
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time (Woo)

According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore (Woah)
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for the days that were all bad (Woo)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, then you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS (ISIS)
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit (Body this shit)
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis, you Kelly, you pussy (You pussy)
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton
You at Target with your mom
On the internet still hatin' on my last post (I hate this nigga)
I just sent a steak back at Mastro's, my God
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And 5'9"" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune and we sealed the game's doom
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo
[Chorus: Logic]
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo

2836122,Joyner Lucas,I’m Sorry,"149 ContributorsI’m Sorry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Go ahead and call me a coward
Say that I'm not strong because I'm not like you
Go ahead and call me crazy
'Cause I live in a maze, tell me how about you?
I think I live in my head
Sometimes I think that I'm dead, I hide behind my youth
Know I been losing my mind
And I'm a little behind, step inside my shoes
'Cause I've never been happy with myself
And I don't need no one feeling bad for me
Tryna to offer me pity and throw jabs at me
Wanna give me advice and then laugh at me
Behind closed doors, just close the door
Let me be by myself—just me and myself
I'm tired of living, I cry
I hear it's easy to die, I wanna see for myself
And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else
But I'm depressed as fuck, stressed as fuck
Ain't no medicine that could cure what's the test as drugs
I mean, I need extra love
And that ain't even enough, said that ain't even enough
And where the fuck is God? (God, God)
Damn, maybe I ain't believing enough
But today, we gonna see if he's real
And if He is, then I guess I'm prolly going to hell
Look, I ain't wanna die like this
I ain't picture my life like this
They don't know what it's like like this
Pretending I'm happy so I can smile like this, and laugh like you
Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you
Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like, ""Woo!""
Or would you feel lost without me?
'Cause honestly, I think the world is better off without me
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is I don't care how they feel about my feelings
I made up my mind, I'm going out like Robin Williams
I guess I'm not the Ordinary People of John Legend
And I've been suicidal since the day I was nine, shit
Okay, the day I was nine
I've been tired of being bullied, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time
And dammit, look at me now, fuck
Fuck, pen runnin' out, shit, fu—, ugh
Look, just know it's a new day
But if you reading this, then it's prolly too late, blaow!

I hope you got what you wanted
I hope you finally happy, it's too late for you
Been going out of my mind
You don't know how many times that I done prayed for you
I hope you hear me, goddammit
'Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you
I used to shine, now I'm all in the dark
I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart
But goddammit, look at you now, it's all of your fault
How could you? Maybe it's my fault
I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin'
Maybe I should have been more of an influence
I can't believe that you're dead, I fu–
I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it
But I'll forever be attached to you (Damn)
Part of me feels bad for you
A part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you
And I don't mean to be insensitive
But I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit
You took the easy way out, goddammit, you did
I mean, look what you did, I'm so fucking upset
How could you be so selfish?
Nigga, how could you be so selfish?
Now you're gone, you done left me so helpless
I wonder what God thinks, I hope you in God's place behaving yourself
Yo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself? (Say for yourself)
Look, I really feel lost without you
I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is: I don't care how you feel about my feelings
And I'd be lying to you if I told you I'm fine, listen
I know that you can hear me, all I need is like five minutes
I just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out
I'm sorry this is something that we both couldn't figure out
I wish I could hear you now, is your soul missing?
I wonder if you could do it again, would you do it different?
Tell me what death is like
Was it meant for you, brodie? Did the heaven support it?
Are you fucking happy now? Did you get what you wanted?
Isn't this what you wanted? I feel the temperature falling
And you've been suicidal back then you were nine?
Yeah, even back then, you was nine
We was living on the edge, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time
And damn it, look at you now, shit
But it's a new day
And if you can't hear me, it's probably too late, fuck!

Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry

With all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', ""Nigga,"" this, and, ""Nigga,"" that
Call everybody, ""Nigga,"" and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, ""Nigga,"" then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
""They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom""
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear

With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, ""All Lives Matter,"" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, ""Nigga,"" is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
[Outro]
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'

Couldn't get a buzz even if you had lightyear
Wouldn't get no love even if your heart's right here
Niggas got guns so nobody want to fight fair, no
Hit 'em with the Ric Flair and the suplex
I ain't never been scared, bitch, I'm ruthless (Woo)
Raised by the ghetto
Know some gangs that'll get 'em
Split 'em right down the middle like a fuckin' duplex
Break a nigga toes, make 'em do the two-step
Crib full of hoes, now I feel like Hugh Hef
Got a bad stripper bitch, all we do is have sex
And she love suckin' dick so I call her loose neck (Woah)
Makin' a panic with my shit and I'm flippin' up banisters
I'm ready to handle and dismantle and crush and vanish
I hit 'em and send 'em into walls, then I got 'em enchanted
Then my fuckin hands that holdin the hammer bangin' and slammin'
Killin' 'em in the ambulance, they dyin', they bleedin', they tremblin'
I'm really sick and I got a stiff as a fuckin' mannequin
I paint a picture a Picasso vision, all on my cellophane
I got 'em swingin' they on my dick and grabbin my pants again
Now, uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco (Cinco)
I ain't Spanish but I know the lingo (Lingo)

But my album ain't come unless I got a fuckin' single

I'm willing to die for this shit
I'm ready to flip it and end up in prison the rest of my life for this shit
So my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion
I end up surviving this shit
And if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money
I'd probably be robbing and shit
Don't know how much I cry for this shit
Said I am willing to ride for this shit
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit
Niggas say that I'm cursed 'cause I go to church and stare at the Bible and shit
Shawty say I'm the worst cause I do my dirt, and I don't be hiding this shit

[Verse]
Bitch, I'm a savage I spit at you bastards, I wonder what you gonna do to me, ho
I need to hear some more rapping
I'm just not impressed by your cash or your jewelry, ho
All you my soldiers and I'm a lieutenant
Goddammit, you should be saluting me, ho
I hope you know I ain't going nowhere
All you rappers just better get used to me, ho
Nigga, I'm Mr. Blue with my jeans, bought me a Jeep, 'cause I wasn't riding as much
My bank account looking weak, don't look at me, I ain't got time for no fun
Starting to feel like Tyrese, I'm 'bout to trip, and maybe start crying or som'
I might just hit up the Smith's, throw me a fit and wait for my wire to come
Ain't nobody give or show me love when I was coming up
I had to double up and tell these niggas buckle up before they ride
And they don't really wanna knuckle up, I hit 'em with the uppercut
I had these motherfuckers running for they life
Unidentified craft when I'm flying past, I'm an alien sailin' and if you look up in the sky
Blow your mind back, put your eyes back to your iPad, I'm an Iraqi in suicide
When the bombs are loaded and your mind explode in the wind
And you gon' sit down, repent
I was raised in the sewer; me and the It clown are friends
Red balloons for your kids, sink my tooth in ya bitch
I lost too many friends, I don't do good with kids
What you know about riding dirty in the evening?
What you know about Ramen Noodles, and a pack of sazon seasoning
What you know about leaving the oven door open when there's no heat again
And the rent is due and your landlord try and throw you out on the streets again
Nigga, I was always dreaming of a Bentley and a fucking Lamborghini when I win 'em, I'ma finally get a break
If I didn't get it way before, I guarantee that if I talk to God, then I can say I got it when I prayed
She don't really want me to get petty, turn a dime into a penny, but she know I got a lot of shit to say
I can turn some water into Henny, drink it up and let the semi shoot, I'll pop you niggas all up in the face
Blood all up in the lake, I
Wanna see your wake die
They don't wanna wave bye
Creep when I came by, teeth like a canine
Bleed through your Levi, we from the East Side
Eat when the beat's hot, tea from the teapot
Aim for the tree top, beg till your knees pop
Skrrt in a Nissan, swerve into three cars
You just a bird in a beehive, you just a cold in a room full of germs
Nigga, I said all of my idols and favorite rappers ain't been rhyming a lot
What the fuck happened to Jay Electronica? I wonder if he still got it or not
What ever happened to eLZhi? What ever happened to Meth? What happened to Beans?
What ever happened to Lauryn? What happened to Banks? Tell me what happened to Bleek?
What the fuck happened to Mos? What happened to Missy? Nigga, what happened to Ghost?
What ever happened to Cube? What up with Common? What the fuck, where did they go?
Tell me what happened to Budden's, what about Luda? I hope they ain't losing it now
Hope they get back to the music 'cause I need some new shit, I'm sick of these new niggas out, I'm that new nigga now

Father, forgive me

[Verse]
I'm staring at this Bible as I keep glancing
Dear Lord, I got questions and I need answers
Tryna understand your vision, all I see is damage
Just a bunch of dead bodies in the street camping
A bunch of lost souls on their feet standing
We supposed to be your children, I thought we family
You're supposed to be my Father, bruh, I need answers
We don't need to die young, we just need chances
Tired of living on the edge so we keep scrambling
Tryna talk to these strippers but they keep dancing
We just wanna be number one like Steve Francis
Bow our heads, say a prayer, now the seed's planted
Everywhere I turn, I'm seeing MC's vanish
Lot of good niggas gone, I don't understand it
Lot of families lost and they sea stranded
I ain't tryna disrespect you, I just need answers
I know you're watching us from heaven thinking, ""Who to save?""
Cherry pickin' who should go next and who should stay
I'd be on my way to heaven if I knew the way
And bring back every good nigga you choose to take
They say you never wrong, but you done made a few mistakes
'Cause you taking the wrong niggas, maybe you should trade
Trade us back all the real ones, remove the fakes
I think you should trade
Give us 2Pac back, and take that nigga Suge (Ooh!)
Let the legend resurrect and he gon' live for good (Ooh!)
I been screaming ""Thug life"" in every different hood (Thug life, thug life)
If only you could bring him back, Lord, I wish you would
Give us Biggie, give us Pun, give us Triple X
Take that nigga Trump with you, that's a bigger threat
There's too much power for a coward with no intellect
That's a bigot with a collar, there's a disconnect
Niggas dying, Mama crying, Grandma need a tissue
Niggas shootin' up a church, now I need a pistol
All them niggas still livin', you don't see the issue
But how you take Selena and then you take Aaliyah with you?
I ain't tryna disrespect, just need to meet up with you (Lord)
I ain't tryna overstep, just want to reason with you (Lord)
Give us back our loved ones and take the evil with you (Lord)
Send them suckers straight to hell, they don't need a vigil (Woo!)
I need you to give us back Martin Luther, take Martin Shkreli (Take!)
Give us back Malcolm, take R. Kelly
R.I.P. Lil Snupe, give that boy his life back
Take Eric Holder, give us Eric Wright back
I'm sending you this message, Lord, I hope you hit me right back
They say I'm on the wrong train, I know I'm on the right track (Yeah)
'Cause Trayvon gone, and all he did was try to fight back
Zimmerman walk around free, we don't like that (We don't like that)
Why you take our mothers from us?
Our fathers and our sisters and our cousins from us?
Got these children getting murdered while they double dutchin'
Wonder why the fuck you take Nipsey Hussle from us?
Damn, you took a true king, a true brother from us
This a fuckin' marathon, but they runnin' from us
Now everybody got guns, niggas up to something
And every gangsta wanna prove that they tough or something
You know it's not fair, tell the truth, I've been in my feelings too
But if you took Emmett Till, at least take Dylann Roof
At least take James Holmes, I ain't even mad at that
Just bring back Whitney, and give us Michael Jackson back
Feds want me in the slammer, damn
Ain't no justice for Sandra Bland, we up like the ceiling fan
Lord, if you listenin', I'm just lookin' for a hand to hand
Take out the fuck niggas and give us back our fam again
Drownin' in my tears, tryna pray for something (Woo!)
Wonder why you give us life for you to take it from us (Woo!)
Wonder why you give us family then erase them from us (Woo!)
Maybe hopefully you can have a conversation with us (Yeah)
Maybe I'm just probably tripping 'cause I need a hug (I need a hug)
The hood can't find jobs, now we need a plug (We need a plug)
Everybody and their mama tryna be a thug
I don't go to church 'cause I'm afraid of being judged
I've been starin' at the ceiling as I lie in bed
Watchin' niggas follow trends like Simon Says (Yeah)
I pray you give us back the real ones and try again
Or maybe take them niggas that deserve to die instead
Tomi Lahren run her mouth and then she get defensive
Laura Ingraham laughin' at death and disrespectin'
I really feel like you should teach them stupid hoes a lesson
Either that or give us back somebody who deserve the blessings
I left out a bunch of names that I forgot to mention
Cost too much to pay attention, then it got expensive
Father forgive me, for I know not what I do
And now I'm reachin' out to you, hopin' you hear me and return the message (Joyner)
I know that you got our back and that you're not against us
Or maybe you just love us so you doin' shit to test us
I just kinda thought that you would do more to protect us
They say that the good die young and I ain't on the guest list
I've been drinkin', Lord forgive me, it's my blood racin'
I don't know what I'm thinking, I'm just frustrated
I don't mean to question you, I'm just confused
I don't know what else to do, I've been patient and it sucks waiting
Took my mans from me, that forever hurts
But puttin' the blame on you, that'd never work
I know this ain't your fault, it's the devil's work

The more that I want, the more that I grind
The more that I shine, the more that I stride
The more that I stunt, the more that I cheat
The more that she leaves, the more that she cry
The harder to trust, the more that I lie
The more that she die, the more I realize
The more that I, the more that I (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
The more that I try, the more that I want
More that I grind, the more that I shine
The more that I stride, the more that I stunt
The more that I cheat, the more that she leave
The more that she cry, the harder to trust
The more that I lie, the more that she dies
The more I realize I'm harder to love
I’m harder to, I'm harder to teach
My heart is a beat and I am the drum
I'm harder to keep, but harder to sleep
I’m scared of the dark, I'm not gonna run
I'm harder to break, but harder to make
You get in my way, I'm drawing my gun
I'm not gonna play, I'm not for the games
I'm not gonna change, put that on my son
Put that on my mom, put that on my sis
Put that on my bitch and all of my hoes
Put that on my team, put that on my G's
I say what I mean, you already know
Put that on my city, put that on my Bentley
I got me a Bimmer, I wanted a Rolls
Sip on some Henny and ride with the semi
All my niggas with me, I’m calling a toast (Blah, blah, blah)
Callin’ the plug, you callin' the cops
I call you a snitch, you holdin’ a grudge
You callin' the judge, you say you a thug
I call you a bitch, I call you a ho
Don't call me your bro, don't call me no more, I call you a trick
I’m tired of the hate, I'm tired of the snakes
I'm tired of your face, you all on my dick
I wanted the fame, I wanted the name
I wanted a break, I wanted the love
I wanted the cake, I wanna be great
I wanted to change and all the above
You want me to fall, you want me to crawl
You want me to stall, they want me on drugs
You want me to fail, they want me in jail
They wantin' my soul, they wantin' my blood
I'm out for revenge, I'm out for the ends
I'm out for respect, I'm out for the crown
I'm out for the reign, they startin' to aim
I hopped in a plane, I'm not going down
I'm dodging the flames, they callin' my name
I wanna be saved but I don't know how
I thought it was safe, but I got a plan
Let's load up the chopper and ride it around, woo

Give me a pen
I don't even drink, but fuck it, I need some Henny and gin
Plenty of sins
I broke my bitch's heart, she'll never forgive me again
Where have you been?
I had to go find myself, I killed and buried my friends
I never could swim
I used to push some weight with niggas who been in the gym
Come step in my Timbs
You could not walk my path
I never caught my cabs, I had to walk
Niggas was lost and sad, I never would call my dad
Fuck that nigga
I was depressed as fuck, mentally torn in half
Feelin' stuck
When it was hard to laugh, the music was all I had
Wish I could be out
I never got any clout, what's all the plottin' about?
They drownin' me out
Everyone countin' me out, nobody try to reach out
You proud of me now?

I don't wanna chill, I don't wanna get no flicks
Don't wanna rekindle shit

[Verse 3]
The older the berry, the sweeter the juice
Knew I could do it, I needed the proof
In order to lose, I needed to win
In order to win, I needed to choose
I needed to fall, I needed to move
I couldn't be safe, I couldn't be you
I'm coming for everything they said I couldn't
Including your plate and all of your food
I don't wanna do no E
Don't wanna drink, I don't wanna do no lean
I don't wanna move no keys
How you like me now? I'm too OG
I feel like Kool Moe Dee
Ain't gon' be no slatt, my whole team'll crack
I seen 'em flat, never seen no snacks, they left me the scraps

Think I'm cursed again, went to church to sin
I did a lot

Got a mental block and it hurts, but then I bid and shop
And my bitch is fly, she a perfect ten

I'm about to crash Lil Yachty boat
I'm about to drag niggas by the coat
Take out your trash, sit it by the door
Shit, I got the mask on me, I'm 'bout to go
I hate when niggas act funny when I'm alone
And try to give daps to me and tip their hats to me
And they act gully when they at home
Yeah, I don't do Xannies or Mollys
Don't come near me with problems
And don't you compare me to Logic (never)
Go listen to Sriracha
Yeah, that's Amanda to Ronda
And that's a Benz to a Honda
Yeah, that's a dance with the devil
And I ain't dancing behind ya
My nigga, I'm a muthafucking entity
You don't get it, even landlords gotta pay rent to me
Gingerbread man fuckers ain't catchin' me
Sick and tired of niggas sickening, depressing me
Go to church, I testify
Pray to God I bless the beat
Kanye said ""Touch the Sky""
Future might come for me
But I'm a fucking beast and if I die, that sucks for me
But where the crown I'ma kill the king
I bet a lot of haters won't feel the same
I dug the ground, I built the ring
I cut the cow I milked the game, nigga
I should cut a hole in the sky
Make you feel the rain, nigga feel the pain, nigga
A lot of rap niggas get nervous when they hear my name, nigga
I'm insane, nigga
Back when you was watching Leave It To Beaver
I was crushing on Tila Tequila
I was swagging in Adidas and Filas
Fuckin' divas call 'em Venus, Serena
Signed my deal and told em Cesar's a beater
Hope you didn't think I needed you neither
Take it back and told 'em I didn't mean it
'Cause my uncle said it's cheaper to keep it

How many CDs could a woodchuck chuck
If he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?
Huh?
[Bridge]
Look, all you a lie
I don't cuff no hoes, you can have my bitch
I don't even mind
It seems like all these hoes wanna do is switch up
They rather be a guy
If she could suck my dick everyday for a living
Then that'd be her job, yuh
I said candy paint in yo fuckin' rims
.38 in yo fuckin' Benz
I was broke as fuck had a couple friends
A refrigerator and a cup of gin
Let's drink it up, me and you
'Cause these niggas fake, and I see it too
And they try to get me to pop Percocets and Molly
And I said

[Chorus]
I don't take no fucking percocets
Molly, Percocets
No ecstasy, promethazine
No lean, no purple mess
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step
If you don't think that I'm the shit it's just cause you ain't heard me yet
I'm about to put my mask on, my mask on
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it

All you a lie
Nigga, I ain't ever been a yes-man
All you gonna die, you can get murdered on webcam
I don't get tired; sweat through a headband
You might look alive, that's 'cause you don't really know you a dead man

[Verse 1]
This is God's plan, someone stop me
I've been sent here from Illuminati
Evil scriptures written on my body
Me and Satan pull up in a red Ferrari
Don't be tryin' to put your fuckin' arm around me
44 shots traumatizin' from the .45, hit 44 more
Carbon copies say you kamikazes
That's for e'rybody
Mama, Poppy
Sister, Brother, Cousin, Uncle, Auntie
This is not Versace, this is hot hibachi
This is Hiroshima, this is Nagasaki
I'm Mahatma Gandhi, a fuckin' humanoid Anunnaki
With plenty hammers when I'm ridin' shotty
Better use your manners when you talk about me
Ain't too hard to find me
I've been killin' niggas, still ain't nothin' left though
Joyner Lucas sicker than a strep throat
Spanish bitch that wanna give me besos
They must've forgot I was next up
Speed out your crib right after I clean out your shit and then put all of your fuckin' money in a escrow
Fuck what you sayin', I'm not the one that you play with
I think they really was thinkin' I wasn't next up
You thought wrong and you all gone, all done
I just might bring back Don Juan, I just might bring back Sean John
Tell P Diddy that I'm on one
I'ma beat it down with a Du-Rag
Pussy ate out, that's a PopCon
If I don't fuck with you, that's too bad (God damn)
Ho, you played out like the thong song
Ain't no bygones bein' bygones
I should murder niggas when I buy guns
Ho, you get stretched like Nylon
This is my band, I'm Dylon
All I wanna do is just drop bombs
On you cheerleadin' niggas with the pom-poms
My Jamaican bitch got socks on
Every time I hit it she be like, ""wagwan""
Peter Piper picked a pepper, and I picked the pressure
Pick a fight, I pick a side, I put you on a stretcher
Peter Piper picked up a nine, I put it together
Started poppin' at the people, they 'bout to meet the Beretta
Better meet the metal, I'ma need a Fujita to measure
Put you deeper than what's deep in the sea or the desert
I've been schemin' while I'm creepin', like fifty feet to the Jetta
Niggas speed and hit the pedal, I put my feet in the metal
God damn!

[Verse 2]
All of y'all wishy and washy
All y'all my kids in a car seat
I take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi
Lyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands
I think y'all need to find you a hobby
God got a plan, hope that God hold your hand
I think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!
Tell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit
And I'm comin' back to get even
I went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region
I let off this mac for no reason
You are now witnessin' greatness
I'm practically preachin' and this is the passion of Jesus
And all you basic motherfuckas are lackin' achievement
And I've just been laughin' and geekin'
Back to business, I got mad intentions
I ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions
But it's competition, I'm a savage winnin'
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician
I don't see you niggas, I've been lackin' vision
You've been actin' different, I've been actin' distant
I'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention
You gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!
This is uncomfortable, you just keep puttin' your feet in a fire
I think my gun got a crush on you, boy
You 'bout to meet your secret admirer
How you do shit you don't wanna do?
I do that shit just to keep me inspired
I used to hit it and leave when I wanted to
Now I hit it and be sleepin' aside her, woo
Roll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em
Put that motherfuckin' smoke up on 'em with that holy water
Joyner Lucas, I'ma hold 'em under, leave the motor runnin'
Man, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it
Prayed about it to the Lord about it in the mornin', but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out
I ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down
Don't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait
[Chorus]
508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride
Nigga this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied
I ain't got no fuckin' job, this my life, this my

[Verse 3]
This is God's plan, someone stop me
I was sent here from Illuminati
Evil scriptures written on my body
Me and Satan pull up in a red Bugatti
Don't be tryna put your fuckin' arm around me
Bring the drama, it ain't hard to find me
This a lucid dream, this a out-of-body
UFO flyin' while I'm ridin' shotty
I'm a ninja, pull up on a Kawasaki
187 on the cops behind me
This is Hiroshima, this is Nagasaki
I'm Mahatma Gandhi in a Maserati, god damn
Now call me Papi
Plenty hammers when I'm ridin' shotty

I got me some paper, hired a butler and got me a waiter (Woah)
I wanna get married, but none of my shorties remind me of Jada
Or maybe I'm just too afraid to settle, I wish I was plannin' it different
I think It's a phase, I'm very conditioned
I'm stuck in my ways and scared of commitment, I'm very conflicted (Ooh)
I got the drip and I'm saucy, ooh (Buck, buck, buck)
ADHD, I'm a bad boy
I think I might just pull up in the 'Rari, ooh
I might just skrrt up the Philly

What's up with you R&B niggas tryna turn rappers and trappers (Joyner, Joyner)
You should just stay in your lane, bro, you sound like PaRappa the Rapper (Yeah, yeah)
I'm looking down on you when you talk to me, you should grab you a ladder
You swung at me, only jabbed at my bladder
Watch you disappear like you abracadabra (Poosh)
Now grab me a dagger
You got some hits but you lacking a swagger (Yeah)
I'm still the shit, bitch, so that doesn't matter
Don't call me a kid, I'm your papi and dada (Hahaha)
You get splattered and flattened
You an' Trippie better have you some backup (Hol' up)
Ren and Stimpy looking agi' and staggered
And when I kill 'em, they get madder and madder
Time to get litty, bitch, fuck all that singin' (Yeah)
You challenge me, what the fuck is you thinking? (Woo)
Way too much weed, what the fuck is you drinkin'?
I brought the tsunami, you fuckers are sinkin' (Brrrat)
I'm glad that you came
Leave all that lyrical shit up to me, I'm a savage that bang
Bring all your Prada suits back to Lee Chang (Brrrat)
Take all that autotune back to T-Pain
I swear you R&B rappers is strange
You okay but you ain't nobody favorite (Yeah)
You a'ight but you ain't nobody major
5'3"", you ain't nobody dangerous (Brat)
Maybe that weed you were smoking, had you feeling confident
Let's have a real conversation (Boom)

Finna stab if you jab back, and I clap at you mad fast
When you sing, you ain't half bad, but you rapping like Ras Kass
And I bet that you mad sad 'cause you 'bout to get laughed at
And buried in trash bags and left in a hatchback, my nigga
Jamming in front of the corner store, whoa
Mobbin' a lot in the corridor, whoa
Breakin' some shit you don't want no more
Fightin' when nobody want a war
Rob at the haters, gon' sing like the Commodores
I got some shit you ain't saw before
Swallow the key and I lock the door
Tory, you ain't gotta hide no more
Come out and play, you my prey, you the GOAT? I'm a dinosaur
Oh, you wan' hate, that's normal
You just gonna do what you supposed to ('Posed to)
I remember when them hoes called me old news
Now when they cheat, I'm the go-to (Joyner)
Word on the street's I ain't one to get close to
I was hopeless, now I'm hopeful (Yuh)
I done made my own way like I'm supposed to
All you niggas did what you was told to (Yeah)
Tory, why all your songs always sound like a rerun, nigga? (Huh)
I just want my motherfucking refund, nigga (Huh)
Funny looking ass, go and eat some', nigga
I ain't never had to get my fucking teeth done, nigga (Hahaha)
When I kill you, I ain't running to you, bleed some, nigga (Yuh)
Oh, you wan' be some nigga? (Yuh)
Me and 6ix9ine had Trippie Redd bitch on the couch
She was giving us a threesome, nigga
[Chorus]
Why you bring my name up in the first place, Tory? (Yeah)
You ain't fucking with me on my worst day, Tory (Uh)
Wasn't better than me when I was in first grade, Tory
We can do this every year on your birthday, Tory (Brrrat)
Every summer, every winter, every Earth day, Tory
Every Tuesday, every Thursday, Tory
It's gon' be a motherfucking anniversary, Tory
You done fucked up, now you need first aid, Tory

So now that we got that out the way, hmph

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Joyner, woo, woo
Ayo I'm tired of this fucking beat
Ayo, how many of y'all niggas
How many of y'all niggas gotta do this beat?
I'm gonna kill this fucking panda, man
I'm done

[Chorus]
I'm tired of this fucking panda song, I don't stand alone
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw
Burn 'em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke 'em, beat 'em, put a couple hammers on 'em
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on 'em

[Post-Chorus]
Kick him, punch him, throw him, make him slam the wall
Tie him to a cannon, make him a cannon ball
Into the ocean, make him suffer too
Nigga, this is fucking animal abuse
Animal cruelty on the fucking news
I'ma kill the panda 'til he bloody, too

[Verse 1]
I'll make him black and blue, fuck the black and white
I don't fuck with niggas like a pack of dykes
Eat the panda bitch, I got an appetite
I'm out this world, I swear that I'm a satellite
How many rappers gotta try to pay me?
Tired of hearing niggas on the same beat
Time to kill the panda in my old pajamas
Flying to Atlanta in the same week
What's a panda to a fucking polar bear?
A gorilla to a monkey, tiger to a puppy
Lion to a kitten, wolf to a pigeon
Shark to a fish and snake to an infant?
Alligator in the water wet
Joyner Lucas to a dinosaur and pet
They ain't know that I'm Tyrannosaurus Rex
Cut the panda up and rip apart his neck
I ain't doing interviews and autographs
I don't like the way you talking all of that
I should fuck your bitch and never call her back
I'd go down in history as an artifact but...

I'm tired of this fucking panda song
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw

Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on 'em

Kick him, hit him, make him slam the wall
Tie him to a cannon, make a cannon ball
Into the ocean, make him suffer too
Nigga, this is fucking animal abuse
Animal cruelty on the fucking news
I'ma kill the panda 'til he bloody, too

[Verse 2]
That's a bloody mess, that's a bloody death
Tell them niggas hating on me, ""suck a dick""
I ain't satisfied until I get to smash J-Lo and give her ass a couple kids
I’ve been on Animal Planet, I got my hands on the phantom
I kill it again, and nobody gotta hand me a Grammy
Goddamnit, I bet they don’t even want to hear what they planning
I see another Panda again and then I blam with the hammer
The man with a plan, you looking at the man in the mirror
The man with a killer that drill a nigga straight in the building
I hang with the realest, I really wanna handle my business
I get it, I get in, I gotta get it, damn it, I did it
I’m out of this commodity, ‘bouta be outta there
Hotter than riding inside of a driver seat at Leh and Ladakh
How did we get out of them out of a prodigy, nigga?
All I ever wanted was to hit the lottery, nigga
All eyes on me and they gotta be, nigga
Swear to God, 2Pac could be proud of me nigga
All I know is the fire burning inside of me, nigga
All I ever could be is real as I gotta be, nigga
But why you all wanna act hard?
Where I'm from, we get it popping in the backyard
Now everybody wanna run up on the back door
Half pussy, half bitch, you a cat-dog
Let me see you do the cat daddy on a black Caddy
Shorty got a fat fattie and flat belly
All she do is lap giving if she act petty, I'll kill a panda
Throw that nigga off a balcony for running his mouth to me
And y'all done got me mad, I'ma put the panda in a body bag
What you doing 'round here? Why you standing 'round?
Why you niggas tryna lollygag?
You ain't got a life and you proud of that?
All you wanna know is where the Molly at
All you hoes think about is Prada bags
I done killed the panda, where Desiigner at? Nigga
But this is not a diss, don't call it that
I'm just giving all you pandas hepatitis
Cancer, HIV and a heart attack
All you broke bitches need to call a cab
'Cause I ain't- ha-ha-ha
Yo, stop rapping over this goddamn beat
'Cause I ain't too fond of that, look
[Chorus]
I'm tired of this fucking panda song
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw
Burn 'em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke 'em, beat 'em, put a couple hammers on 'em
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on 'em

1930925,Joyner Lucas,Ross Capicchioni,"65 ContributorsRoss Capicchioni Lyrics[Verse 1]
Woke up at 7, my day seemed more than I prayed for
Got dressed up to head out and ride to school on my skateboard
New kid in class I sat alone takin' notes while the hoodlums were makin' jokes at the clothes that my momma paid for
Seemed like everyone was a part of some gang invasion
Tattoos, the initiation, parolers I’m on probation
Soakin' up the vibe as I study for information
'Cause lately I been deprived of a normal day
But today, on my way to eat lunch, some kid approached me
He told me “we should be cool” if only he got to know me
'Cause on this side of town I would need some protection
It’s crazy, reckless and dangerous
Unless I’m some sort of gangster, I’m only safe with the police
He said his name was [blank]
I dapped him up at the busses
I was kinda skept' about him at first cause I didn’t trust him
The more I got to know him, I couldn’t tell what his motives were
Hopin' that he was sincere, somethin' told me “let go”
But the only thing on my mind was patience
Searchin' twice for a different life, I was tired of waitin'
'Cause me and [blank] had similar views and conversations infused with knowledge
Mainly 'bout school and college, that was my truth, but regardless
He was type cool when I was wit' him
Introduce him to my family, they were rockin' wit' him
My momma told him, “Make sure you look out for my son”
And before she could finish her sentence, he quickly just interjected and said, “Don’t you even stress it, I got it under control.”
It’s been two months since we met, it seemed like we’d gotten close
Some cat approached me and tried to beef wit' me, I just froze
Then I see [Blank] pounded and stompin' homie right out his clothes
Called me his brother and told me he got me to the fullest
Even if that mean bullets, bullies, gangs, AKs and choppas ‘till they kill us
That’s the realest shit I ever witnessed
A few weeks later, my uncle sold me a Honda Civic
A ’93 with no license plates and no registration
Just thinkin' about every place that I’ma go when I finally get it
And then he asked me for a ride around the block some distance from where I was parkin
And instantly I knew the spot was sketchy, my momma would kill me
My intuition told me not to, I knew it was wild
And plus I knew I had no business or place on that side of town
And I read about some chick that went lurkin' without a sound and got murked
Her body found in that dirt, with a thousand rounds
It was worse than abandoned buildins of bandits, villians, and scammers
Killers provokin' gangsters, but maybe I’m overthinkin'
Maybe I might be straight just as long as I pump the brakes
And try not to think about it just trust I’ll be fuckin' safe
And then I told him, “Let’s go, hop in.”
He dapped me up, he started tellin' jokes the whole ride there
Had me crackin' up
As we were gettin closer, I felt funny, my stomach turned
Then he told me, “Go left, make another turn, go right, and drive slow”
As I look, it was all abandoned and quiet, not a single person in sight, nobody standin
And right when I pulled the car to the side
He said, “Right here, sit still. Turn the car off and chill.”
That’s when I start to panic he told me, “Relax.”
Then he pulled the keys out the ignition and hopped out and laughed
Then my life flashed in an instant
He inched to my driver door then I tried to lock it, I couldn’t
Ripped me right outta my seat and then grabbed the side of his jeans and then
Pulled out the shotty and all I heard was a screech and he shot my arm into pieces
I’m thinkin' I must be dreamin’, another shot to my chest
And my stomach’s squeezin', my breath or my lungs collapsin
I’m down on my fuckin knees askin' him, “Why?”
He looked at me, I looked him dead in the eyes
And he smashed my face with the barrel
And I throw my teeth to the sky and then uh
I heard a [cocks shotgun] sound of the shotty cock back
He pressed it hard against my head and blew my fuckin top back
I’m still conscious, I’m breathin'
I’m still movin', no clue as to why I’m not dead
All this blood that I’m losin' and I heard my car drive off
And I looked up and saw the sun and that was all that I saw
Then I heard my conscience tell me, “Get up nigga get up! You’re losin' blood, oh my! Don’t fall asleep or you’ll die! Stay awake and move as much as possible, there’s no time! Find some help or try to yell, you ain’t too well, oh God! Wake up, nigga! Wake up! Wake up, nigga! Wake up…”

Woke up at 7, my day was worse than I prayed for
Got dressed, then head out, down the stairs from the eighth floor
New kid in class, he sat alone, takin' notes while my niggas were makin' jokes
At the clothes that his mama paid for
Had no family, but was cool with the local gangstas
Tattoos, and now I’m on parole and probation for breakin' rules
That life was all I knew, all I wanted was to do was cruise
Smoke weed and say, “Fuck school”
Wanted guidance cause all my role models I would look up to
Was indicted a young dude with no logic
I went to church 'till the pastor said, “Fuck you.”
Now I’m violent and this gang that always looked out for me
Vouched for me and adopted me said they wanted to rock wit me
And I wanted to get down, guess there was somethin' missin'
Everything comes with a price, “There’s only one condition:
All you gotta do for initiation is kill an innocent victim and leave em there with no witnesses or no snitches
If you do that, you’d be down with the clique and that’s for life so don’t you ever think you getting outta this shit""
I thought about it
Soakin' up the vibe as I study for information, tryna choose my victim, plottin' the weakest prey
But today on my way to eat lunch, I approached him
And told him we should be cool, if only I got to know him
Cause on this side of town, he would need some protection
It’s crazy reckless or If only, unless he some sort of gangster and he only safe with the police

Then the more he got to know me, he couldn’t tell what my motives were
Hopin’ that I was sincere, but little did he know I was tryna snake him and pop a brick
Just need the perfect opportunity, I’m tired of waitin’
A murder runnin’ through my head, I knew that death was comin’
He introduced me to his family, I was jealous of him
His momma told me “Make sure you look out for my son-“
And before she could finish her sentence I quickly just interjected and said
“Don’t you even stress it. I got him to the fullest, even if that means bullets, bullies, gangs, AKs and choppas till they kill us.”
I was lyin to the fuckin’ limits
Took advantage when he said he had that Honda Civic
A ’93 with no license plates and no registration
Just thinkin’ about every place I’ma go when I finally kill him
And then I asked him for a ride around the block, some distance from where he was parked
And instantly I knew my chance was comin’, I’m ready to drill him

I dapped him up and started tellin jokes the whole ride there

As we were gettin’ closer, he felt funny
I think he knew somethin’ was comin’, that look he had was enough to tell me

[Verse 1]
I remember everything was different
When I tried to get a job and make some money, I was livin' on the street
I walked a lot of miles and nobody wasn't hiring
And I had to stand in line if I was to get something to eat
'Cause I ain't had no homies and my girl depended on me
Every night that we were lonely and I couldn't get no sleep
'Cause I was plotting on anybody I seen that was getting money
You got it? I need it sorry, you don't need it more than me
And bitch, I'm tired of this struggle, ducking and dodging them puddles
Wondering if God ever hear the prayers I said
'Cause every time I got a new hustle, that shit done got me in trouble
You don't know how many fucking tears I've shed
But fuck it, I'm letting loose, and they told me don't bend the rules
This is my winter blues, you know what I'm finna do
Anything necessary to make it up in the news
And I'm taking every mothafucking thing that I pick and choose
And I'm done with all the begging, I'm past that, all I did was get laughed at
You can go back track but you'll never get cash back
And they told me I'm half black, but I'm white as a lab rat
With a mic and a gas mask, I'm a light for your trash ass
And I might get the last laugh, better fight if you back stab
With a knife in your backpack, all my life I've been jabbed at
But I fight like I'm Mad Max with a knife with the yeah, yeah
You know, you know what the fuck I'm talking about
Listen, I don't give a fuck about your feelings
You don't have any idea just what I had to do to get what I want
All I wanted was to make a decent living

Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace

[Brief Message]
You know, you really piss me off sometimes
I spent all night waiting for you to come home
And I've woken up without you
I don't know where you are or why you're not answering your phone
But I'm starting to get worried
I really hope you're not pissing away the last of our money
At the stupid casino again
Because you know my next check won't be here 'til the third
And we literally have nothing right now
If you did go to the casino and you have more money, then I guess

[Verse]
Get the, fuck, off, of my, dick, ho, fuck you mean? (Woo)
I don't think you notice what you done to me (Yeah)
Yeah I think you should know that you are under me
If anybody got a problem, tell 'em they can come to me
What the fuck you mean? This is not allowed (Ayy)
Better calm it down (Woo)
Cause all you new niggas just watered down
I can see through you like a muh'fuckin' ultrasound, woo!
Okay, be ready to hold up then, I'm ready to roll up on them
I'm ready to mow them, make your motor spin
I'll blow the boat up then be gone and wonderin' what you noticin'
A couple of hoes that I've been boning since a nigga was only ten
I'm tryna to get all up in that pussy harder than my youngin' (Woo)
You fallin' and you love it (Yeah)
Can't stand the heat but you all up in the oven (Sha)
I remember when I used to ball on a budget
(Hol' up) Now wait a minute (Woah)
You finally got some paper, couldn't wait to get it (Yeah)
And it don't really matter 'cause you're still lame
No matter how much cake you got, it wouldn't make a difference (Don't matter)
I'm tired of all you rappers wantin' free verses
The fuck up outta here, this how I make a livin' (This how I make a livin')
I dive up in that pussy like Jamaican niggas (Bumbaclot)
I spend all of my dollars on some Laker tickets (Yeah)
I think if I die young, they gon' miss me too
I think I'ma buy guns, maybe empty two (Bla, bla, bla)
I think I'ma sell drugs to the kids at school
I think I'ma get buzzed if it gets me through
I think I'ma need to hide if they know where I live (Yeah)
I think I'ma drink and drive til' I total the whip (Woah)
I think I'ma get high, give her all of the dick
Even if she ain't mine so she knows what it is, wait (She know what it is)
(She know what it is) Hold up though, I'm ready to roll up on them
I'm ready to mow them, make your motor boat
I blow the boat up then be gone, I'm wonderin' what you notice though
A couple of hoes that I've been bonin' since a nigga was on it though
My nigga, what's your worst fear? I been running from the start
Scared to be a man, tryna hustle in the dark
Running down the stairs, gotta hustle every March
Eating supper, getting filled, watching ""Rumble in the Bronx""
I slip inside into the puddle of your heart
Nigga I don't trust you plus you never play the part
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, nigga
(Hol up, hol up) I said
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, hold up
(Hol up, hol up) Mm
I been living in the (wait wait)
Yeah, look
Get the, fuck, off, of my, dick, bi-, wait a minute (wait a minute)
I'ma fuck your bitch to let my neighbor hit it (neighbor hit it)

Keep the big strap on me like a hitman (Brra)

I ain't never been shit, ain't shit changed (Shit changed)
But niggas get lame when you get fame (Brra)
Can't sleep at night 'til I get brains
Got a mean ass pipe and a dick game

[Bridge]
I got a bitch on my sofa (Sofa)
I got a chip on my shoulder (Shoulder)
You gotta live with your karma
And if you get hurt then you got what you supposed to (Boom)

Uh
What if I told you that I was different?
What if I told you that something's missin'?
And what if I told you we're not alike
And the way that I feel inside is different than what you picture
What if I told you I feel divided?
Keep to myself and I'm awfully quiet
And what if I told you I been conflicted by my own thoughts
Trapped in the dark, and I tried to hide it
No, I'm not a slave to no fuckin' fairy tale
I bet you think that you know me very well
Make no mistake, this is not a cry for help
'Cause I don't owe no one no explanation on how I feel

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
But on the real, what if I told you that I was brave?
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?

What if I told you I'm not alright?
I mean, I don't feel dead, but I'm not alive
And what if I told you, ""I'm not like you""
And the shit I've been goin' through, it'll prolly make you cry
And what if I told you, ""I'm not this""
And the person you think you know don't exist
Look, I'm not who you know, I'm not who you wish
I'm not who you want me to be, what you want from me isn't this
I grew up in church where I couldn't be myself
I felt like a prisoner, couldn't leave my cell
They told me, ""God don't like ugly,"" and this an ugly world
And if I ever seen things different, then I would burn in hell

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
And on the real, this is not new, this is not a phase
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?

[Verse 3: Eminem]
What if I told you I'm homophobic?
And you have zero control over your impulses
And the genetic flaw in your chromosomes is the culprit
It's something I can't sugarcoat, it's repulsive
We were homies, since children, I thought it
But thought I was buggin', though
'Cause we'd sit, chill and just talk chicks
Now how can we be friends still after all this
Unless, I can convince you to repent
Ask God to forgive you for your sins
And begin healin' your conscience
And rid you of this sick illness that causes it
Part of me wishes you'd kept this shit, still in the closet
I'm white but I'm gettin' mixed feelings like Logic
Yeah, I'm pissed off a little, this is a choice
We were supposed to be boys
You're actin' like this ain't optional
What if I said you was weak?
'Cause you don't got the strength to conquer some biological monster that's part of you
That's responsible for them homosexual thoughts
If you don't want a lecture, part
Like a sofa section or long as you
Make your decision and stand by it, but I can't be beside it
'Cause for me, that'd be next to impossible
Or you learn to control your urges
You say, ""It's like pullin' teeth and morals are oral surgeons""
But how would you even know anyways if you're a virgin
Why can't you be a normal person?
What if I tried steerin' you towards a girlfriend?
Wouldn't work, would it? You seem pretty surefooted
I'm sure good at judgin', but I have no right
I know goodbye seems cold, right?
Not even a flicker of hope like a strobe light
As I leave and I swear I stayed up that whole night
And no, I didn't know you would go right home and go take your own life
I ain't mean for that shit to happen, I said I won't cry
I let the best friend that I've ever known die
Alone, was gonna tell you the next day
I'm so sorry, I'm fightin' my own demons, I won't lie
They won't leave me alone, eating at my soul, this whole time
I've been tortured, imprisoned in my own mind
A born again Christian but Lord if you're listenin'
We might be headed for a collision
'Cause when I told my boy I couldn't support his decision
I was tryna make it seem like a choice, when it isn't
Can't be cured with a prayer to Saint Jude
What If I told you my wish never came true?
What if I'm a hypocrite who's afraid to just face truth? Wait
What if I told you I'm gay too?

Go
Buck, buck, buck

[Verse 1]
I think I was born inside a cabana
With diamonds and gold on top of the Phantom
Jesus told Mary, ""Go get me a hammer
I'll kill any nigga that try to get near him""
All of the angels were drinkin' tequila
And Michael was sleepin' with Dirty Diana
And now I can't look at the man in the mirror
My life is a movie and here is the trailer
I ain't no killer, but don't try to play me
I'm out of my pills and now I'm just crazy
I jumped out of Heaven 'cause Lucifer paid me
I needed the money to buy a Mercedes
I fucked a few bitches, I had me a baby
I hope that my son don't grow up to hate me
I'm out of my mind and no one can save me
I wish I—(Urgh)

[Chorus]
Back when a nigga was jobless, tryna get by
Plottin' on shootin' myself (Brruck, buck, buck)
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry
Think I was losin' myself (Brruck, buck, buck, buck)
I prayed to God, and promised if he made me rich
Then I'ma stay true to myself (Buck, buck, buck)
But fuck it, I lied, and now I just stare in the mirror
Like what did I do to myself? (Brruck, buck, buck, buck)
I think the old me died
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
All the damn promises, I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied

I told my girl I'll give her the world
Whatever she want, consider it done
Soon as I'm rich, I'll buy you a crib
And get you a whip, whatever you want
Promise my niggas, ""I'll give you a million
A couple of cars just so you can stunt""
Then I got famous, blew up my head
And fuck what I said, my nigga, I'm gone
Hop out the foreign and jump in the stretch
Life is a bitch, I fucked her to death
And how do I feel? I'm somewhat depressed
I'll probably get killed, but fuck it, I'm blessed
Nigga, I'm rich, I'm done with the stress
Now I got drip, and blood niggas sweat
They love when I trip, they want me in debt
Go choke on a dick and cut me a check
All of these meds done got me a fever
I wanted a chain but got me a Visa
I came in the game, just proppin' my feet up
You niggas is strange, you follow the leader
And me and my pistol like Martin and Gina
We plot on you niggas, I'm probably a schemer
I'm easy to hate, I'm harder to love
You say you don't trust me, I wouldn't either, woah
(I wouldn't either, woah)
[Pre-Chorus]
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated (Buck, buck, buck)
I locked myself in the room to hide all my demons (Buck, buck, buck)

[Verse 3]
I just put some gold Dayton's on my fuckin' Benzo
Hit the switches, told your bitch, ""Come fuck me 'cause I said so""
They say, ""Joyner, you done changed, you done lost your mental
You blew up and all that humble shit went out the window""
I ain't the same, I used to be different
They say that I changed, well, maybe you right
Maybe them pills the doctor prescribed me
Got me wantin' to kill, and maybe I might
Maybe my family upset 'cause I made it
'Cause no one expected that I would be famous
And just 'cause we blood don't mean we're related
I'm threatin' the plug, I'm not with the fake shit, I'm not with the— (I'm not with the—)
Grandma told me, ""Tone it down,"" I said, ""Bitch, I'm older now""
I ate at my auntie house, she think that I owe her now
Cashed my check, got paid again, make you's think I'm Oprah now
Took my girl to H&M, she told me, ""It's over now"" (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck)
[Pre-Chorus]
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated (Buck, buck, buck)
I locked myself in the room to hide all my demons (Buck, buck, buck)
I told my uncle to give me a loan 'cause I really needed it
""Soon as I'm on, I promise I'll pay you in full""
But (Buck, buck) I didn't mean it

If I weren't with you, I can't picture me with someone else
And every time we separate it's like we under spells
'Cause when we hurt each other we come back to help each other heal
You say I'm crazy, but at least you know my love is real
But shit, you crazy too, and that's why they say love is hell
And it's forever, so I hope you never up and bail
And if you ever left me for someone, you gon' get someone killed

And every time you try to leave, I'm chasin' after you (Chasin' after you)
And every time I go, I keep on comin' back to you (Comin' back)

Hella toxic, but I know that I'm determined
If we can make it through the fire, we can breathe inside a furnace (Facts)
Your family never liked me, they all think that I'm a burden
They know when we're together you're a different type of person (True)
Whenever things get bad, it never seems like it's worth it
It's like we're drownin' really fast until we get back to the surface
And we never learnin' self-love (Yeah)
So we been there for each other when no one else was (No one else was)
And all the times I was broke and you kept me held up
And got me back focused or held me down when I felt stuck (Word)

I've been goin' fuckin' fast and it got me swervin'
I know that I'm a child of God, but they want me cursed in
I've been trappin' out the Ozark, I'm Marty Byrdin' (Oh, oh)
And I've been hard at work, yeah, ho, you just hardly workin'
If it wasn't for this rap shit, I'd be movin' kilos
Front the pack from my connect then cop a few casinos
Used to fake it 'til I made it just to boost my ego
Stashin' money in my shirt, they thought I grew some chichos, oh no
I got some nеw wheels, uh-uh
Tired of kids, they think that we in school still, ah-ah
Play mе, you gon' find out how the tool feel, ah-ah
Fuck around and you gon' find out who's real, ah-ah
Who, yeah, ah-ah

Niggas been waitin' to hate it (True)
I got a Beamer and I'm anxious to race it
Vroom right past you (Vroom right past you)
Cops keep followin' a nigga, that's bad news

I might go back to my old ways, she want her soul saved
I done traded in my soulmate and got a gold chain
Okay
I came up way under-privileged, poverty livin' and I ain't had nothin' but scraps (Yeah)
I had to watch niggas winnin' and drivin' in foreigns and I was just stuck in the back (Word)
I had to learn me the bidness so once I applied it, I made me a couple of racks (Yeah)
I had ménages with Nicki and Cardi and Megan and then I woke up from a nap
Ooh (Ooh)
I had a Bugatti and then I woke up in the trap (Yeah)
I had a couple of friends I left in the past 'cause they don't do nothin' but cap (Yeah)

I crush them inevitably, and leave them as dead as can be
That go to any nigga who's steppin' to me, they all come second to me
My words are weapons to me- I burn it, second degree
And get it, and I'm sicker than any nigga that's sick, and I got it sick and it shiverin'
Even Ritalin couldn't get rid of the kid in him
You gotta be kiddin', I'm trippin', I kinda feel like a kid again (Rah, rah, rah)
And, yeah, I got somethin' to say
I ain't with the games, I ain't come to play
Nigga, you confused, you a broad, go tuck your leg
You trapped in the wrong body like Young M.A (Buck, buck)
I need my money like andale
Got a one-inch blade, get cut then we run that fade
I ain't really with the dumb ass shade

Don't you stare me down, you know I'm rude
Why the fuck you looking at me like you so confused?
You really make me sick my nigga if you only knew
I swear to God I wish you wasn't born and there was no excuse
Cause I don't want to raise you
I really fucking hate you
I wish I ain't have to take you, I ain't trying to educate you
Yo, this really fucking sucks, and your mothers fucking nuts
I had my whole life figured out, leave it to you to fuck it up
Man shut the fuck up! What you crying for?
Looking at me like you love me
What you lying for?
Why you want to try me for?
Blow your fucking candles out
Enjoy that cake I got you, for your stupid little birthday that everyone's so excited for
Except me
Shit I dare you to disrespect me when you grow up
That's gonna be the last time you ever swell up
Fuck you thought
Everything was perfect, now its fucking lost
And its all your fault
Happy Birthday Nigga

Sometimes I wanna kill myself so I don't have to deal wit' you
I know it sounds harsh but I'm just being real wit' you
And I ain't looking forward to none of that father shit
I ain't got time for that type of shit
And your mom ain't gonna like this
But we ain't
Shooting no hoops
Flying kites
We ain't riding bikes
I hope you get your ass beat
I ain't teaching you how to fight
I ain't here to kiss you goodnight
I don't care to give you advice about girls
I hope you get your heart broken for dear life
I fucking hate you!...
And I know that its wrong
Sometimes I wanna explain but I don't know where to start
Cause you won't understand even if I told you my thoughts
Cause even when its light
I feel like i'm alone and its dark
My mind keeps racing fast
I can't bear with this pain I have
I can't stand you
And I hate the fact that you just a mistake
And that's just what the fuck you was
Everything was perfect
Now its fucking lost
And its all your fault
Happy Birthday Nigga
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Shit I wanted to be a father so bad, I would give it all
Just to have my baby sit in my arms while I'm holding on
And to feel that beautiful feeling of love for my first born
Even play you the first song, that you hear when you first come
I loved your fucking mother so much I would give my heart
To be down to death do us part
Till I drown in a fucking pond, till I burn in a blazing building
Apartment fire with bombs
Till I crash a Mercedes car, by a drunk drive on broad
With seven heaters on me
And then she fucking cheated on me
Drinking with her friends and they didn't wanna leave the party
Got drunk and had sex, I ain't even see it coming
And then we find out she was pregnant, and she keeping secrets from me
This don't make sense and I felt my fucking heart cave in
The baby not mine, the paternity test came in
And the love is gone
Everything was perfect, now its fucking lost
And its all your fault

I been snatchin' purses while I'm rapping in the back of churches
I'm a backwards person, I ain't laughin' don't you act absurd
And I've been havin' urges, ain't no passion
Don't you bastards think you bad at cursin'
I've been bad since birth, been slapping nurses asses
Takin' percs and I've been urgin' to get served in action
Got a nervous itchin' in a serpents kitchen drinking Captain's
While I'm servin' children, different words that's spillin' out the cabinets
In a hurt position this absurd addiction got me laughin'
Spit faster, runnin' with impact 'til your wrists cramp
And break your kit-kat while you play with your kids back
I'm Chris Hansen

[Verse 1 Reversed]
Laughin' at addiction,, absurd, in this position
Hurt inside a cabinet, spillin' out words that's fairly different
Servin' children while the captain's drinking in a serpent's kitchen Itchin' from a nerve in action, got served while takin' percs
Ass nurses slappin' since birth, and I've been cursin' bad you
Think you bastards think you got passion, but ain't no urge you havin'
Been absurd action, don't be laughin', ain't no person backwards
I'm at churches in the back rappin' while I'm purses snatchin, nigga

[Verse 2]
I been chasin' rappers down with pencils, paper books, and stencils
Writin' verses while I pack the pistols in the back of rentals
I wrote my dad's initials, then laughed and then passed it in to, I been half demented breaking shit down to half a sentence
I been half demented, breaking shit down to half a sentence
Fuck the rap Olympics, I murdered the past contenders
I cooked their ass and grill 'em, now you can eat that for dinner
And I used to laugh at niggas for actin' like fags with feelings
Till' I packed a gentlemen's packages filled with acid venom
I bought a toy gun with some bullets wit' plastic in them
Explosives with matches lit em' and left a few fragments in them
I never packed a mac in the back of a Ac(ura) or Sentra or
Lexus with gas unless it’s a Benz with a stack of Benjamins

The fragments lit matches explosives and plastic bullets from a gun toy I just bought for you niggas as y'all been reckless
Venom acid filled with them packages and I'm packagin' them
Faggots in they feelings just actin while niggas laughin'
Eatin dinner seized in the grill and cooked they asses, while contenders pass ‘em, murder Olympics, and rap past them
Sentence down, breaking dimensions in half essentials
I passed and laughed with the pencils I wrote in Dads initials
In the back of rentals I'm pistol packing a stack of stencils in the book, papers and pencils I'm rapper chasin' and-

I'm the same nigga that fizzled pop and got ratchet on them
Yeah that same nigga that took a piss in your Arizona
And that same nigga that put acetone in a bag a soap
And then sold it for $40 some pussy and half a soda
And I never paid attention to rappers who actin' bogus
Who lie and say they rich in their songs when their ass is homeless
Then tryna throw dirt on my name just to pass the quota
Till I grab it throw em', bash 'em and laugh when they ass is over
Fuck 'em hard go hustle hard with the hustlers
Cut they jugular so you choke on your tongue and jaw
And I never been a gangster or wanted no trouble, nah
But I'm good with my knuckles punch through a brick and leave dust and all

[Verse 3 Reversed]
All and dust, leave a brick punched with my knuckles, nah
But i'm nah, no trouble wanted, a gangster I never could

Cuttin' hustlers with the hustler hustle hard
Fuck 'em hard over ass laughin', I'm bashin' my back, fold 'em
Crack 'em till the quota, pass 'em and trash 'em, and laugh over 'em
Homeless ass when they songs trash, and crack closer
Bogus actors who rappin' over the track, hold 'em
Sold a half a pussy, a dollar forty, I sold it for some soap and acetone, and a bath and then blast Both 'em

2338907,Joyner Lucas,Jumanji,"49 ContributorsJumanji Lyrics[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Stompin all up in the rain
Hop up all up in the way
Elephants a couple lions and a zebra
Put the heater’s in your face
And leave you with the monkeys
A banana clip, it’s funny
Watch em pull apart your little face
And I've been in the jungle with the fucking apes
Tell em what i slay
Beast in a cage
Nigga this is what you call Jumanji
Ain't no new Bugatti's
Just a deuce deuce shotty
Big enough to make Bruce Bruce potty
Turnin' Bruce Jenner to a new hobby
I ain't cool with nobody
I don't trust a motherfucking soul nigga
Even let the grim reaper know nigga
Put it on my tombstone when I die here
Take a step inside of my world
27 years still ain't comfortable enough to call a bitch my girl
You are now looking at a monster
85 teeth, 39 deep, 26 piece
Run and light a fucking military with a M-16
Influenced by George Bush
Burn your whole city with a blowtorch
Then I ride out in a tour bus
And I hop out in a Porsche truck
Like blah
Black tie swagger
Black pride nigga
Black lives matter
Black eye shadow
Black nine barrel
Bang bang move back my nigga
Why lie?
Every night I pray to my god
I don't gotta wait to blah blah
And I never gave two caca's
I'm a heavyweight new prime time
In an MMA fight
With a Kimbo Slice for your neck
Then I put my fucking life in the script
It's a movie put my life in the shit
Pack a mag and we could get it crackalackin
Back when I was tryna make it happen-happen
Nothin' happened, nothin' ever shot at rapping
And if that doesn't happen I'ma stack it
Till I turn a pack into another pack
‘Til I sack it up to cap a captain
Big enough to put a fucking bomb inside it
And blow flames on a fire
Be the dragon
Bin Laden ain't got shit on me
I don't think you understand
You are really looking at the devil, nigga
I don't think you wanna dance
Meet me in the clouds and the smoke nigga
I hope nigga you ain't never stood a chance
You ain't never, you ain't never
Could've been should've been would've been
Look at him Joyner Lucas
Stompin' all up in your face
Poppin all up in the bass
Elephants, a couples lions, and a cheetah
But the heaters in ya face
And leave you with the monkeys
A banana clip, its funny
Watch 'em pull apart your little face
And I been in the jungle with the fucking apes
Hunters wanna slay beasts in a cave

So fuck you and your in-laws
Never grew up on Crenshaw
But I grew up on menthols
And I smoke till my fucking lungs squeeze
And I choke till my fucking tongue bleed
In the carpet of yo mom's crib
Till your tubs leaks on them love seats
And this must be what it feels like
When you full force and I'm dead right
And you dead wrong and I'm here like
With my hands wrapped around his like
Goddamn

The gorillas talking like a torpedo finna knock up on your fucking door frame
Not a problem you was just a floor stain
At the bottom of the ground i'm walking on
I betcha momma teach you not to talk a lot
I betcha ya dog'll teach you not to bark a lot

I don't wanna be nothin' like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be just like you
[Verse 1]
Look, I don't wanna be no fuck nigga
I don't wanna sell drugs, nigga
I don't ever wanna fuck mad hoes
And then claim I can't find love with 'em
I don't wanna be no super thug
I don't ever wanna get tripped up
I don't wanna get drunk and high
And spend all my time in the strip club
Look, I don't wanna ever go to jail and shit
Serve time and get bail and shit
Be a bum and start stealing shit
Fuck around and die and go to hell and shit
Yo, I don't wanna be jobless
And I don't wanna be heartless
Run around, tryna start shit
Pickin' fights, thinkin' I'm hot shit
Yeah, I don't wanna become vengeful
And I ain't into what you're into
Pray to God I don't run into
Someone just like you, my one issue
Hope one day, that shit does hit you
'Cause you so goddamn judgemental
And I don't wanna... look...

I don't wanna be caught just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be nothin' like you

[Verse 2]
Uh, I don't wanna be hopeless
A pretty girl with no focus
A single mom with like four kids
Never had much, never owned shit
And no school and no diplomas
Dropped out and don't know shit
Steady sticking my nose in on your business
Spreading rumors, uh
I don't wanna be chasing guys
Half ratchet, half sanctified
Giving all your friends lame advice
Always going out, can't stay inside, yeah
I don't wanna become trite
Content with my fucked up life
Little attitude, actin' uptight
Never had a clue, but I love fights
No, I don't wanna smoke cancer sticks
Going out every chance I get
I love the truth but can't handle it
Tryna cover bruises with bandages
But I hope one day, that shit does hit you
Cause you so damn judgemental
And I don't want...
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be nothin' like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be just like you

I don't wanna be caught just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be nothin' like you

[Verse 3]
I need someone to look up to
A role model I can run to
When I feel lost and I'm confused
And I'm out of touch with my young roots
I need confidence so that I can get
And I love you and your common sense
'Cause lately, I've been tryna live this thug life
And I'm not convinced
Look, I love how you handle your own
Glad you are the king to your own castle
You handle life when it's thrown at you
Never curl up, never faux fragile
I need you to be here, regardless
Teach me how to be there for my kids
Show me how to be fearless often
I need real guidance, I ain't scared of options
Because of you, I've got a clearer conscience
Because of you, I'm not scared of monsters
Because of you, I'm not afraid of failure
When life was blurry, you made it clearer
And God forbid, if you died now
I know that I'd be well taken care of
I know you'll be there waiting for me
[Outro]
I just wanna be just like you
I wanna be anything like you
I wanna be just like you

Ahh, shit
Joyner!

[Verse]
Yo, nigga's saying, ""What a great battle""
But you about to see a fucking snake rattle
Boy, you just a pony with a pink saddle
I'm truly sorry that you stuck inside of Drake's shadow
When are you gon' overcome? (Huh)
When are you gon' level up?
When are you gon' grow another foot? (Huh)
When are you gon' show us that you number one? (When)
And everything that you accomplished in some years about to take me just a couple months
Don't you think I'm bluffing neither
I thought you were tougher, eager (Damn)
How you almost signed to Justin Bieber?
You look like a fuckin' beaver (Haha)
Ten years in the game but yo' ass still sittin' on the fucking bleachers
Boy, you just another diva (Just another diva)
Heard yo' grandmama kicked you out the house screaming
""Tory, we don't fucking need you""
Why yo' daddy up and leave you? (Why)
I guess this is how they fucking treat you
And you my puppet, you my Cousin Skeeter
This ain't what you wanted, they been waiting for it
I'm Joyner Lucas, what the fuck you niggas take me for
(What the fuck)
I pull up in a Demon but I kill Satan for it
If you want attention Tory you gon' have to pay me for it
All these hoes love me but you sucker niggas hate me for it
You roll up on me, catch a shot at ya Mercedes door
The bullets fly, you recline like a La-Z-Boy
All you do is cry, you a child, you my baby boy
You call yourself Tory after The Notorious Big (Yeah)
Biggie turning in his grave when he hear yo' shit
Don't ever think that you could ever come compare yo' shit
Little girls and kids only ones who feel yo' shit
I skipped the plaques on my way to a Grammy
All your records soft and sweet, niggas think that you candy
Your niggas really convinced you that you think you can scare me
And you got identity issues, niggas think you a tranny, really? (Damn)
Tory tell us why you always gotta lie in your rhymes (Why)
I know keeping up with lies can get tiring sometimes
You not a G and deep down you wanna hide sometimes
Staring at the sunshine and start crying sometimes
Your real name is Daystar, you been dying to shine
And when you sing you kinda sound like you dying sometimes
You make the type of tracks that had me feelin' silent inside
Nobody take you serious, put all the violence aside
Okay, let's talk about your plagiarism that you hate to mention (Yeah)
Or talk about the hate you giving to the greats you dissing
(Let's talk about it)
And that writer who wrote yo' shit still ain't get paid on that ""Don't Die"" record
You should probably go pay the nigga (Yeah, man)
And how the fuck you talk about Kendrick when he a legend (Huh)
Then go bite the nigga style on your record right at the ending
On ""4AM Flex"" 2 minutes and 50 seconds
Sound exactly like ""The Art of Peer Pressure"", go take a listen
You inspired by the niggas you name dropped
Catch fire in the rain, no umbrella to shelter you and no rain drops
When I seen you on Flex, I gave props
But then we found out you stole Don Q shit from the train stop
You thought you were fly 'til the plane drop
Ugly motherfucker tryna stunt in a tank top
It's no wonder why they used to feed yo' ass with a slingshot
You my son, this the last time I'll give you a Ring Pop
Sit down, you on punishment
And don't get up until you see me
And don't even think about touching that TV
No more video games, no more phone, no more 3D
No more radio or boombox for your weak ass CD
Matter of fact, give me your chains back and everything I bought you
You a disgrace to this family and everything I taught you
I hate to say it son but you make me sick
I should'a knew you weren't shit when you came out with a baby dick
It's no wonder why you pay for pussy
Tory you think you slick
All you do is lounge around the house all day like a lazy prick
Shit, highly disappointed in you son, I need some answers
How come you couldn't follow in my steps and be a dancer?
Or maybe write a book like me or be somebody's grandpa
Instead you wanna be a fucking rapper with some hair plugs
No more rapping, give me your pen and paper
No more lying to the people on how you the biggest gangster
Now hurry up and get your juicy out the refrigerator
You going to bed at eight o'clock and not a minute later
No, I don't wanna hear it
No, let this be a lesson
Close your mouth and go into your room like I suggested
I'm a get real Joe Jackson in a second
Matter of fact, give me your toys, I'm adding that to the collection
I just did a show and got it lit ya little nigga
And my freestyles killing your originals nigga
Couldn't name a bitch I couldn't get ya little nigga
You a rebound, even Scottie Pippen know nigga
You ain't from Toronto, put that on the Bible
I put six hollows in your Ferragamo
Nigga, you from Brampton, go spin the bottle
Bitch I'm from New England, me and Brady in the El Dorado
Now come get on my level, I'm hard as metal
I bomb the ghetto, I brought the shovel
I bury all of you little ninja turtles
You Donatello, you soft as jello
You must be gone off that Amaretto
It's hard to tell 'cause you soft as pillows
You fucking midget, I call you Willow
I throw you out a fucking car window
I step all over your Margielas, you caught feelings
Yo' heart spinning, my bars illing
I'm Bob Dylan, I'm John Lennon, I'm authentic
Your bars running no off limits
Don't talk business, don't talk, listen
I'm off this so you fuck this you fuck! Nigga

Yo, I know you don't understand my words
But you will eventually
You will eventually, some day
One day

[Chorus]
I know you don't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older, I hope you don't hold this shit against me
I hope you understand I love you more than life itself
And this is nothin' but your daddy's thoughts when he was feelin' empty

[Verse 1]
And everything ain't always what it seems like on the outside
I fought so many tears so that you would never see the outcry
I never wanted kids until I lived and went through hard times
And became a man that fell in love with someone that my heart finds
But you know how that shit go, young and reckless, different women part time
And I wasn't ready for that life yet, I was in my dark prime
Me and your moms ain't get along and she gave me a hard time
I really think that we just crossed paths at the wrong time
I wasn't happy when she said she was pregnant
Probably the worst news of my life, that shit was so depressing
I told her she should get an abortion and I really meant it
I'm sorry that I said that shit, yo I was trippin'

I know you don't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older, I hope you don't hold this shit against me
I'm sorry, yo

[Verse 2]
And I never wanted a broken home to raise you from a distance
Yeah I'll admit it, I was scared of that type of commitment
Even hopes of a miscarriage, anything bad that could happen
That'd get me out of that situation, I was livid
I felt like shit about my thoughts, that wasn't me, I'm different
Plus I was dealing with some demons that I couldn't live with
I told her she should get an abortion and I really meant it, damn

[Chorus]
I know you don't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older I hope you don't hold this shit against me
Hope you don't hate me, I was selfish, I hope you forgive me
I hope you forgive me (please forgive me)

[Verse 3]
And I still remember your baby shower like, it was yesterday
And to your mom it was special, me, just another day
I wish that you could see the pictures, all the fake phony smilin'
Had to pretend that I was happy, deep down I was cryin'
Ma asked if I was okay, I turned around and looked away
I was dryin' all my tears, look back to say ""Yeah""
I was lyin', goddamn, how the hell I get here?
This is it, this supposed to be my life, this ain't how I pictured it
I never felt so damn alone, but it was more than often
One of the worst days of my life, and I ain't even lyin'
We argued when we came home, I blame myself for all this
I think that I was holding a grudge cause she ain't get an abortion
I'm sorry (fuck) damn
[Chorus]
And I know you can't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older, I hope you don't hold this shit against me
I can't believe I tried to hurt you, I hope you forgive me
Please, please

[Verse 4]
And everything ain't always what it seems like on the outside
I fight so many tears so that you would never see the outcry
I sacrificed my life so you could live it, peace
Want to give you things my father couldn't give to, me
I think I was raised wrong and that's just what it is to me
And if you ask him then his ass gon' probably disagree
But whatever, whatever...
And nothing's ever made me cry as much as you, I swear
Your smile gives me motivation and some new ideas
My worst fear is always you not knowing who I am
Cause I been on the road dreamchasing for you out here
I was the first thing that you opened your eyes to
And the last one that you said goodnight to
I went home and cried to
And I bawled my eyes out and then watched you
Glad I got you, that's a blatant fact
And every negative thing I said I swear I take it back

[Chorus]
I know you don't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older, I hope you don't hold this shit against me
I hope you understand I love you more than I love myself
And this is nothin' but your daddy's thoughts when he was feelin' empty
I was feelin' empty, I been feelin' empty
I put my emotions in this music when I'm feelin' empty
I hope you forgive me
Please, please

4659849,Joyner Lucas,Broke and Stupid,"55 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishBroke and Stupid Lyrics[Intro]
First, we're affected by what we know
When I talk to the kids in high school classes, college classes, that's the first thing I tell 'em
Get the information while you're here
Like nothing worse than being stupid when you get out of school
So get the information, being broke is bad
But being stupid is what's really bad
And what's really, really bad is being broke and stupid

[Verse 1]
Uh, this the shit I dreamed about when I was only four
Sugar, water, mac and cheese, we were broke and poor (Yeah)
Court evictions, landlords never showed remorse
Now I'm in the building, when they greet me, they gon' hold the door (Yeah)
I never needed your acceptance, this is my destin'
I made devil's work and turned it into God's blessings
Can't knock me off the block, this is not Tetris
Life lessons, I learned tables turn, that's my assessment
They told me to be patient, but I need to flex (Woo)
I'm so famous, I can finally hit JAY-Z direct (Yeah)
I might hit up Drake and tell him to send me the jet (Shoo)
I might drink Cîroc with Puff if he send me a check (Word)
Lot of squares in my family, I could see the stress
Bunch of crabs in the bucket tryna eat my flesh
I ain't nothing like you niggas, I don't even rest
I don't sleep until I see success, I wish you the best (Joyner)
I ain't on no hating shit, I just wanna get rich (Word)
I don't do relationships, I don't wanna commit
Lot of bitches did me dirty, ain't talk to me since
And now I'm insecure, closed off, but that's hard to admit (Word)
I'm just thinking 'bout the days that were making me jealous
Can't rain on my parade when I'm made of umbrellas (Woo)
Fuck it, it don't faze me, I don't stay in my feelings
Thought money would change me, but it changed all my niggas (Facts)
I just bought a Lamborghini and painted the ceiling
I ain't bragging, I'm just happy I made me a million
ADHD, I was slow, now they label me brilliant
I'm proud of niggas like Hov, he made him a billion (Yeah)
I hope I never go broke tryna break through the ceilings
Fifty thousand on the low, I might make an appearance (Yeah)
This that shit that made them kids run away from they parents
Nigga, I'm breaking your spirit (Woo)
I told myself if I go out, then I'ma light my wrist (Boom)
If I die today, I'm happy for the life I live (Blah, blah)
And my son is only three, he be like, ""Mama rich""
Told him go outside and play, just be inside by six (Ayy)
I done made my niggas proud, you ain't gotta love me
Give a fuck about your opinion, only God could judge me
I don't even write on paper, I just write on Tully (Woo)
I might hire an assistant, make her write it for me (Ayy)
This is me against the world, that's the mood I'm in (Goddamn)
Hop up out the fucking pussy like I'm new again (Woo)
I remember they was calling me a hooligan
In special education, I just might go back to school again, woah
Only hit it once, then I make her leave (Woo, woo)
We ain't cuddlin', I need some space to breathe (Woo, woo)
If she fuck me good, I let her stay 'til three (Woo, woo)
No, I'm not your man, but we can make believe
Okay, you got an ass, that don't mean a thing to me
Stop acting like a brat, bitch, I ain't Jermaine Dupri (Woo)
These pussy niggas talkin' 'bout what they gon' say to me
And they gon' beat me up, I told 'em that's some shit I'd pay to see

And what's really, really bad is being broke and stupid
Nothing much worse than that unless you're sick
Like sick, broke, and stupid, that's
About as far as you can fall unless you're ugly, right?
But surely that would be the ultimate, right?
The ultimate negative life, ugly, sick, broke, and stupid

[Verse 2]
I turned my life into a movie, bitch, I think I'm Rocky
I can't even wear my jewelry now, they think I'm cocky (Ayy, ayy)
I know that I got myself if I ain't got nobody
Just bought a pistol, I just hope that it ain't got no bodies
You gon' have to pay the price if you get wishy-washy (Woo)
This a Talladega Night, I think I'm Ricky Bobby
My advice, quit the music, get a different hobby
All you lil' niggas sound the same, just a different copy, woah
And I bow my head and pray for this (Woo, woo)
Yeah, I spilled my guts and made a mess (Woo, woo)
Shit, I ran on Mars and made a wish
Yeah, I stand on cars like Jaden Smith (Yeah)
And I ball so hard, I sprained my wrist
If I shoot it, then I ain't gon' miss
Loyal nigga, so I ain't gon' switch (Woo)
Blew my money at the strippy, it don't make no sense
Broke and stupid, shit'll never be the same again

Hey, let me clarify something for you
You're looking at a lot of fucking time
So this is completely up to you
We can do this the easy way (Snitch)
Or we can do it the hard way (Snitch)
I need some fuckin' information (Snitch)
And I need it right now (Snitch)
[Verse]
This your motherfuckin' conscience, nigga, don't even do it
Don't start actin' like a bitch 'cause you forgot where you goin'
You made choices that done put you here, and now you just ruined
And I don't care about why you did it or who got you influenced
Nah, don't listen to that nigga, that ain't good advice
If you cooperate, then it's your chance to save your life
Just tell 'em what thеy wanna know and you won't pay the price
Some would call it snitchin', but for mе, I call it make it right
Man, fuck that ""make it right"" shit, you gotta sit through your bid
You should've thought about this shit before you did what you did
Give a fuck about your family or your bitch or your kids
You either gon' respect the code or your gon' get what you give
Who gives a fuck about the codes? No one follow codes
We both know that jail ain't the place you wanna go
Somebody fuckin' on your bitch, you tryna call her phone
If I was you, I'd tell them boys everythin' they wanna know
Pssh, okay, let's think about this, let's embrace it
Let's make an illustration
Let's say you switch up with it and bitch up and then make a statement
Now niggas in jail, that nigga ain't tellin', had no snitch temptations
Now you might be free, but you might get killed for givin' up information
And if you don't get killed, then that's a wrap, everybody gon' know you as a rat
Won't get no respect for the rest of your life, nobody wanna know you after that
You might just run, but you never could hide, how long you hopin' that'll last
'Fore they catch you slippin' and give you somethin' that you know you had to have?
Fuck that, let's say you keep your mouth shut and take the blame for it
Now you need money on your books, ain't no one payin' for it
No visitations or no letters you've been waitin' for
That pussy you've been cravin' for, you may not get laid no more
And all them niggas that you call your brothers'll be ghost
The only one who got you is your mother if you close
A bunch of niggas screamin' ""free you"" and makin' posts
No one show up to your trial, niggas pray that you get smoked
Man, please tell me you ain't 'bout to take this sucka's advice
Your kids'll grow up knowin' that you just a sucka for life
Lackin' morals and integrity, it come with a price
And if you fold, then you should know that we ain't nothin' alike
And if you leavin' here tonight, you better cop a burner
Don't fuck around and be somebody ain't nobody heard of
Now here's your choice, be a man or be somebody murdered
It's either you can take the stand or you'll be Bobby Shmurda
Free Bobby Shmurda (Shmurda, Shmurda, Shmurda, Shmurda)

Damn, this is not alright
How the fuck I end up on the other side of life?
No more hangin' with my friends, no more ridin' bikes
No more brushin' barbies hair, no more flyin' kites
No more school, no more learnin' for me
No more youth, no more juice
No more hula hoops or Suzy Q's
Wish I could kiss my momma bye (Joyner)
And if she ever see me like this, she'll be traumatized
No this is not alright, but nothing is (shit)
I barely got to live, I'm just a kid
Look at me, look what you fuckin' did
I'm fuckin' dead (damn)
No this wasn't even my fault, now I'm speaking with the lights off
I don't think they hear me
It ain't no more TV, no more dancin'
No more sleepovers or no candy, no more campin'
No more kisses from my daddy 'cause I left and died
All because this stupid bitch wanted to text and drive

[Chorus: Jade Novah]
Smash time, watch the glass fly
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah

Auto pieces, oil leakin', drippin' gasoline
Door is open, windows broken, glass shattered dreams
Holy bibles, open beer bottles at the scene
Now look at us
No more comin' home from work and cookin' dinner for my man
No more prayin' for my sins, no more stuntin' on the 'Gram
No more Thanksgiving holidays or pictures with the fam
No more vacation plans to everywhere I've never been
It's all gone now
Look what you did (look what you did)
Damn
I should have never got inside your car
I should have stayed at home or just went shoppin' at a different store
I should have waited or just called an Uber, but I live too far
No more tantrums and ain't no more questions, no more answers
No more homework with my daughter, no more second chances
No more baby in my belly, sad to say we died
All because you choose to drink and drive
Why?

3095181,Joyner Lucas,Keep It 100,"61 ContributorsKeep It 100 Lyrics[Intro]
Keep it a 100
Uhh, yo

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me money rules the world, I know you heard that shit
Money the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit
I slaved away for ten hours a day at work and just finally got my check
But the ATM isn't working, shit
Oh, there it go (oh oh oh oh oh) damn, it's hot as hell
Punched in a pin code and grabbed a hundred dollar bill
I snatched it up and went back to my wheels
Hit up the plug and said ""I know you got some bud, I need that with some pills""
Meet me outside the gas station on Park Ave, I'll be waiting
Then put the cash in the glove compartment as I sat waiting
Damn, yo where's this nigga at?
Bout to light a cigarette while I-, oh, there he go
Opened up the glove compartment, told em to light this
Come around and drive inside and act normal like we ain't making a transaction
Take that (what up, what up?) I dapped him up and got to sliding
He crinkled it up, walked off then put it in his pocket
Off to the strip club with some drinks and some orders
He pull that hundred out his pocket, uncrinkled the corners
Stageside, watching this one bitch shaking and twirling
Busted it open all exotic and maybe she's foreign
She making eye contact, she got on eye contacts
She sees that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that
She's thinking ""I want that"", he takes a sip from his glass
She bend over, he slaps her ass and puts some ones in her crack
He whispered in her ear ""How long are you here? Tell me you single
Oh, you got a man? Fuck, I don't care, tell him I'm queer
Save my name as Susan in your contacts, hm
And fuck your relationship, I ain't worried about that, heheh
Can I use that red marker, sir?
Let me write my number on this hundred for you
Make sure you hit me up when your boyfriend can't do nothing for you
(508)-507-2209""
She got home and opened her purse as soon as she gets to the door
Counting them dollars, smoking tree while she sit on the floor
I don't think she like how this shit make her feel
But you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills
For real, she wanna get high now, uhh
Grab the Benjamin off the floor, she feeling alive now, uhh
Few grams of coke on the table, that's the right now, uhh
She rolled a hundred up and stuck it up her nose like
That's what she call Heaven's door
That's what she call Snow White, the white without seven dwarfs
She throw a hundred back at her purse and headed down to the store
She needed blunts for the gas, she needed gas for the Ford
She needed eggs and some dill, she needed cheese and some milk
She needed change

""What what number is that?
I said what number is that on the bill, what is that?
Yes, in red, it's like a phone number
What is this? Never mind""

[Verse 2]
""Aye aye, don't you make one mothafucking move
Empty that register, I know you don't need my help
Hurry the fuck up, look, don't make me repeat myself
Gimme the cash, follow instructions, don't be fucking moving
Cause I'd hate to kill you over something stupid
Now hand me the bread and place your hands on top of your head
Take my tough advice
Turn around and count to a hundred if you love your life""

[Refrain]
Now keep it a 100
Uhh, keep it a 100
Yeah, keep it a 100
One hundred
Keep it a 100

[Verse 3]
Yo, somebody told me money rules the world, I know you heard that shit
Money's the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit
He put that hundred inside of collection plate on Sunday too
Hope that it'll take away your sins, maybe someday soon
But anyway, they covered the plate and just continued praying
After church, the pastor opened it up and started saying
""Lord forgive me but I need this, I've been really static""
And he grabbed the hundred off the top and started staring at it
Held it up to see if it's real or fake
Then looked around to make sure nobody was looking, and then he took it, damn
Off to the streets with the Lord, off to go find him a whore
A hundred bucks in the dash and now he riding the course
He see some bitch on the corner, he told her hop in the car
And then she opened the door
""Come on bitch, yo hurry the fuck up, I ain't tryna get caught up""
Then continued driving and stuff, looking for a spot in the cut
""How much for head?""
(A 100)
""Now how much for sex?""
(A 100)
""Damn, a 100?""
(Come on, that's not a lot)
""Fuck""
(Why you playing?)
""Nah, I'm just saying, that's a lot bitch, like gotta calm down, damn""
Now she making eye contact, she got on eye contacts
She see that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that
She's thinking ""I want that"", he pulls his dick out his pants
""Ooh God is good""
Transaction complete, and she went back to the streets
Back to the cash at the leash, she back to get back on her knees
And she don't like how this shit make her feel
But you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills
For real, she wanna retire soon, she swear to God (*smack*)
She looked up and seen the hand of God, oh my God...
Forgot she had a pimp
That nigga been looking for her ass for days
Took every single dollar and left her eye black and gray
He be on the corner jamming, getting drunk that-a-way
7-Eleven gambling, throwing all his cash away, yup
Some say that money rule the world, I know you heard that shit
Money the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit
Yeah, that pimp just lost that hundred dollars in that dice game
He said ""I should've just bet that shit on tonight's game, whatever nigga, nice game""
The homie who won it walked off with the hundred
Then opened up his wallet, stuck it inside and then put it in his pocket
Started stomping and running
Feeling so good, started hopping and jumping, money flopping and rumbling
His eyes is as big as his smile, no stopping him from the prow
He's jogging, skipping around, 'til his wallet fell on the ground
A hundred sticking halfway out, in the back of a halfway house
For like three weeks so don't even ask me how, check it
A homeless man walks by, sees a wallet, opens his eyes
And then grabs it, opens to check what's inside and to his surprise
It's money, a couple dollars, a hundred bill with some writing
A number written in red, if he had a phone he would call
But he doesn't, so he says ""Fuck it, it's mine
And I'm really hungry and thirsty, I want some beer, a beef jerky
Maybe some ten percent juice, hm
And if the store's open, I need some cigarettes too"", true
He walked into the same store on the block
Just so happen to be the same exact store that got robbed
What a coincidence, that shit is just as weird as I thought
The clerk rang him out and said, ""That'll be 18.25""
And then he held that hundred out with the red number written on top
Then everything stopped
[Voicemail]
Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace

[Brief Message]

Picture me putting my city all over the map
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah)
They wasn't believers, I had to get even at math
(What, what, what, what)
Be coming, I'm pulling and jumping all over your grass
(Yeah, yeah, whoa, whoa, uh)
So tell all my bitches I got a new girl
Tell the police that I'm robbing the bank and I want all of my 50's in cash
Bitch, I'm tired of living, check to check
I need twenty models and some extra sex
Smiling in my grave, bitch I'm fresh to death
I've been drinking Wu-Tang with Inspectah Deck getting drunk (Skrt)
Yeah, I got some shit that I gotta just get off my chest
(Whoa, uh, uh, uh, yeah, damn)
I can admit I got lots on my list and you next (uh, uh)
Take it how you want it, I ain't famous like I want it
But I think I might just skrrt off, blow the speakers and turn up
Pop a bottle of Smirnoff, go to church with my shirt off
Tell the Lord that I'm here now, I've been waiting for so long
I've been patient for so long, breaking rules like there's no laws
And I did it for a long time
If you don't like me, take a ticket, there's a long line
Nice to meet me, hoe, I think the pleasure's all mine
Shit, they've been clocking me so long, I think they lost time

Ooh you lost your mind, nigga
Fuck you mean? Whoo! Hol' on
Goddamn it, nigga
Fuck you mean? Whoo!
And I don't trust a mothafucking soul
What the fuck you mean? Whoo!
Hol' up, whoa whoa whoa whoa
What the fuck you mean? Whoo! (Hol up now)
Look

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
Don't know what you thinkin', compare me to niggas is nothing
(Uh, uh, uh, what, what)
Adrenaline pumping and blood'll be leaking and running
(Word, word, yeah, yeah, uh)
Shit, I do what I do, I don't care if you like it or love it
(Nah, nah, uh, uh, Joyner)
Tell all of my bitches I got a new girl, wait
And tell the police that I'm robbing the bank and I want all my money in 100s
Bitch, I'm tired of living on the edge
I wanna sell drugs but they gon' call the feds
I just bought a brick and that shit cost an arm and leg
My momma told me, ""Take it back and get a job instead""
(Where's your common sense, nigga?)
Me and the devil got too much in common, I swear
(Damn, uh, uh, damn, uh)
Born in the ghetto, I never had nothing to fear (nah, nah)
Take it how you want it, I ain't famous like I want it
So, I might just throw a hissy fit
Call up Cassie, ask her if she broke up with Diddy yet
I said shawty, if she's talking I ain't hitting it
Cause she gon' call her friends up and brag about the shit we did
Whoa, I ain't into pillow talking, go chop off your lips
If I ain't in your top ten, go dive off a bridge
My block boys got Glock fours that'll knock off your lid
I doubt you gon' pop off, so hop off my dick
Whoo!
[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Nigga, fuck you mean? Whoo!
Goddamn it, I said fuck you mean?!
Listen, I don't trust a muthafucking soul
Nigga, no, nigga, fuck you mean?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
What the fuck you mean?!

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
You thought I was finished, you thought it was over?
You thought I retired, you thought I went fishing with Kobe?
Nigga, I'm still as the illest, considered as one of the coldest
Still-a pull apart in a rapper head like Moses, mm-hm
I'm throwback like I'm Motorola
But hoe, I'm cooler than a cup of yogurt
Black flag, Crip boy, truck soldier
I'm cool with drug lords and Ayatollah's
Rap god, cyclops and ogre
Bitch I'm King Kong, ain't nobody told ya?
Fuck you think bro still smoking?
Aww fuck it, I'm Bobby Brown, 'bout to go get loaded
Retarded Paul McCartney, bitch I'm rich
I'm Muhammad Ali, I talk shit
I'm James Brown, bout to tear down this bitch
I'm Michael Jackson, bitch I'm bad as bad gon' get (oww!)
Fuck you mean?

Yo, this is the third time this week
That you failed to pick up your son, and I'm just so confused
Like I find it funny that you stay in the studio laying something down
Slanging mixtapes but you have yet to bring home diapers
And lay your kid down and go to sleep
On Snapchat talking 'bout, ""Where's the plug?""
Like I’m sure he’s at National Grid tryna cut my lights back on
Like ""a dollar and a dream"" ass career
And you can't even come home and give us a dollar for some fucking milk

This the type of shit that make you pull up outside
Like bitch, why you bending my line?
I ain't tryna fuck your nigga, he ain't even my type
Told my brother that I love him then I put the phone down
Gotta be rollin' with the burners that be in the ghost now
Talking about making money and I'm spending your money
But spending hella money is the only way you're going now
Yo these private conversations got me thinking out loud
Used to queue up out front, I come through the back now
Dear mama, all I wanted was to make you proud
That's why I never fucked a broke nigga on the rebound
All my daughters know is hustlin' shows
Kill off a pussy in a eight-inch boat
Maura, I can fly in the sky, my yodes
Chop coming, don't wanna look like you
Fuck with me nigga, I've been putting London on the map
Ain't it funny I'm the first female ting mad?

I got, I got, I got, I got anger, hate and jealousy inside my DNA
I got envy and bad energy inside my DNA
I got snakes and satan entities inside my DNA
I got demons, pain and enemies inside my DNA
I got passion, guts and action tucked inside my DNA
I got pints of Michael Jackson's blood inside my DNA
I got Captain Crunch and Magic Dust inside my DNA
I don't do massive drugs, don't gas me up
Look, I got, I got, I got, I got
Murder all on my conscience
I might take me a hostage
I fell asleep in Worcester, I just woke up in Compton
Shout out to LA, where your songs play niggas gon' put on my shit
Half of you niggas fake, heart full of clay
What's your last name? Thompson?
Even if you join a gang, that don't really change up the fact you the softest
Don't let the colors get to your head
Who the fuck you think you are, Rodman?
Who the fuck you think you are, Ron O'Neal?
I'mma murder everything, I don't chill
If you lucky, then I might let you eat the scraps off whatever's left I'll kill
Nigga, pull it and *bap bap*
Blow your brains all on your crop top
Sick of niggas thinking they hot shots
Full of jokes, niggas get knock knocked
This is the chop shop
I know where they cooking the Crock-Pot
Semi-auto making them Hopscotch
All my life I've been cock blocked
I'm tired of being stuck in a blood clot
Talking that blah blah
I'm runnin', jumpin', duckin' them cops
Hop in the puddle while you jumping on FOX trucks
You can run all you want, we just gon' see how far you can get
If fans want me do features with their favorite rappers that'd be the best
Look, all them niggas know exactly who I am, but they don't give me no respect
'Cause the problem is they don't fuck with me, everybody see me as a threat
Yeah yeah, I know this sounds like some fresh air
If you don't hear me right use your left ear
I want to say that I'm the next up
I want it last year, they said next year
I want it this year, they say not yet
But I'ma take it from whoever got next
Twin deuce-deuces, I'm Clyde Drexler
What is competition, who gon' die next?
Get dissected in the lab with pliers, pencils, and a razor with my initials
Get stabbed by the guy who sent you
I'ma sign, send you the pollution, environmental
I'm a giant pistol, you're a kung fu guy
It's simple, you gon' lead by my example
I'm a flying missile that connected and fried your mental
DNA on the side your temple, nigga

[Verse 2]
Someone call 911, niggas gon' die when I'm finished
I'll probably get locked up for life, what the fuck you thinkin'?
My whole life I been too fuckin' patient
Give me respect before I fuckin' take it
I know you see me don't duck your faces
You see me mentioned on publications
Then you get sour and suck your face in
Pay for my dick since you love to taste it
Better swallow the shit, don't you fuckin' waste it
I'ma flood the nation, this is suffocation, this is deprivation
This is Satan's kitchen, that's your destination
I got heaven waitin' angels flyin', prayin'
Jesus entertainin', Marvin Gaye singin'
Martin Luther dreamin', Pac and Biggie schemin'
Bob Marley smokin', Paul McCartney floatin'
Prodigy  mobbin', Pun say I’m joking
JFK riddin' 'round locked and loaded nigga
Shout out to Joe Budden
These niggas really don't know nothin'
I swear they gang full of ho muffins
I should just roll up and (blaow) *gunshot*
No one seen, nobody know nothin'
This shit is so touchin'
Shout out to Kevin Durant
This that underdog court that they throw us in
I blow your shoulders in
This that crack, this that shit that them hoes got they nose up in
Cinematic, movie shit I usually watch a little static
I crack you till you're leaking and begin to panic
A DNA ya bleeding and get liver damaged and get jimmy jammers
And I never had too many manners
And you know my momma always told me I was heavy handed
Fuck it though 'cause I was fully loaded
Now the semi jammin', I'm already blammin'
Got the hammer and the minivan
And I'm a busy man but I got liquor
And she bad and boujee
All of ya'll snitches is Ratatouille
Can't beat me up so they gotta shoot me
They don't like me now they gotta sue me
Killin' y'all softly, I got the Fuji
Don't touch me, all of y'all got the cooties
That's your bitch who sent me all the nudies
Get my dick sucked playin' Call of Duty
Nigga fuckin' shoot me
Nigga damn it they ought to know
Em shoulda' signed me a while ago
Cole shoulda' signed me a while ago
Dre shoulda' gave me a beat or two
Diddy shoulda' had me writin' for him in the crib for a week or two
I don't smoke weed but I needed to
This is a meter room
You gon' need a bag and a feeding tube
I'm mad and I mean it too
It won't be the last I'll see you soon
Kiss my ass and I mean it too
A lotta drama
Bitch I'm Freddy Krueger mixed with Jeffrey Dahmer
I know you're probably mad 'cause you look very sour
I'd probably be in hell if I was any hotter
I'd probably be Usher if I ain't wear a condom
I've never been a fan of Gucci, Fendi, Prada
But my auntie got it and she never leave the crib without it
Some people say I'm crazy, that's the the thing about it
Whatchu think about it? Think about it, nigga

Cause lately conversations with you kinda crucial
Ever since I got laid off, you don't treat me like you used to, no
(You know how much I love you) But now my backs to the wall
Kinda hard to believe when you make it seem like you not havin' a ball
You make it harder for me when you wanna leave but I miss havin' your all
You ain't talkin' to me and it's been a week and I ain't happy at all
Listen, it's been way too long and you been actin' funny

[Intro]
Look

[Verse 1]
I got some bones to pick
You ain't heard no one as cold as this (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Give me the stick, let me hold this shit
You make a move, I'ma blow this bitch
You 'bout to get what you supposed to get, uh
I don't know this trick
Why she keep blowin' my phone and shit? (Ayy)
Will someone please tell me whose ho this is? (Ayy, ayy)
Nigga, you know who the coldest is? (Coldest is?)
Who's cold as this?
My Lambo got too many options, I don't even know what mode this in (Ayy)
Nigga, you know who flow this is? (Flow this is?)
I just stole this shit
Niggas act like I ain't supposed to be rich
Like I ain't grow up where the roaches live
Likе I ain't come up, like—
How do you spell ""Crazy""? G-E-N-I-U-S
How do you spеll ""Pay me""? I-R-S
What you know about mental health when you live in hell and you out of meds?
What the fuck is a meltdown when my meltdown's on a private  jet?
Woah, labels ain't wanna sign the check (Joyner)
Then I got on my Ye shit, turned every no to a solid yes
I don't care about who's poppin' now, let the whole world know I am next
I ain't quittin' 'til I touch the sky or a nigga livin' on the ISS (Brrt, brrt)
See Joyner Lucas LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like[Chorus]
Hold up, Ye's not crazy (Ye's not crazy)
Even if they try to cancel me, that ain't gon' phase me (Ain't gon' phase me)
Yeah, I sin, God forgave me (God forgave me)
How the fuck I'm gon' change the world if they gon' change me? (They gon' change me?)
Ye's not crazy (Ye's not crazy), well, maybe I am (Well, maybe I am)
Never thought I'd be a billionaire, now I'm like, maybe I can (Maybe I can)
Jesus walks, nigga, I ran (Nigga, I ran)
Sorry I pissed you off, I'll do it again

[Verse 2]
Tell me what's greater than God and worse than the Devil? I hate all the mind games
I'm tired of eatin' the scraps they left on the table, I need me an entrée
I wasn't seein' success, so I had to switch and do this shit my way
Shorty ain't pay me no mind 'til I got a bitch, then she wanna rendez
Yeah, running red lights like fuck what the sign say
I just went back to the future to cop me a Urus and stunt on my prom date (Joyners)
I'm havin' dinners with billionaire hitters, they lookin' at me like a small change
Maybe want move to Miami and buy me some kilos and turn into Scarface
Yeah, they try to do me like Marilyn Manson
Back me inside of a corner and turn me to someone who shot up and dances
Someone who won't go to Sway in the Morning and tell him he don't got the answers
Someone afraid of takin' the mic from niggas and takin' my chances
I got a list of you niggas I'm better than
One of the greatest, but niggas don't mention him
Soon as they sleepin', I plot my revenge on 'em
Shell put a dent in 'em, baow (Brrt)
Being famous done fucked up my mental, I made so much money, I lost all my friends and them
Broke up the family, but kept all the realest ones
I'm not as sane as I felt I was

Hold up, Ye's not crazy (Ye's not crazy)
Even if they try to cancel me, that ain't gon' phase me (Ain't gon' phase me)
Yeah, I sin, God forgave me (God forgave me)
How the fuck I'm gon' change the world if they gon' change me? (They gon' change me?)
Ye's not crazy (Ye's not crazy), well, maybe I am (Well, maybe I am)
Never thought I'd be a billionaire, now I'm like, maybe I can (Maybe I can)
Jesus walks, nigga, I ran (Nigga, I ran)
Sorry I pissed you off, I'll do it again

[Part 2]

[Verse 3]
Watch busts, come check my wrist, uh, uh, bitch, I'm lit
Hit just once, that bitch obsessed, uh, uh, bitch, I'm blessed
Too on point, I just don't miss (Skrrt, skrrt), way too fresh
So much drip, I came through wet, major flex
I hope the industry better get used to me
I told them rappers they really just food to me
Kill all these niggas and read 'em a eulogy
Ain't nothin' much you can do to me, uh
I got a check and then bought me some jewelry
They say I changed and I'm not what I used to be
I done got bigger, this shit feel like puberty
I know they better make room for me, mm
And I'm tired of bein' the underdog that come along
And they wanna put a fuckin' muzzle on and shut the bark
And chain me to another fuckin' porch all summer long
Then tell me I should go and run along like nothing's wrong
I watched everybody get awards all summer long
When I was eatin' on the fuckin' floor in the garage
That type of shit'll drive a nigga nuts and up in arms
And now my brain isn't what it was, I'm fuckin' callin' it, ah
[Chorus]
Hold up (Brr, brr), Ye's not crazy (Ye's not crazy)
Even if they try to cancel me, that ain't gon' phase me (Ain't gon' phase me)
Yeah, I sin, God forgave me (God forgave me)

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Guess we gotta try this again

[Verse]
Dear Lord, I know that we been here before (Yeah)
It's been a long time, I hope that You don't slam the door
I tried to walk away, but there's some shit I can't ignore
I could be wrong but seems like You don't even care no more (Facts)
'Cause since our last talk, You ain't playin' fair no more (Uh)
And when I pray, it kinda feel like You ain't there no more
I still don't understand why niggas who deserve to die is livin'
But the ones who ain't deserve it isn't here no more
And, no, I don't want no one else to die
Instead of tradin' souls, I got somethin' else in mind (Yeah)
There's a lot of moments that I wish that I could change
I could fix a lot of pain if You help me out this time (Joyner)
Maybe we can undo all the damage, press rewind
Reset the clock and make it so some niggas never die (Yeah)
And maybe fix all the mistakes of those who still alive and give them all a second try (Damn)
Erase that Will Smith slap and turn him back around
Or wait 'til they get backstage, so they could have it out (Yeah)
Or maybe make it so that Chris chose a different joke (Uh)
A different topic, somethin' Jada won't be mad about (Facts)
Matter of fact, let's talk about the shit I'm sad about
When Pop Smoke accidentally leaked that address out (Pssh)
Lord, You know the streets crazy, how You dropped the ball
When You know niggas keep a target on these rappers now? (Baow, baow, baow)
And give us Kobe Bryant back, we a mess without him (Uh)
Take back the day he ever stepped inside the helicopter
Make him take the car instead and forget the chopper
Maybe take a different route or get a different driver
Can't believe You took his daughter and she left behind him
It's kinda hard to see the positive and that's the problem
I know You don't make mistakes, but I was hopin' You'd erase that bullshit, so his family won't be left without him (Yeah)
And I wish I could fly to Russia on a different mission
And make 'em pay for puttin' Brittney Griner into prison (Word)
Or maybe You could bring her back to February 17th
And You could take the CBD, so she ain't flyin' with it (Yeah)
Or maybe change that nine years and give her nine minutes (Minutes)
Or better yet, change the laws, so they could stop trippin' (Trippin')
I know that's a lot to wish, and it ain't my business
But until You grant my wish, I ain't gon' stop wishin' (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
But Lord, listen, this shit urkin' me (Me)
How You take PNB? That shit absurd to me (Why You do that shit?)
So many questions 'bout that shit and it's disturbin' me (Word)
Like niggas can't eat waffles without security? (Security)
And niggas can't work hard and go buy some jewelry? (Jewelry)
That one hurt to see (Damn)
And by the end of the song, they gon' try to murder me
And if they do, I hope my fans take it personally
I know You hear me talkin', Lord, don't be curvin' me
Won't You take us back to Kylie Jenner's party (Pssh)
Before them, shots hit the floor (Baow, baow)
Before the bullets ricocheted and leave a drippin' mall
We don't know the truth or if we misinformed
But either way, take it back and make Tory hop inside a different car (Word)
Broke my heart when DMX died, that hit the core
Feel like that nigga was an angel in a different form
Might've had a drug problem like he did before
But he was fightin' demons and I know that that's a different war (That's a different war)
Mm, You must got a major ego
I ain't tryna disrespect or tryna play the hero (Nah)
But when You took Takeoff, You took my favorite Migos
Look, I don't know how that make sense 'cause it make zero (None)
And fuck a wrong place, wrong time, that ain't G though
Took that man right in his prime, that's plain evil (Pssh)
When Tommy Lister died, I cried and played CeeLo (Word)
'Cause I can't even watch Friday without sayin', ""Deebo"" (Facts, uh)
You know this shit got me stressed, right? (Yeah)
Starin' at the Bible, tryna figure out who's next like
Why You take the ones who ain't deserve to see what death like? (Huh?)
Meanwhile, 6ix9ine, free, livin' his best life (Huh?)
Go back to the day that he took the stand and confessed, right?
Tape his mouth shut, so he never talk to the feds, like
Make him do his time so his niggas gotta do less, right?
Make him learn from Bobby, so he can know what respect, like (Woah)
Lord, forgive me for my language and these bad words
But that Candace Owens bitch get on my last nerves
How You gon' tell me that what we witnessed on TV wasn't murder when we watched niggas turn his ass into Casper? (Ayy)
George died from asphyxiation and that's a factor
Fentanyl or not, he'd had never died, and his last words were, ""I cannot breathe""
So really she gotta chill, or maybe they should trade places, so she could see how it feel (Burn, for real)
Lil' bitch got me stressed, God (Yeah)
Probably not prepared for what I'm askin' next, God (Uh)
Bring Ye momma back 'cause he a mess, God
And he ain't been the same ever since Donda West died
Yeah, that's the day Kanye West died
First his heart, then his mind, then the rest died
And if your bank account is overkill, your soul could be broken still
Even a rich spirit, money can't buy (Uh)
I pray that Heavens watch me (Ayy)
Rest in peace Biz Markie, you got peace (Peace)
Young Dolph, King Von, Drakeo, top three (Three)
Black Rob, Trouble, Virgil and Shock G (Ayy)
Pat Stay, Kay Slay and Fred the God, geesh
Almost took Lil Tjay, but I'm happy he godly
Lord, You even took Black Panther, that's not G
And when Sidhu Moose Wala got shot that shot me (I'm free)
Beggin' for Your guidance on this ghetto earth
Frustrated, tryna understand how Heaven works (Heaven works)
I'm just hopin' You could pull a couple strings or redo a couple things, so maybe we could get a second turn (Second turn)
You took Juice from us, that forever hurts (Forever hurts)
But puttin' the blame on You, that'll never work (Never work)
I know this ain't Your fault, it's the devil's work (Devil's work)

I'll hold her down, if you don't got me, then I got me (Yeah, I got me)
It's over now, so please don't call me, please don't find me (Please don't find me)
Yeah, yeah, when I move on, you wanna stop me (Wanna stop me)
On everything, girl, I'm a king, I think I'm Rodney (I think I'm Rodney)
Ain't no fake love, only got real niggas around me (Real niggas around me)
And all you care about is drinkin', gettin' sloppy, you don't give a fuck about me

[Chorus: King OSF & Joyner Lucas]
She got a nice face, she got a nice body (She got a nice body, woo)
I still can't love her, I still can't trust her, baby, I'm sorry (Girl, I'm sorry, buck, buck)
When I'm off that Henny, I see double, feel like a zombie (Feel like a zombie, buck, buck)
But we still don't ever slip, no movin' sloppy (No movin' sloppy)
She wanna study all the tats all on my body (On my body)
Somebody told her that my middle name Muhammad (Buck, buck)
She thinkin' I'ma fake a love, say I ain't 'bout it (Buck, buck)
I told her, ""Baby, watch your mouth, you better stop it"" (You better stop, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
All my life been sucker-free (Sucker-free)
That's absurd
None of these hoes are cuffin' me (Cuffin' me, ayy)
That's my word
And I heard money don't come from trees (Hey)
But you can't hustle me
Yeah, your ass look good in them jeans
That don't mean too much to me (Buck, buck, buck)
I need a lil' somethin' with a vibe (Vibe)
Lil' somethin' with drive
I know you wan' fuck all day
Might try and make love to your mind
I been tryin' get my mind right, ooh
These hoes ain't my type, ooh
She want that limelight, ooh
She'll do anything for a Klondike, ooh (Buck, buck)
What you gon' do for the pension? (Skrrt, skrrt)
Way too tempted
Tryin' get rich, get mentioned
She'll do anything for attention
She'll do anything for her interest
How did you get so senseless?
How did you get so foolish?
How did you get so clueless?

But nah, I still ain't hers
And she just callin' you ""daddy""
Ain't know what your real name was (Real name was)
Friends I feel changed up
And shit I still think of
Love got me mentally scarred
Still tryna heal things up (Heal things up)
We all started from the bottom, tryna build things up
But it's some dudes who love to hate and that's some real strange love
I know some real gangstas (Real gangstas)
Niggas who still slang drugs (Still slang drugs)
They got pills, can't bluff (Pills, can't bluff)
But they ain't got no love (Got no love)
And they ain't got no trust
'Cause those'll be your downfall (Downfall)
Bro says, ""Shawty bad, why you ain't keep her 'round, dawg?"" (Keep her 'round, dawg)

She don't know the half, half, I'm a savage (Yeah, yeah)
I just put the cash bag on a mattress (Yeah)
I don't need it that bad, you can't have it (Have)
Tens, twenties, fifties, hunnids, run it, oh God

Boston bitch, she bougie (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, you goofy
Told niggas, ""You don't like me? Shoot me""
And if you don't wanna fight me, sue me
Guaranteed niggas won't like the new me
This feel like a Spike Lee movie

[Verse]
Room full of hoes and I might get choosy
Please excuse me
All of my moves are carefully planned
Don't play with me, I'm a family man
I put your bitch on my family plan
My mansion lookin' like Fantasy Land
I bought a beach with some Canada sand
All of my moves are carefully planned
I'm two steps ahead like Nigerian scams (Word)
Now hand mе the Benz
You in the crib and I'm hеre with the fans
My bitch got titties like Pamela And'
And she wanna fuck in a janitor's van
I'm 'bout to turn to a psycho
You 'bout to see my true colors like Michael
I'm 'bout to pick niggas up with a rifle
I never lit niggas up but I might though
I'm a cool nigga but I can get spiteful
I'm 'bouta fuck this shit up like a typo
You do not know me, no, we ain't related
And we ain't got mutual friends that I might know
I don't wanna be acquainted regardless
Every bitch I ever been with told me I'm heartless
I don’t trust a single motherfucker, I'm cautious
I can never win, they want me up in a coffin
Way before I started winnin', had a couple of losses
Had to make a livin' out my mother's apartment
Wasn't too much opportunity to come up in Boston
I was fucking exhausted, I was done with the talkin'
I was workin' odd jobs, had me stuck in the office
On God, I was outside runnin' and walkin' nonstop
On a dark block, duckin' and dodgin' all cops
'Til they all stop, buckin' and sparkin' all Glocks
'Til my heart stops workin' at ten breaths
I benchpress any fuck nigga relentless
I been dead, I ain't put you niggas to bed yet
The bed wet, this a wet dream of wet sex wit' rednecks
Why am I not allowed to feel, to feel free?
I learned from God, whatever will, just will be
I bet you prolly wanna kill, to kill me
The cops who killed Breonna Taylor still free
And George Floyd'd prolly kill to still breathe
How many black lives did they kill to kill me?
I protest but we still feel no real peace
I hear no relief, I still don't feel free
And man I hate fucked up rules
Got a fucked up head with some fucked up screws
Bitch, please don't put me in a fucked up mood
Got twin nines, and we play duck, duck, goose
Better jump up, move 'fore I bum-rush
Niggas get lumped up too, I'm in a fucked up mood
I don't even trust me, why the fuck trust you?
Three deep in your crib like a drug bust, one plus two, nigga
I'm with the fam
Bitch, you a pig, I don't fuck with no ham
All y'all been sleepin', I'm tuckin' you in
I built a label then upped the advance
Please don't compare me to none of these scrams
I'm buildin' my brand, you stuck in the ground
I took advantage and stuck to the plan (Joyner)

In sweet dreams, I kid myself
Have your love for good
I really had hoped you'd stay
But like the river, you just come and go
And these things, they comfort me
When my mind's on you
And I feel you comfort me
But like the river, it just comes and goes
[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
I used to think that you was Superman when I was younger (Yeah)
Findin' comfort in your voice when I was down and under
Put you on a pedestal and now I kinda wonder if that made sense
‘Cause I'm convinced you showed a lot of colors (Yeah)
All them nights I was alone, I hid inside thе covers
Used to argue with my moms whеnever I was stubborn (Facts)
I never warmed up to the idea of a step-dad because he wasn't you
And you and him ain't even like each other (Word)
Used to bring me ‘round your girlfriends as I recall
I thought one or two was cool, but I ain't like ‘em all
‘Cause all you ever did was argue ‘bout who's right or wrong
And you ain't have no job, so you would sit at home and light a bong (Yeah)
Used to crave for your attention, but I never got it
And everything you said we'd do is just another promise
You had dreams of bein' famous and I never doubted
But I started rhymin' to impress you, if we bein' honest (Facts)
But we can have some bondin' time and maybe pow-wow
A father/son relationship that we can smile ‘bout
At time's you got abusive and I had to bow down
Or keep on makin' music to try and compete with Bow Wow
Your father died when you was young, I think that made a scar
I started thinkin' maybe that's why you the way you are (Nah)
End of the day, no excuse for how you played your part
Told myself when I became a father, I'ma raise the bar (Word)
We had a lot of fallin' outs and didn't talk for years
And all them birthdays and holidays got awfully weird
You threw me in a foster home and I was brought to tears
Livin' with some strangers, feelin' anxious, I was lost and scared (Yeah)

And now I'm starin' at the river tryna get across
And all I see is apparitions of what never was
And everything I used to wish for is dead and lost
And if I never see your ass again, I'll be better off
I'll be better off (Yeah)

[Chorus: Elijah James & Joyner Lucas]
You are so negative (Uh)
And you say you know
But you know a goddamn thing
Like the river, you just run and go
You say you could do good
And better you know
But you tried no goddamn thing
Like the river, I'ma run from you

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
I told myself I wouldn't write a song, but fuck it, I did
Oftentimes, I sit and wonder if it's somethin' I did
Or maybe I was immature, but is it somethin' I said?
I can't help but feel the feelin' that there's somethin' I missed
I told you somethin' happened to me and you ain't protect me (Yeah)
You tried to say you ain't believe me as you disrespect me (Facts)
And plus, you never had my back, in fact, you may resent me in a way
‘Cause everythin' I say, you try to use against me (Word)
And I never knew your other kids, but I knew of ‘em (True)
I'm not really sure if I like ‘em, but I do love ‘em (Do)
Shit, I don't even think you knew but just a few of ‘em
‘Cause all your baby mothers stayed away to keep you from ‘em (Word)
You probably out fillin' they heads with shit that's not the truth
You probably told ‘em that I switched up when I got some loot (Uh)
You probably told ‘em that I'm greedy and I'm not so cool
That I worship the devil and I sold my soul to cop a pool (Yeah)
I worked my ass off to get rich, let's not confuse
I sacrificed my whole twenties just so I can move (True)
While everybody else was chillin', hangin' out with crews
I was writin' a plan to finally win while tryin' not to lose (True)
I still remember signin' my deal and you got hella funny
And at that time, you probably figured I had hella money (Yeah)
But I only got a small advance, so I ain't even get a chance to hold you down
‘Cause then you started gettin' jealous of me
But I'm worth a couple million now, I turned out fine (Yeah)
I copped my moms a big crib and went and got mine
An indoor pool with a house made and I'm not lyin' (Nope)
A happy son who loves his dad, it's about time (Yeah)
[Refrain: Joyner Lucas]
But I'm still starin' at the river tryna get across
And all I see is apparitions of what never was
And everything I used to wish for is dead and lost
And if I never see your ass again, then I'll be better off
Nigga I'll be better off

I wanna expand my brain, but I'm trapped in prison
Got me shackled up in chains for the maximum sentence
I'm tryna get out my ways to bring me back to census
And maybe teach myself some game and turn my rags to riches, mmm
Ain't no excuses we all start at the bottom
Gotta learn to speak yo' truth and that's just part of the process
Shit, if I ain't the solution, guess I'm part of the problem
You pullin' flowers out the roots when I just wanted to blossom
And I'm exhausted, but I tried my best
We needed change 'cause we tired of stress, tryna flex
Bought you a chain, but couldn't buy respect, I'm not impressed
We can't evolve unless we follow steps, it's not a test
I'm tired of frontin' like we not oppressed
And I thought if I was rich, then all my problems'd be through
'Til I made a few million and now I got more problems than you
I know it feels good to win, but it hurts a lot when you lose
Don't ever say what you gon' do unless you followin' through

[Chorus]
I'm talking execution (Execution), uh
And I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm learnin' as I'm growin'
That's the evolution (The evolution)
Hope I don't finish last, I'm still healin' from my past
I need some retribution (Retribution)
Did a lot of gettin' even, but I'm sick and tired of beefin'
What's the resolution? (Resolution)
I'm talkin' evolution (Evolution)

I gotta be honest, I never thought that I would pop this quickly
Feels good to look at my phone and see Rihanna hit me
Nah, it ain't on no shit like that, shorty a goddess to me
Just one of my friends that I can vent to when my conscious get me
Look, I ain't into what niggas is doin', I'm on some other shit
I never been the type to turn up and be on that clubbin' shit
I'm lookin' at niggas like, ""Bruh, you grown, how you still love this shit?""
I'd rather be home and watch some movies with my son and shit
'Cause I ain't tryna impress nobody, that shit get old quick
Like starin' at an old flick
Trynna travel back in '06
Maybe hope for what I won't get
All that temporary happiness only last until you grow sick
And them lights start to go dim
And the walls start to close in
And the times starts to pass you by
Don't act surprised
Better be careful what you ask from God
I had some jobs, shit, I quit and took control, my nigga
Got tired of buildin' companies up that I ain't own, my nigga
It's time to grow my nigga

I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm learnin' as I'm growin'

We can manifest it (Word) you'd rathеr hit the Louis store
Wastin' all your blessings, care about the ones who doubt you
Just to impress some hoes who never gave a fuck about you

Never believed in family, that word is really a cover
Just a title that have the advantage to keep you under (Oh, yeah)

So watch it, you show your colors
We livin' in a world where prison walls is depravation (Yeah)
Livin' in a world where snitchin' calls for celebration (Yeah)
Livin' in a world where niggas crawl and segregation

Protest until we flatline, paralyzed (Uh)

If it ain't black owned, I'm prolly gon' use it to chop crack on
Hard white for all them hard nights I had my back on
Roach-infested carpet, tip-toe in my mother's room
See a dresser and felt no pressure when takin' a twenty off it
Compton like a closed coffin, we walkin' to school coughin'
Often high off the gun smoke, Boston had at the front door
Cookin' class, I'm JAY, Hov', rock it up on they stove
Me and my teacher goin' back and forth like Noname and J. Cole
You said I would never be what? I wouldn't amount to what?
Now you in this Trader Joe's, same lines, sayin', “Wassup?” (Oh)
Talkin' ‘bout like how you like my songs, not knowin' it was me
Security had me in a headlock and I told you I couldn't breathe
Now it's Black Lives Matter and white letters on your shirt
Now how many black lives did you help, or did you hurt?
Did you handicap, block, push to excel or did you hinder?
Since hindsight's 20/20, I guess you don't remember
Now you with your mixed child, havin' all these mixed feelings
But do your black husband know you tried to burn down our village?
But never mind, from the line, that's for y'all to figure out
Just know that boy who wasn't shit bailed all his niggas out
And it's my black queen, I kiss her on her black lips
And she rock Off-White ‘cause she support black shit

Who sent you here?
Why you keep fronting like your friends are here?
Acting like you ‘bout to be next this year
I mean the food gone, ain't nothing left to share
We done ate that shit
Funny how they told me to stack this year
Now a nigga get colder than central air
And your momma shoulda aborted you and left you there
Damn, I need a massage
Where the gay bitches when I need a ménage?
She said she got a porn tape that I needed to watch
And I remember days where I couldn’t even get by
Uh, I couldn’t even get mine
Couldn’t pull a fine chick to save my life
And ain’t nobody want to go with me to the prom
And now I got so many hoes I can’t even decide
Real shit, believe it or not
The light skins love me like I’m Chico DeBarge
And I ain’t give a fuck if you’re sleeping or not
Time to wake niggas up, whoo!
Fuck you talking ‘bout?
I be fronting to these hoes like I’m rich
And they don’t know I got a room at my momma’s house
You know it's always something 'bout the impressive ones
Working all week for my check to come
And I ain’t make shit after taxes though
But it feel good not to stress so much
Know it’s something coming in for now
And I can get my son a Nintendo now
Couple shirts and a damn Netflix account
That’s it? (Goddamn) yep, but that’s okay

So when you see Diddy, tell him I got words
My shrink keep telling me to calm my nerves
But it’s been a long time since I got heard
And don’t nobody give a fuck when you starving though
They don’t answer me when I’m hollering though
Try to cancel me like ""The Cosby Show""
Until I put them hands on them like Rousey though
I got a hundred fans waiting in the lobby line
Taking shots like it’s party time
Hands up, ain’t nobody got to die
I just got four rings like the Audi sign
I just bought cocaine for a nigga to flip
Real shit, the bigger the brick
Now these hoes looking at the flick of the wrist
And I can take your girl out to chicken and shrimp
She said my head so big I could live in a blimp
Word? Heh, well listen to this
I remember watching ""MTV Cribs""
Thinking how the fuck all these wack niggas get rich
While I’m eating TV dinners
You know, the ones with the meat in them?
Pause, I kinda wonder what they see in them
Got laid off from a job, it was seasonal, geez

I ain’t got much but I feel loved
Just be real love, just be real love, just be (yeah yeah yeah)

Said I’m feeling way, way up

[Verse 3]
Hold up, pause
We was trying to eat till they told us ""Nah""
I wonder how much a pair of Pradas cost
With the ice cream, bottles and the Häagen-Dazs
Somebody getting robbed while this song is on
We just want cheese and the parmesan
I got a bitch at Mickey-D’s, she be working at night
And she gon’ let me hit it with pajamas on
Yo why these niggas think I’m playing with them? Let the paper hit them
You be copying, that's plagiarism
I be laying, sitting, standing on a fucking hater, kick him in the face
Them niggas got me twisted, I ain’t saving bitches, I got Sega Genesis
And I can play and finish if you want to pay attention
I’m hoping you wait a second, I’m broke and I pay the rent
I don’t know how I freakin' do it, I guess I don’t really believe in losin'
I’ve been a winner since I was a little nigga, nigga!
Hold up, stop
We was trying to win 'til they told us ""Stop""
The cops ran in trying to hold up spots
‘Cause we were moving more O’s than a donut shop, whoo!
I’m pissed for now
I thought I had dreams I could live for now
They told me there was niggas doing worse than me
Motherfucker this as good as it’s gonna get for now, ‘cause
[Chorus]
I ain’t got much but I feel loved
Just be real love, just be real love, just be
I ain’t got much but I feel loved
Just be real love, just be real love, just be (yeah yeah yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
And I’m feeling way, way up
And I’m looking way, way up
And my bitches way, way up
They miss that yeah, yeah, yeah

3095188,Joyner Lucas,Lullaby,"26 ContributorsLullaby Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wonder if you often think about what you became
Or do you ever wonder if you ever truly changed?
Cause honestly I'm lost and I don't know who to blame
I need some help cause I don't know what else to soothe the pain
I watch you raised me as a baby so over protective
Smiling at me, blowing kisses while you hold me restless
When you told me that you loved me I can tell you meant it
And it never took for you to try to ever show your efforts
But we was connected through the heavens though, I felt your soul
And that alone is just a feeling some will never know
I bumped my head and you consoled me as you held me close
And I wonder where went wrong but I guess I'll never know
Cause ever since I grown I felt like you been kind of giving up
And it seems like everything I do is just not good enough
Shit, we don't have the type of bond we used to have before
And I ain't mad at all, I just wonder if you recall the day that I was born
When you used to sing to me like

[Chorus]

I wonder if you often think about what you became
And do you ever wonder if you ever truly changed?
Cause honestly I'm lost and I don't know who to blame
Nigga I need some help cause I don't know what else to soothe the pain
My father died when I was five and I ain't cry at all
I never knew him he just disappeared and I'm not sure if he knew I would grow up to be ruthless, I don't hide my flaws
A young woman with a body and a mind like yours cause we a lot alike
I mean that's prolly' why I felt connected
And when we met I was so innocent but slowly tempted
When you told me that you loved me boy I know you meant it
You sucked the soul out of my body with your own intentions
Now I'm stuck inside a life of prostitution, no discretion
And all you do is beat my ass and leave me slowly breathless
But we don't have the type of bond we used to have before
And I ain't mad at all, I just wonder if you recall when I laid in your arms
And you used to sing to me like

I wonder if you often think about what I became
And do you ever wonder if I ever truly changed?
Cause honestly I'm lost and I don't know who to blame
Listen, I need some help cause I don't know what else to soothe the pain
I used to watch movies about you a whole lot before
I read about you back in school when I was kind of bored
Now I'm ashamed and embarrassed I truly got involved
Cause you gave me a feeling some shit that I never felt before
And I ain't trying to make excuses but inside I'm torn
And you was there for me at times I couldn't find the Lord
And all I had to do was inject you and lock the doors
So I can feel some type of peace while I dream and go watch the stars
And that alone is just a feeling some will never know
But now I'm rotten, it's not the same as I felt before
We don't have the type of bond we used to have before
But I ain't mad at all, I just wonder if you recall sticking you in my arms
When you used to sing to me like

Shit, I close my eyes sometimes and I just think, like...
Like, did you really do this shit, my nigga? Like...
Is this shit even real, cuz?
Ha, this shit crazy (Buck, buck, buck, buck)
I go to sleep and I try to wake up with a clear conscience and shit, you feel me? Like...
I done been through the mud, nigga
Sacrificed a lot to get to the endzone, my nigga
Just tryna give our kids a better life than we had, my nigga (Buck, buck, buck, buck)
I always wanted to change the cycle and
Create a new generation and pass down everything I worked for, my nigga
I'm just, I'm just thinkin' out loud
Look (Yеah)

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
I wonder where lifе would probably take me, yeah
Won't break me, yeah
I show some love to niggas who hate me, yeah (Yeah)
That's crazy, yeah
I kept my cool without no AC, yeah (Word)
Got somethin' to prove, I jumped in the pool and now I'm wavy, yeah (Splash)
And lately, I've been tryna hold my blessings
You talk to God, but you don't know the message
Those are lessons (Yeah)
Walkin' in circles without no direction
No exceptions (Woah)
Don't give advice if you don't know the pressure
Close your lips 'cause half of you more full of shit than colon cleansers (Woo!)
I was born in inside a manger (Word)
And no one ever did me favors, now I'm highly-favored (Yeah)
I finally made it out the hood, now I ain't got no neighbors (Nope)
So before you talk to me, you gotta sign a waiver (Woo)
Post-traumatic stress disorder keep my conscience racin'
Deep inside my thoughts
Wonder how much I can grow if I just even out my flaws (Yeah)
How I teach myself I'm still a winner even when I lost?
And if I lose, I know I'll still be on even when I'm off
I took my chances and I'm eatin' now
I'm finally learnin' all the shit I used to read about
Now I could live all of the shit I used to dream about
'Cause niggas tried to leave me out
But I learned to get revenge through my success and so we even now (Buck, buck)
I stare at my reflection 'cause I like what I see (I like what I see)
All them years at CVS workin' them nights on my feet (Nights on my feet)
Ain't a nigga where I'm from'll reach the heights that I'll reach (Word)
I'll risk it all to give this life to my seed (Buck)

I'm hopin' I don't look down
Ayy, long enough to see me drown
And if I ever come down
I'll be fallin' on the solid ground
Fallin' on the solid ground
Ayy, long enough to see me drown
And if I ever come down
I'll be fallin' on the solid ground

[Verse]
Today, I had a conversation with one of my bros
My homie, he's been close to me since we were six years old
He calls my mama, ""Mom,"" he seen all of my highs and lows
From school fights to sharin' clothes
From B-ball to fuckin' hoes
He sat me down and let me know some things he never told me
Things he never got a chancе to say or even show me
Hе said, ""I know that I don't tell you often, maybe not even at all
But I'm so proud of you and your success, broski
And I admire how you chase your dreams, that shit's courageous
Thank you for never switchin' up when you got rich and famous
Thank you for never givin' up on me or havin' lesser love for me
Whenever we lose touch and be on different pages
I hope you know I'm here for you the way you there for me
It's crazy, you done more for me than all my family tree
And when I say I got your back, just know I really squeeze
And make some niggas really bleed, that's really what I really mean
I'm proud of how much you matured and grew, but you still you
The world knows you for your talent, but I know the real you
And all your trauma's behind closed doors, you'll never heal through
And all the pain, you act like you don't feel, but you still do
I love the fact you keep your shit together, mentally
You work hard for your respect, don't need no empathy
When people look you over and shut you out intentionally
You always said, 'If they don't fuck with you, they will eventually'
But remember when I went through prison?
When I did a bid and you the only one that came to visit?
Put money on my books and sent me pictures of some bitches?
They don't make 'em like you no more, my nigga, you just different
And bro, you ain't have to pay my niece's tuition
Or set me up with that new job and try to teach me the business
Always quick to hold me down before you speak your opinion
What goes around, comes around and that's the reason you winnin'
But listen, I was thinkin', maybe
Since you my broski and I been there since we was babies
You can hit the bank and break me off with somethin' wavy?
Maybe just a couple hundred-thousand? Nothin' crazy
'Cause I been hurtin' lately and I deserve it, maybe
And if you can't do it, that's cool, it ain't like I'll be angry
You still my broski and I love you, but that's kind of shady
'Cause I been goin' through some shit, it ain't like I'm just lazy
So maybe you should pay me
I quit my job 'cause I don't wanna work for no other niggas
What maybe works for some, don't work for some other niggas
Yeah, they pay good, but you know I'm a stubborn nigga
Plus, I know you got my back, right?
If not, then fuck it, I ain't askin' again
Just don't forget who walked with you when your back to the wind
And don't forget who's ideas that got you rappin' again
When you lost your passion and got lazy, and was slackin' and shit
And please don't treat me like them niggas that be askin' for shit
'Cause I never asked you for a damn thing
I'd rather pull a hamstring and then run across some fan blades while jumpin' out a airplane
While sittin' in the damn rain, while beggin' for some spare change
I'm sorry that we all can't be talented and rich like you
The little people still struggle, we ain't lit like you
And if we bein' honest, it don't really seem like you want me to chase my dreams so I can get like you
And lately, you been on some sucker shit, that's what I see, broski
I hope you know that hater shit is a disease, broski
'Cause last time I checked, we was a fuckin' team
And just because you got paper, don't mean that you better than me, broski
I know everything about you
I know every single secret
I know where you rest your head at
I know every bitch you sleep with
I know where you keep your bread at
I pretended I don't see shit
You a greedy motherfucker, you been hopin' I don't be shit
You been gettin' fat while I been starvin'
You been buyin' every car and house while I been in the garbage
I deserve everything you got and more, and that's a bargain
You just wanna shit on me and see me fall, and that's alarmin'
You just hopin' I'ma tarnish
You don't want me to be nothin'
You don't wanna open doors for me
You did a lil' somethin', but you could've did a lil' more for me
No wonder why your father turned his back on you, unfortunately
No wonder why your niggas set them traps on you to sorcery
You ain't nothin' but a phony, you a liar, you a snake
And you can rap but you ain't Kendrick, you ain't Cole, you ain't Drake
Can't believe I called you family, I should shoot you in the face
Used to act like you was real, but always knew that you was fake
You let the fame get to your head and all it did was made you whack
I always knew the day would come when you would stab me in my back
One day, your money gon' be gone and I'll be happy, that's a fact
And then you'll move back to the hood and I'll be laughin' when you back
But you my nigga and I love you
And I wanna see you win, I wouldn't place no one above you
And you always been my friend since we was steppin' in the puddles
Real niggas don't pretend 'cause you're my brother, you my double
You my motherfuckin' twin, and I wanna let you know how I appreciate the things you show me
It's kind of hard to trust niggas, that's why I keep you closely
And look, I know that I don't tell you often, maybe not even at all
But I'm so proud of you and your success, broski""

I don't care if you knew each other since you was kids""
Bitch, I don't care if your little brother is cool with his
I'm the shit, oh shit, where the noise at?
Everybody got a squad, can't avoid that
Niggas screaming ""Gang gang gang,"" oh yeah
But when the shit hit the fan, where your boys at?
Oh shit, oh shit, I don't have a Visa
I think I'ma fall in love with a ballerina
Just let me hit it and I ain't waitin' for marriage neither
Cause she gon' fall and I'ma ball like alopecia
Heh, I said I go bald like alopecia
I turned to God and then read the Bible and grabbed the heater
I want a mansion in Hollywood and Pasadena
But I still ain't got shit and I ain't too happy neither
And everything was all good just a week ago
I heard some shit about you, I ain't believe it though
Cause I don't listen to the gossip or tea and go
And treat your differently cause niggas wanted me to know
Huh, yeah that's for you to guess and me to know
And shorty said I'm cold hearted, my shit three below
Yeah I just ran into the bank, give me all the bread
I ain't really want to do it but I need the dough
Oh shit, here we go again
Make sure you take them clothes off, bitch I'm going in
But you gon' take this dick while I press record
And tonight you my slave, don't you ever tell me no again
(*Crying*) Shut the fuck up, hoe
Look, don't you ever tell me no again
Bitch I'm possessive and I'll never let you go again
But who hittin' you phone at two in the morning?
And I had to tell that nigga, ""Don't you ever text my hoe again""
Woo! Yeah, don't you ever text my hoe again
Cause I'm possessive and I'll never let you go again
Hah, don't you ever call my phone again

[Verse 1]
Now I be lying if I, I be
Now I be lying if I told you I ain't trying to get rich
I need mines, I need grind, ain't no time for no bitch
I'm surprised I'm alive, oh my god, take him up
Make him fly, break him even
They been sleeping, wake them up
They got molly, they got bands, I got fans, I got ooh
I got dro, I got grams, I got damn, I got blow, hoe
I got what you need, homie don't raise your voice at me my G
All these eyes on me, I see, that's word to Pac and B.I.G. I be, I be
On stages, and ain't there nowhere I got to go
I ain't got no fucking patience that's one thing you got to know
All these rappers in my way, they think they famous, I don't know
When I watch them hit the pavement I'ma feel like Holly Holms
I swear it don't get no better than this
I told my bitch we better get rich
Then flip these chips and get a new whip
And twist my wrist in front of ya, none of ya
Want to get pimped you son of a prick, let's flip this win and then uh
Jump in the air
I just want to dig a hole in a cell
I just want to say Hello to Adele
See Joyner Lucas LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like[Bridge]
Yeah yeah whooh whooh
I just want to let you know that I'm here
I just want to sing a song and a prayer
I just want to make a toast to El Chapo
My idol, I might dig a hole in a cell
I should probably change my hoe to affair
I could probably make your hoe disappear
Different emotions you don't know what to feel

[Verse 2]
Always feel like my jeans burning
No bail and I'm seen murdering
New gold grills and your teeth hurt
I'm still walking and my feet hurt
Where's Uber when you need one?
Just tell me where you see one
I'm driving bars on the wall
Okay, where's Luda when you need her?
Listen, I'm my back to the wall
Then I'm back to the zone, I'm in a Twilight
If you ever get a minute tell them other little niggas I've been winning I've been doing it from hindsight
Don't you ever get a pen in on my level never said I'm not a rebel don't you ever get on my mic
And you ever been a kid and been a winner by the niggas and the pen I'ma end 'em in the limelight rhyme-light
I'm like, I'm like
Swish swish whooh
I'm like eh ya hoe, there I go
I'ma kill the game this year
Say I won't, may I? Woo
I don't give a fuck about no haters or what I never did
I got angels here and that's evident
I got halos all in my head I swear

[Verse 3]
Got what you need, this that 24-hour spot
This that Massachusetts, Kawasaki, and the Yamaha
My Mama, Auntie, told me if I ever started drama
I can go to jail
But fuck the cops
And tell the judge to suck my cock and go to hell
No filter, but I got real love
Niggas ain't real son, tryna get meals but
Everyone's still friends, she don't got heels on
But her ass still fat, bet if I hit that she gonna tear up
Where are my real thugs, when they gonna hear us, when they gonna feel us?
Everyone act cray
Don't know what make they way
I tell your bitch: ay baby
Poppa can't crip stand
They ball so hard since wristbands
So my broads ain't got no implants, these bras ain't got no kickstands, and I know it though
Hold up
Fuck what you feel
I just want to sell salt to a snail
I just want to sell a hoe to a queer
I just want to go to Oprah and Phil
Give them both a little coke and some pills
I remember when I had to scrape a little change just to go to the store for some milk
I remember when my ex bitch didn't come home, she was stroking the field
I don't think you really know how I feel
I don't think you niggas know how to chill, whooh
So, the fuck is you thinking you older than me?
You got some type of control over me?
Just cause you got some shit you can hold over me, like you running this shit?
Act like I won't put my tongue in your bitch
Bring her closer to me
And then go to the beach, sit in the water
Don't act like you not an emotional creep
I pull over the jeep (skrrt, skrrt)
[Bridge]
I just want to let you know that I'm here
I just want to sing a song and a prayer
I just want to make a toast to El Chapo
My idol, I might dig a hole in a cell
I just want to say Hello to Adele
I could probably make your hoe disappear
I don't think you niggas know how it feels

Look, pour me a drink
I don't do liquor, I know what you think
This is a vibe
This that shit that make niggas get fly and go on a date
Fly to Dubai, order a steak
I got a shawty, she told me she loved me
I know that she mean it, don't know what to say
She want a nigga to go all the way
She want a—
She want that feelin' that she on a mission to find what she missin'
She need the commitment but don't wanna wait
I need a break, I need (A break)
She need a hubby
I wish I could love like I did in my twenties
I wish I was me back when I had no money
I wish I could give her all that she want from me
And I know it hurts (Yeah)
I got a diamond, don't know what it's worth
Don't know what is worse
Sleepin' alone or sleepin' with someone you know you gon' hurt
Layin' with somеone you know that you killin'
And deep down inside, you know that she willin' to stay and just ridе
Just hopin' that one day this shit'll be fine
But what if it isn't? Or what if I'm wrong?
What am I missin'? Where do I belong?
She got a vision and I never listen
I think I been lookin' for somethin' that never existed
I'm dealin' with scars that never be fixin'
I know that I'm guilty of every conviction (Yeah)
Now how can I look in the mirror and talk to myself
When I know I ain't ready to listen or ready to fix it? (Woo)

I just packed the ride (Woo)

I ain't perfect, but I try
She said, “That's a lie
You know you just sabotage” (Hey)
Girl, you cold
You know I'm in love with you but I ain't done bein' a ho

[Verse 2]
I got a shawty beside of me (Woo)
She ain't got shit that she proud of me (Hey)
She never trip up or lie to me
She never bicker or brother me (Buck)
I got a bitch with a Rolls-Royce
She wanna pull up beside of me (Woah)
She never get in my way
And don't ever complain about spendin' no time with me
I got a, I got a shawty that give me up (Hey)
I don't need no one to trip me up (Yeah)
Too many hoes wanna keep me down
I got a bitch that'll pick me up
She wanna suck me and lick me up (Woah)
I got a ho that'll spoil me
Treat me like royalty
I gotta live it up (Woah)
None of these women can get enough
I got a, I got a shawty with hella ambition
Somebody who trust and believe in my vision
And keep to herself and don't be in my business
Won't talk to nobody, not even my niggas (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I swear that her booty's a heavy addiction
I just wanna hit it in every position
I'm very consistent
I don't wanna cuddle, she very submissive with every decision (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And shawty a boss
She got my, she got my back and she ‘bout it (Yeah)
If I try to pay for the bill, she tell me, “Don't worry, my nigga, I got it” (Got it)
Baddest lil' bitch in the Hills, her body amazin', I'm talkin' exotic (You heard?)
Shawty be cookin' me meals and fuckin' me crazy
I'm talkin' demonic, I'm talkin' neurotic
But I ain't in love with these bitches, I'm not gonna reach (Woo, woo, woo)
I hate that the woman I love has gotta compete (Woo, woo, woo)
But I'm tryna figure the reason I’m incomplete
Nobody perfect and not even me
I figured all of these hoes can solve the problem, well maybe the problem is me
[Bridge]
Hey, babe (Hey, babe)
I just found love and I never had a love like you

I've got this darkness in my soul
Don't see no light when I'm wide awake
I'm sick of workin' for no ends
You see the greed made me feel hate
And there's no turnin' back, no
Keep runnin' from my past
Well, the fear, it always lasts
I don't think you know me, know me, no
You don't know my life, my heart, my soul, no
If you've seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen, see things I've seen

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Black women hurt, black women curse
Black brothers doin' black women dirt
Black women cryin', black women murk
We can never put a black woman first
Black lives matter, black lives scatter
Black eyes under black eye shadow
Black blood made a black life splatter
Black sister had a black life shadow
Black single mother, black favorite color
Black brother made a black woman suffer
Black women down, black women under
We contribute to the black women struggle
Black women brave, black women save
Black women lost, black women fade
Black man with a black woman
Made black paint, made a black woman change
Black women cryin', black women tired
Tears runnin' down a black woman's eye
Black women run, black women hide
Black violence made a black woman die
Black woman passed, black mama sad
Black pride on a black woman had
Black rage for the black women, mad
Black man callin' black women trash
Black women hurt, let you back in
Black women keep protectin' black men
Black men don't protect the black queen
Black women always get the back seat

Black resurrected, black manifested
Black women vision, black innovation
Black women faith, black women blessings
Black man keep the black queen protected
Black women safe, black women save
Black business is a black women paid
Black don't crack, black don't age
Black women proud, black women praised
Black women smilin', black women shinin'
Black women got it, black women write it
Black wealth, no more back to the bottom
Black kings get a black woman diamonds
Black women body, black women climbin'
Black women body, black women poppin'
Black men keep the black woman honored
Black roses painted back and they got 'em
Black loyalty, black royalty
Black novelty, black odyssey
Black women in a black colony
Black women feelin' black harmony
Black for the people, black women peaceful
Black man treatin' black women equal
Backbone what a black women teach you
Black strength when a black woman feed you
Black pride, that's what's happenin' now

Black women gettin' cash and I'm proud
Black angels and they trapped in the clouds

[​​​Verse 1]
That was last year
Now I'm living in the ghetto with the crackheads
Working at McDonald's as a goddamn cashier
Ain't this a bitch? (Ain't this a bitch?)
Liquor got me lightheaded (Yeah)
Sippin' to the light red and
I ain't go to college, I ain't good at nothing else
So if this don't work out then I wonder where my life headed
I ain't got shit
Tired of being stranded
Gotta go and get it
Living in hell, that's a heaven full of bitches
And I'm scared to fall in love but I never will admit it
Shit, I never could'a did it (never)
Point me to the door, I gotta leave
Real cocky to them hoes that say hi to me
Like I'm the best thing you heard
Bitch don't lie to me, don't you lie to me
I tried to play the lottery
Maybe I can hit the Powerball
Cop 50 fly cars, and then drive them all
Just so I can feel like a rich nigga got it all (This nigga got it all)
Bitch you ain't shit, and these broads ain't loyal
Hoes won't relate but these songs ain't for you

And the game ain't the same, so along came Joyner
Standing around like you don't get the fuckin' picture
Let me paint it for you, I ain't playin' witchu
Waiting for the Illuminati just so I can get a check
Here's my soul let me trade it to you

[Chorus]
'Cause what the fuck do I gotta do to go and buy me a mansion? (Huh)
Fuck is this? (Fuck is this?)
I wasn't supposed to be broke for this long, goddamnit (Shit)
What a bitch (What a bitch)
I said my manager told me, ""Nigga, you gon' be rich"" (Said you gon' be rich)
Yeah right, I need a mansion on the water
And a yacht for my momma
Throwing party while we're bumping Barry White
Nigga, I just want a mansion (Look where he's from, I'm tired of this man)
I just want a mansion (I can't eat, I'm broke nigga, I'm broke, and you got the power to change that)

[Verse 2]
Yo, what the fuck do I gotta do to go and buy me a mansion? (Huh?)
Fuck is this? (Fuck is this?)
I wasn't supposed to be broke for this long, goddamnit (What the fuck?)
What a bitch (What a bitch)
And my manager told me, ""Joyner, you gon' be rich"" (Nigga, you gon' be rich)
A year later, now I'm living in the ghetto with the haters
Working at Denny's as a motherfucking waiter, nigga
Ain't this a bitch? (Ain't this a bitch?)
Liquor got me lightheaded
Sippin' to the light red and
I ain't really got no damn back up plan
So if this don't work out, then I wonder where my life headed
I ain't got shit (I ain't got shit)
Tired of being broke, gotta get it all, plus a nigga need drawers
Gotta hit the mall
Ain't no cameras in the stores so I bend the law (I gotta bend the law)
Point me to the door (Yeah)
I'm winning now
Yeah, I'm tryna get some head
Bitch, it's been a while
And don't be acting brand new cause your friends around ('Cause your friends around)
I'm tryna hit the lotto, thirty million and deposit all
Cop a mansion with a safe and I hide it all
Just so I can feel like a rich nigga got it all
This nigga got it all, it's all paranoia, I got a call from my lawyer
I should've went to prison but the bars ain't for ya
[Pre-Chorus]
And the game ain't the same, so along came Joyner

She say I think with my dick and she probably right
And it's Friday night
And he gon' do whatever when he feeling good
But girl I promise you that me and him are not alike
I swear he 'bout to be the death of me, I can't fight it
And he gon' do whatever when he feel like it
I tried to teach him 'bout relationships and he don't like it
And he gon' go inside whoever when he feel invited
I had a conversation with him from the get go
He said ""Nigga calm down let me finish, yo
Don't understand why you acting like a bitch, though
Ain't nothing wrong with a little bit of sex, hoe
You ain't gotta stress yo"", my nigga, listen, you a part of me
You get me in trouble then you fall asleep
And all it takes is some liquor and some R&B
But you gon' fuck around and turn me into Charlie Sheen
Look nigga, I've been getting teased while the guys get played
Sweating in your jeans all goddamn day
Tryna feel a little breeze you can get a little wet
Go swimming 'til she screams, make her feel it in her chest
Love a bitch that'll suck me and swallow your kids up
Kiss me on my eyes while she tyin' her hair up
Then give a massage as I lay it down
Shit I could do this all night, I don't play around
My nigga, you don't ever take your time so it never lasts
You sabotage every chick I ever had
When you see another chick you say goddamn
The blood rushin' to your head and then you dive in
And you willin' to say whatever just to get some
You better hope that I don't ever fuckin' catch none
Cause you a dirty motherfucker you should listen to me
Or I'ma have to cut you off, literally

I've been thinkin' with my dick, baby I ain't got control
I try to fight it but he got a mind of his own
I've been thinkin with my dick but I'm tired of these hoes
And this is my confession, I can't lie anymore
I've been thinkin' with my dick, baby I ain't got control
I try to fight it but he got a mind of his own
I've been thinkin' with my dick but I'm tired of these hoes
And this is my confession, I can't lie anymore

[Verse 2]
She say I think with my dick and she probably right
Yeah it's Friday night
And he gon' do whatever when he feeling good
But girl I promise you that me and him are not alike
He sayin' ""Hi, hello"" and got a thing for Adele
He got a mind of his own, he really think for himself
It's hard to keep him happy, he a heavy hitter
When bitches call him daddy then his head get bigger
I had a conversation with him, had to set him straight
He said ""Nigga calm down, homie listen, J
Ain't nothin' wrong with some pussy and a little brains
Besides I don't really know if this is just a phase
And I don't mean to be rude or to hate though
But I get bored when I'm in and out the same hoe
The same pussy every night I'mma lay low
And I could care less if she keep her fuckin legs closed
I love a bitch that'll suck me and swallow your kids up
Kiss me on my eyes while she tyin' her hair up
Then give a massage as I lay it down
And as soon as I'm done with her, I'ma make my rounds
And you don't ever take your time so it never lasts
Plus you sabotaged every bitch I ever had
And you ain’t even being safe, you fuck it you lazy
And as soon as you fuck up, then I'm stuck with a baby
And I hope that you know you givin' me a bad reputation
All because you don't know how to relax and be patient
Now these bitches trippin' they gettin' mad at me blatant
They call me a bunch of names, that's some bad defamation
And today I'm gettin' checked at the fuckin' clinic
And if I got somethin' then I know who fuckin' did it
Cause ever since the other day, I kinda feel a little burn when I'm pissin'
And if I got somethin' I hope my girl don't get it, hold up
Uh, yeah

You got some scary intentions
Your brain is clouded with too many possessions
You think you rich but you depressing yourself
It's just so pathetic and materialistic
And all you do is flash your money and fortune
You ride around in that Ferrari and Porsches
And all you talk about is Bugatti and foreigns
You walk around like you somebody important
You surrounded by leaches and beggars
And none of them niggas wanna see you do better
I bet they plotting, wanna see what you got
Cause you brag a lot and make it seem like they jealous
So what the fuck you even see in the mirror?
Your future couldn't really be any clearer
And when it rains, you gon' need an umbrella
But you don't listen, you don't see it or hear it

You think you rich but you depressing yourself
It's just so pathetic and materialistic
I really think that all them drugs got you tripping
Your brain is ruined and your logic is different
I know that syrup got your body in shivers
If I was you, I'd get that out of my system
And I think that you bugging and stuff
You just shit on everyone who's stuck in a rut
Always flash your money out in public and stunt
And we all just look at you in fucking disgust
Maybe you're just insecure with no luck
And deep down you're a dub without nothing to love
And I wonder if you'll ever realize what's up
And be humble and just say enough is enough

And none them niggas wanna see me do better
I bet they plottin', want to take what I got
Cause I brag a lot and make it seem like they jealous

[Verse 1]
It's the type of shit that make a nigga hide behind a heater
Type of shit that make a nigga aim the choppa out the Beamer (Oh, oh, oh)
Used to be the underdog, now I'm rockin' out arenas
Everything I touch is water and I got it by the litre (Oh, oh)
This is not a Aquafina, this PH3
Tell your offsprings, I'm D-A-D (Boom, boom)
And your bitch say I'm her B-A-E
And I love it when she give me H-E-A-D
She know I'ma kill that C-A-T (Hey)
Bandana tied like P-A-C (Hey)
I don't even get high off THC
I got a natural vibe, ADHD
I've been B-A-D since I was like two (Facts)

And I ain't wanna do it, but that's what they ask for
Niggas ask for so much that I had to act poor
And I might just sleep on the Maybach floor
I got a safe big enough to put a fuckin' backdoor (Boom, boom, boom)
I got a Wraith big enough to put a fuckin' RAV4
Way before I had a Lambo, used to push a rad Ford (Boom, boom)
Record labels had my demo, they would push it fast forward
Now I make so much money, that I'm startin' to act bored (Oh)

Rest in peace Mac Miller, yeah
Joyner, yeah
Joyner, Joyner (Look, look)

[Chorus]
I used to pray for shit like this when I was seventeen (Okay)
Hit the block and made a plan, I hope it set me free (Uh-huh)
Turn that girl into a freak she thought she'd never be (Let's go)
If she ain't with no freaky shit, then she ain't meant for me (Ayy, ayy)
I just hit a lick and made a flip and bought me seven piece (Uh-huh)
Copped the whip, I had to stunt on haters, rest in peace (Rest in peace)
Glad I made it out the bricks, I thought I'd never leave (Oh, yeah)
Never knew that gettin' richer would make me enemies (Woah, woah)
Crazy how I look up to my idols, now they check for me (Ayy, ayy)
Fuck relationships, I need a bitch to count some checks with me (Ayy, ayy)
I don't need no ho to blow my phone or keep on pressin' me (Joyner)
If you never liked me, I just hope you keep that energy (Woah, woah)

[Verse 1]
They never knew that one day all this shit I be dreamin' about, I'd be livin' it (Ayy)
Jumped out the window and took the advantage, I know my potential is limitless (Joyner)
Never respected a fuck nigga poppin' that shit then they run to the internet (Ayy)
Runnin' your mouth when I'm runnin' a check up, I'm feelin' my money's unlimited (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I bet that shit kinda funny now, isn't it?
I know that karma don't come with the benefit (Woah)
I got no faith in the new generation, the rappers are fuckin' illiterate (Woah)
I know that timin' is money, I learn how to watch all the suckers I spend it wit'
I don't need love, but my gun it's attentive
You wanna start it? Then fuck it, I finish it (Grr, baow, baow)
I know that all of you Crips is targets
I gotta push the margin
I told my ho, ""I don't need you""
I'ma be good regardless
Straight from the hood apartments
I did my dirt and then took the charges
You wanted smoke and I wish to spark it
They never knew I was good at arson (Yeah, yeah)
Even when nobody got me, fuck it, I got me though (I got me)
Who am I supposed to look up to when I grew up on The Cosby Show? (Yeah)
Who am I supposed to fuck to now that a nigga won't listen to Kells? (Woah)
Crazy when niggas done did it, they selves (Woah, woah, woah, damn, ayy, ayy, ayy)

I had to fend for myself, ain't have no one to talk when niggas was talkin' to God
I never been one to talk to the cops, lot of these niggas be talkin' a lot (Woah, woah, woah)

Me and my niggas outside of the crib, blowin' the smoke and rollin' a few
Shootin' some dice and makin' it flip, we gettin' it lit, you know it what it do (Yeah, yeah)
One of my homies said, ""I got a question, I wanna know, like what would you choose
If you had twenty-four hours to live then where would you go? And what would you do?"" (Grr)

[Refrain]
I'm 'bout to catch a few felonies
Load up the trunk and then head to the Beverly's
Hop out the whip and then rob a celebrity
Take all his shit and then steal his identity (Grrah)
Strap on a vest and go kill all my enemiеs
Slap any hater that showed any jealousy

[Verse 1]
Shoot еvery broski that tried to get next to me (Yeah)
After this shit, they all gonna remember me (Grrah)
Stick up the bag and then empty the drawer (Empty the drawer)
Get in the floor
Take from the rich and then give to the poor
Give them the shit that they couldn't afford (Yeah)
Buy 'em all cribs and then give 'em a tour (Give 'em a tour, skrrt)
Whippin' a Porsche
Skrrt on the cops, ain't no flippin' the law
Bury the opps and then dig up the corpse
Throw me a party with all of the bros and then turn every day to a holiday (Holiday)
I'll have an orgy with all of the hoes who ain't never wan' give me the time of day (Time of day)
Catch 'em all lackin' and kidnap you rappers who told the police and cooperate (Cooperate)
Break into prison and free all the hitters and give all them niggas a lobster plate (Let's go)
Pull up to the fuckin' White House with an AK
Go inside and cut the lights out then I make way (Yeah)
Tell the government to pipe down, we don't play safe
Everybody on the block now get a payday
Stay ready and I'm on the prowl with a straight blade
Guaranteed the shit'll go down like a mayday
Make 'em renovate the whole hood then I vacate
Lot of niggas doin' no good but they maintain
I'ma gun down every pedophile
Wonder if I'll get to heaven now, I'm a criminal
I'll take every dead beat daddy, put 'em in the ground (Woah)
Niggas actin' like they been around but they in and out (Yeah)

I got pain in my soul (Way to go)
And I ain't prayed in so long (I said way to go, uh)
Jesus can't save me no more (Way to go)
It's the end of the road

[Interlude]
You feel like the world is against you
You feel like you had a bad case of the ""can't help it""
You feel like sometimes all hope is gone
And every time you wanted to do good
Evil was always prevalent on you, you hear me?
He came to kill, steal and destroy your soul
And now you look at yourself
And you say, ""I just got pain in my soul""

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Uh, I ain't felt this way since Wednesday
I brought a switchblade to 6th grade
Way before Myspace and Sam-space
I had a crush on Beyoncé and Kim K
I went to work late and missed out
My Grandma told me, ""In ten days, you kicked out""
Never went to Sunday school, I skipped out
And then went to the mall and got draped up and dripped out
I used to listen to Bon Jovi
And hang with my Aunt Rosie, then she called the cops on me
Crack in my socks runnin', my neighbor up top sold me
Nowhere to run now, thanks a lot homie
Misunderstood, trust me, I know what you took from me
She said, ""I know you in a relationship and you couldn't love me
And you know we got something and you know it's time
So what you waitin' for?
Goddamn, you let me down again, way to go""

I came to tell you tonight that there's good news
That Jesus came to save you from all of your sins
And he came to wash it away with his blood
The enemy came to steal, kill and destroy your soul
And now all you can do is that in your soul
Is that there is nothing but pain

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
Uhh, niggas just throw fits, I'm so sick
I'm tired of my broke friends who smoke cigs
I just want a gold Benz with with smoked tints
And take all of my hoes on a road trip, just no kids
I guess it's cool to dream when you ain't used to havin' much
I know this break-up hurtin' you and you sad and such
I know you not happy, stop actin' like you havin' fun
I know you snoopin' through my Instagram gettin' mad as fuck
I tried to run away from home before the ass beatings
All I wanted was some clothes when it's tax season
I love it when they Black but they act 'Rican
My pastor think that I'm half-Black and half-demon
What the fuck is you cryin' for? What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine and I'm down for it, we ridin' for it
We wanted this a long time ago, what you waitin' for?
Goddamn, you let me down again (Way to go)

Buh, buh, buh
Brrrat

[Verse 1]
Can't catch me when I'm too damn fast
Skrrt, ayy, you can't last
Worked too hard just to turn back now
If they don't like me, that's too damn bad (Ayy)
Bitch, don't touch what you can't have (Yuh)
Yeah, you can't have
Just 'cause I fuck, don't mean she mine
I tossed that bitch with a two-hand pass
I just tied up Khaled, now I got the keys
Straight from the block, I hop out the P's (Brrat, brrat)
Joyner got niggas that'll hop out and squeeze (Brrat, brrat)
Leave a nigga jumpin' out his Dada Supremes (Brrrrrrat)
I gotta breathe (Huff)
I don't get enough credit, bitch, shout out to me
Snitch ass bitch just brought out the D's (Skr)
Wu-Tang shit, I brought out the Bees
Ayy, worked too hard to go back to the days where I made just a minimum wage, what's that? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I need head three times a day, if not we ain't on the same page, what's that?
Google fucking up my net worth, say I got two, three M's to my name, what's that?
Nigga, I done made at least twenty M's, bitch, better fix that shit, I'm paid, what's that? (Brrt, brrt)
This a flex, this ain't a pissin' test (Skr)
Fuck the disrespect, I gotta interject
I gotta lift the weight, tell all my bench to press (Okay)
My life been the shit, you niggas been depressed
You either misdirected or you incorrect
I got a Smith & Wesson, let it rip your flesh
And let it split your neck until you missing sections
I'm an evil curse inside a bigger blessing, nigga (Brrat, ayy)

I don't even smoke, nigga and I'm-
I feel like smoking today

[Verse 2]
Ayy, back in the days, I was nickel and dimin'
They want my soul, but won't give me a diamond
I want it all, I'ma dig in your pockets
She wanna fuck me to get in my wallet (Woah)
My rims are clean, they be sitting in comet
I'm 'bout to count all my commas in private
Our bank account ain't got nothin' in common, nigga (Look)
And your common sense don't make cents with my commas
If you got no sense or no commas don't comment
Bitch, I'm so wavy, I live on a island
Nah, scratch that
I'm floatin' on stars and eatin' some ramen
I'm not from this world, I got houses on comets, I promise
Yeah, I been trappin' out the motherfuckin' hallway
Niggas ain't learn, now they gotta learn the hard way (Woo)
Empty my clip like John Wayne
Niggas wanna play, they must think it's a broadway (Ooo)
Oh, you want beef? That's okay
Bitch, it's a wrap, that's word to Chipotle (Uh)
Lock shit down like probate
In your bitch mouth, that's word to Colgate (Mmm)
I kept the nine up in my momma crib (Bah)
Was sellin' nickels and dimes, then the Klonopins (Bah)
I had the juice on my mind, thought I was Radames (Bah)
I kept some niggas in line, they knew what time it is (Bah, bah)
I can never go back to the times when I was packagin' (Bah)
Tryin' to get out the back of the projects where my auntie live (Bah, bah)
Up in the trap or apartments, couldn't sit back and recline (Bah, bah)
'Cause up in the back of my mind I knew it was a matter of time before I die (Bah, brrat)

Cyborg (Cyborg)
Niggas wonder why I got a different color eye for (Aye)
My Lord (My Lord)
Terminator Lucas knock a nigga off his high horse (Pew)
Sky born (Skrrt)
I'm the type of nigga that honest bitches'll lie for
I'm the type of nigga that all you bitches'll die for
I'm the type of drug that a sober bitch'll get high for (Brrrat, ayy)

You want a lawyer, just send me your Zelle

Count it up, I had to climb them stairs
This for my niggas locked down in a cell

Man I wish these hoes could see me now, things changed
I remember when I used to beg for change

[Verse 1]
I done came a long way from the block where these birds got their hands out
Remember lil me? Guess what, motherfucker? I'm the man now
She used to hang up on a nigga when I called, that was year 'round
Now the same bitch wanna give me good brains with her hair down
And that's funny, and my ex wanna call me, saying that she wanna have me
Talking 'bout ""When we getting married?""
Bitch you need to find another pappy, and haters don't look too happy
Swear it's my fault, you done turned me to a monster
Fly ass truck, I'm a Tonka, and I ain't really into the drama
I'd rather get paid, period, no comma
Mind your damn business, homie what you saying?
I done came up, fuck is you talking 'bout? I'm just working
Fuck is you thinking? I got some hurt for the niggas
I got some pork for the bacon, if it ain't bones that I'm breaking
And I was born on probation, they pulled me over to take me
Inside the border, they drained me and cut me open and gave me
Some fuckin' potion I'm craving, dammit, look what you made me
I'm just going

[Hook]
Look what I became from where they found me
I think you should take a look around me

[Verse 2]
Uhh, I done came a long way from the stoop where the fiends got their hands out
Remember lil old me? Guess what, motherfucker? I'm the man now
He used to run his mouth 'bout me all around the hood, it was man down
And now the same nigga want a fucking autograph, he a fan now
And that's funny, now my ex girl calling saying that she tryna see us
Talking 'bout ""Where we gonna meet up?""
Bitch you need to find another re-up, and haters wanna see me get beat up
Yeah it's my fault, it done turned me to a psycho
Ass so fat she need lipo, and I ain't really into the titles
Rather get insurance on the pussy, no Geico
Mind your own business, homie what you saying?
I done came up, fuck is you talking 'bout? I'm just working
Fuck is you wishing, I got some dirt for the pigeons
I got some work for the business so write my words on the ceiling
I hope I'm hurting your feelings, they pulled me over, I went in
Inside the border to check in, they cut me open and gave me
Some fuckin' potion or medicine, dammit look what you made me
I'm just going

But I think you should take a look around me

[Verse 3]
I used to get mad when the hoes ain't flock
I used to get bullied by the whole damn block
Running from the boys, hope I don't get caught
Niggas had guns, hope I don't get shot
Lord, oh Lord can you answer my prayer?
Beautiful dreams and these weird nightmares
Standin in blood with a pair of Nike Airs
I'm just tryna get a buzz, I'm the real light year
Ho point me to the door, I'm catching my breath
Blood on my blood, and flesh on my flesh
My heart might stop but I'll stretch you out, yes
Machiavelli and Pac, resurrecting my death
And I'm back as a hologram, Jesus must be inside of him
What you riding in? Wanna talk about ice and Beamers?
Get your shit broke like Ike and Tina
I was born on the seventeenth day
Along came Joyner, in Heaven we pray
Born by the pussy I'll die by the pussy
That just means that I could never be gay
Take a look around me, me, you floss too much
And talk about how you just a boss too much
I swear I love winning cause I lost too much
I wanted Drake on the hook but he cost too much
Fuck I look like lying then? I'm a pyro's pirate
Set the hood on fire, hit the hydrants
Guess I'm just a product of my environment
And that's word, flashbacks to my teacher in class
Telling me she hope that I don't finish high school
All I know is I came a long way
And I'll be God damned if I ever stop soon
[Hook]
Look what I became from where they found me

Know what it's like to be half nigga, just a half nigga (yeah)
My white Mom fell in love with a black nigga (damn)
Just a black nigga
A white lady with a colored kid
I don't even understand what my color is
What my color is (what my color is)
Black, White, Brown, and some other shit
Homie say you ain't allowed with us
I don't even want you hanging out with us (nah)
And quit trying to act like you proud of us
If we were slaves back then, you'd be a house nigga
A house nigga (a house nigga)
Wow nigga, know what I hate the most
A bunch of cartoons with some racist quotes
And subliminal messages and racist jokes
Kinda funny how the money not ours (money not ours)
Yeah the money not ours
All the white motherfuckers got power (damn)
While the black motherfuckers got talent
Trying to get respect that'll never be valid (never be valid)
Never be valid
Even if you had level 3 clearance (yeah)
Even if you had Hillary's parents (yeah)
Even if you were a rap star (rap star)
Even if you had 10 cars and
Even if you had a Red Porsche and a 747 with 10 floors and the best whores
Even if you were a ball player, playing for the Clippers
Just imagine how you would feel if you were Doc Rivers
With a boss like the racist motherfucker Donald Sterling
I've been in and out of feelings, how sad is it (how sad is it shit)
Yeah how bad is it, when your boss got billions of cash and shit
And you stuck at the bottom you ain't half as rich
Fighting to be equal in the battle with
Another race in this land full of happiness
Another day trying to race to establish this
Another way, gotta wait for an activist to come say how we feel
Ain't that some shh.. (ain't that some shit) ain't that some shit
But meanwhile I got morals to stand up for
Can't cause I got a daughter to man up for
Gotta bite my tongue (gotta bite my tongue)
While the life is young if you a black entertainer it'd be nice
To run this shit, but you not shit till the fight is done
And that's just with the icing on the cake
If we didn't break, we'd be twice as strong (twice as strong)
But now it's twice as hard
To be a half nigga living in this life of darkness
All the black kids looking at me like I'm awkward
Cause I'm too light to be on one side of the streets
Now I play both parts, like hide and go seek
Malcolm X gave hope of getting out of the streets
And Rosa Parks was never getting out of her seat
I guess we here for life (here for life)
And I heard Mr. Sterling got banned for life, from the NBA
And He can sell the team
If that don't take away the heat from his self esteem
We in a helpless scene and a helpless time
With no help, trying to help decide, if we in hell or a jail
Can't yell or cry, can't scream or tell
But they can tell us lies nigga

Ayy, ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Yeah, look (Ayy)

[Verse]
I ain't been on my freestyle shit in a minute but niggas don't put no respect
So tell all these rappers that I'm takin' over, just so you know what to expect
I wasn't gon' do it at first but fuck it, I must keep my foot on they neck
If I give you a warning, you better believe me, you know I stay good on my threats
Nigga, I spent my whole life in the studio, shit kinda feel like I'm doin' a stretch
I wish I could spend more time with my son but I know that I'm doin' the best
And I know that it's worth it when he look at mе and say, ""Daddy, look, you are the best""
Need to find a nеw way to deal with my anger 'cause I never do good with stress
Niggas hate when I brag, I know, when I talk about cash, I know
When I talk about cars, I know, all the bitches I have, I know
They say, ""J, I miss when you was broke
Way before all the fame and glory
Money changed you, it made you corny
The material things just bore me
You're no different than all of these industry niggas, I thought you were special and awesome
Now you sellin' your soul and just hopin' on records with anyone, nigga, you lost it
I miss when you made music that I could relate to 'cause all of your new shit ain't thoughtful
When you gon' make some new music with Marshall?
When you gon' pull some new shit out the arsenal?""
I'm back on my remix shit, don't sue me, nigga, I'm too unruly
I might slide on a hoe like Toosie, bitch, I'm too dang groovy, ooh
Niggas try and cancel me like Boosie, all y'all hoes is goofy
But, yeah, you know my life's a movie, I sold crack to Pookie
Look, she in love with the cocaine, I'm in love with the dope gang
Try to cook crack with a oven and propane
Try to make a dollar back when I ain't have no name
But niggas told me that I had to stay in my own lane
I jumped in the water and started makin' my own wave
I'm watchin' the pool splash, they told me don't move fast
And every nigga doin' better than me, I blew past
Now niggas look at me, like, ""How the fuck did he do that?""
I got one crib, I don't live in it
The other one is big enough to probably put my other muhfuckin' crib in it
But one crib, I made a clubhouse and stuffed all my step kids in it
And then I built me a trap house and let all the fiends take a hit in it
And I might buy a church too, just in case I wanna sin it
Put a hot tub in the front row, let all my hoes come swim in it
Yeah, I made so much bread, I bought a crib to take a shit in it
You talk about it, I'm livin' it, you brag about it, I been did it
And I got your bitch in the whip ridin' shotgun with the ceiling down
You let her down, I feel her up just 'cause the bitch feelin' down
I don't know if her ass real but I do know that it's really round
I think that I'm tall enough for her to give me head without kneelin' down
Fake niggas only really lie just because of prolly how real it sounds
Please shut the fuck up anytime I bring somebody real around
You versus me, nigga? That's like a whale pushin' a seal around
Tell me, how many dead rappers you think it takes to fill the ground?
And bitch, I'm in pimp mode, I only know what the pimps know
The man in the mirror is schizo, I pay a stripper in crypto
I pay a stripper in crypto, I do not care if you lit, though
I hit my plug from the flip phone, I'm sellin' pebbles to Flinstones
Scam nightly, sellin' whatever the strand might be, yeah
Get like me, all of my packages sealed tightly, yeah
I had a record deal, then I drop a label, nigga, come take a chance like me
You niggas cannot advance like me, you'll give Atlantic back the advance like me
I got the upper hand, mm, and I got the other hand icy
My diamonds movin' like Chris Brown, you know I love when they dance hyphy
Ayy, ayy, only nigga that told his girlfriends 'bout my other girlfriends in front of my side lil' bitch and wifey
Give a fuck about security in the club, we gon' ride
Give a fuck if it's a quarantine or not, we still outside
The last nigga tried to play me talkin' crazy, then he died
Like them cheap-ass hoes [?], catch you slippin', we gon' slide
Ooh, ooh, catch you slippin', we gon' slide
Put that rubber on that grip, then we gon' cut your ass outside
Send 'em goonies on that mission, it go trip and you gon' hide
When you get hit that blicky you gon' wish that you done died

[Verse 1]
By the system I was raised
Same system that enslaved us and took us all away
Same same system I was trained to put my hands across my heart and pledge allegiance to the grave
The same system that made me sing the national anthem
While the fucking flag hanged
The same system that'll claim innocent lives
Barack ain't made shit change
Nigga fuck this shit, I won't budge!
Shit, I won't budge
They say Rosa Parks was sitting on the wrong bus
And now that Malcolm X is gone, I guess it's on us
Fuck a cop, they gon' kill us then they charge us
They gon' charge us
Pull that fucking badge out and say it's all love
But I got six warning shots to my heart, lungs, face, neck, cough blood
Now they say we all thugs
I guess we all thugs
Ever since the Watts Riots, motherfuckers wanna try us
Everything was all quiet til they crossed us
Al Sharpton keep on talking, nigga do something!
Nigga prove something
So much drama, I just got the fucking goosebumps
Word down to Ferguson, they murderin' the youth young
What the fuck is new, son
This shit gon' make me lose some'n

This a war we won't back down
Fuck this country, we ain't treated fair
I should burn the fucking flag down
Yeah, I should burn the fucking flag down
But your victims lash out, they have no clue
But if I protest, a nigga'll put me in a stretcher
Gun me down with my hands up screamin' ""DON'T SHOOT!""
Motherfucker, don't shoot!

[Verse 2]
By the system I was raised
Same system that just killed Mike Brown the other day
Same system that just slayed Sean Bell, Trayvon, Eric Garner, what a shame!
The same system that gon' lie just to cover up the crime, quick to send us to the grave
The same system that'll claim innocent lives
Barack ain't made shit change
Nigga, fuck this shit, I won't budge!
Shit, I won't budge
They say Emmitt Till whistled at the wrong slut
And now that Martin Luther gone, I guess it's on us
Fuck the cops, they gon' kill us then they charge us
They gon' charge us
Pull that fucking badge out, leave a nigga passed out
CLAP PLOW twenty shots to my heart, lungs, face, neck, cough blood
All they do is cross us
Living in the projects, and we all thugs
Now they searchin' through my pockets
Wanna treat me like a hostage
Tryna get inside my conscious like a broad does
If they catch me lookin' wrong, I'm a rebel though
If I got my hoodie on, I'm a criminal
If I got my hands up, that means I probably got a weapon
If they kill me, then I guess that means that it was an exception
[Hook]
This a war we won't back down
And tell the government to kiss my ass
I should burn the fucking flag down
Yeah, I should burn the fucking flag down
We were forced to surrender, they have no clue

Used to sell drugs but I never had weight
Livin' life fast like I never had breaks
Speakers on blast like I never had base
I never had friends, keep my enemies close
Roll the windows up if whenever we smoke
My niggas stay high they can never be low
And I lie to my bitch like I never had hoes
Never wish jail or death on a nigga
I never had tears or respect for a teller
I never did a beer till the cops come and get 'em
Even 27 years couldn't stop Mandela
But I never cooked crack
Never took slack
Run away from home and I never looked back
Broke ass nigga livin' life on the bottom
I was tryna touch a mil and put my mama in a condo
Up in Beverly Hills, maybe down south
Never been a funny nigga why start now
Dreams of a Bentley with a top drop down
Tryna take my shit, then it's po-po-pow
Never been a thug but I'm real acquainted

Look, I'm ill-matic with a street dream
I'm a independеnt one-man street team
Told my bitch keep the dishеs and the sheets clean
I keep the pot full 'cause my son can't eat steam
I'm just tryna keep my feet clean
Snitch niggas, they be tryna keep the streets clean
Why you niggas buy clothes full of cheap seams?
I'ma shoot porn for the generic delete scenes
I'ma suffer for the wrongs that I remember
Wrong address, the karma get brought to the sender
In a room full of artists, I get brought to the center
Shots to the armor sound like a fork in a blender
My money talk, but you don't want to talk to the lender
My money long, the only thing short is my temper
I drive by the showcase cartin' a fender
I'm lucky that the law never caught the offender
They tell me I learned everything the hard way, uh
If I make it to the charts it'll be a long way, yeah
Now I look up at the charts and see a entrée
Now I look up at the charts and see a parfait

Thou shall not kill, is that a real law?
'Cause I killed some of them niggas, but I wanna kill more
Or should I get a drill, or hack 'em with a steel saw?

Got a lot on my mind
Hopin' I never be goin' out of my mind
Been tryna mature without growin' out of my prime
I thought I was ready, it really wasn't my time
I know, I live in my head
I said I'd be rich and I did what I did
But I don't do this shit for me, I do this shit for my kids
I teach 'em how to go and get it when they ready to leave
Been tired of livin' up in hell when I know heaven is free
And nothin' really more important than protectin' they peace
I wanna teach 'em how to grow up and be better than me
When I was chasin' all the paper, with no second to breathe
And I tell myself to never give up and accept the defeat
And my premonitions already written indefinitely
But I never listen, I know my vision and never could see
And truthfully, I wasn't even supposed to make it this far (Ayy)
Or take it this far
I know that God got me, I'm thankin' Him for it (Yeah)
Soon as I get it, then I'll be payin' Him for it
You know you made it when all the haters support (Haters support)

And I don't really care 'bout nothin' except for keepin' my legacy
Hopin' I'll be livin' long enough to see what the end'll be
Had to take a shot for every nigga tryna get rid of me
I wish they could look inside my soul and see what they did to me
I got a fire inside me and it's seepin' within me
When I look inside the mirror, all I see is the little me
Wishin' I could break out, but I hope the evil don't hinder me

What you really want? What it really is?
'Cause I remember livin' my life with a milly fears
Over the years, I thought I had a million ideas
So I had to find peace and release nonsense
I do it for the art, not the content
All I really wanted was acceptance
Now as a man, I can vent this, fuck that, end this
Do what you love in this life, don't let hate in your life
No, don't work for a job 'til you eighty, then look back like
""Goddamn, I really done gave 'em my life""
If I save just one life with this verse, then it's worth it
If this is your future, you need to reverse it
Ain't nobody perfect
Man, fuck all that cake, it ain't worth it
Just take what you buried deep down and unearth that
I know that you heard it
The voice from within, not above, so do what you love
Ain't no way I could keep it up feelin' this feelin'
It's creepin' up, tellin' me I will not be enough
No, wasn't bein' me enough
I think I see enough of what I don't want in my life
Give a damn if it's right, it's the reason I write
Need a reason to fight 'cause I need it in sight
With these monsters in sight, it get darker than what I would like
But I know I'm alright
[Verse 3: Twista]
Ain't no way that you could never know my struggle
As a child, goin' through shit way harder than blowin' out a bubble
I would know lot of trouble before I got to the lyrical ability
The water that was flowin' out a funnel
I could channel the aggression and depression
For only a moment when I had to realize rappin' ain't it
When there wasn't no more money from a record deal
I couldn't get another one, so I was about to quit
Had to get a job
Didn't wanna be a slob, even though I would rather be spittin' bars
Then one day, somebody saw me at work and said
""Twista, why are you in here washin' cars?""
That hurt my heart
That shit tore me apart
So I prayed up to God
That if I ever got another chance at music, I won't take it for granted
I'ma dunk if I get the lob
Ran into AK from Do Or Die
He said, ""Come to the studio, I'ma put you on a song""
""Start my new gig in the mornin', but I'ma come after""
This is my chance to get back on
Thankful that I was livin' at my brother's house
But I want my own, so I'ma finna go in
I walked in the lab and the beat was by Trackster
Title of the song was ""Po Pimp""
I said, ""Ooh, snap""
I told 'em I'm about to jack
Spit it funky like I'm a mack
I'ma come off so hard on this track
It's gon' change my condition and change the way people rap
Might be broke as shit and ain't collectin' no dough from tips
But I be spittin' more game than a mouth full of poker chips
And I was glad that the world recognized how dope this is
And the prayer was effective
If you stressed and depressed, then let this calm and soak in your brain
First time that I ever played ""Po Pimp"" for somebody, I was on the way to work on the train
And I didn't quit it until the record was droppin'
But when I did it, I knew it was right
'Cause through my prayers and my faith and my words
It gets darker than what I would like, but I know I'm alright

I'm a bad motherfucker like Bruce Wayne
In a Mulsanne (Yeah)
New year, new me, this a new name (Joyner)
Put my new son name on a new chain (Woah)
Made new money, now I want new things (Woah)
And everybody lookin' at me like, ""You changed""
Bitch, you comin' for the top of the food chain
Whoever told you they don't listen to me really told a lie to y'all
I'm comin' to get the shit I need, if you think you got it all
If I don't win a Grammy, at least I'ma get to poppin' off
And hit the red carpet and creep with a fuckin' molotov
Blow that motherfucker to pieces, then make a monologue
You wanted to make it tougher for me, but as long as I'ma ball
Put these rap niggas to sleep, I don't need a Tylenol
Fuck the world, I got a reason to take the condom off
Shit is deeper than deep seas and I'm even deeper
Than the sea creatures that breathe heat that'll freeze beaches
And you couldn't see me, even in dreams with a psychic medium
And couldn't read me if they was teachin' encyclopedias
In HD, if I leave, it'll make it easier
I'm not a human, I'm half demon or ET and them
My DNA is a cheat sheet with a key ingredient
Of green bleach, I eat beats and motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of evil heatin' up inside of me (Woah)
They say I'm crazy, but I know that's how I gotta be (Hey)
I'm tired of jealous niggas tellin' me they proud of me
But really on the low, they be plottin' how to slide on me (Wow)
Got tired of livin' in the hood and seein' poverty (Joyner)
I made it flip and then invested it in property (Woah)
I bought the buildings that I grew up in beside of me
And gave 'em to my niggas, now my niggas play Monopoly (Okay)
I ain't got feelings for a ho, someone check on this bitch
Picture me cryin' 'bout a regular bitch (Yeah)
No, I ain't cocky, I been on this shit
Better open my door when I step in this bitch (Woah)
I ain't got time for no feminine shit (Woah)
Goin' back and forth on no internet shit (Woah)
Shorty run game, I'm ahead of that trick
Can't play a real nigga, I invented that shit (Grrah)
Niggas told me I should drop out of school and I graduated
Never knew I would know the shit that I knew, but I'm glad I made it
I was comfortable with breakin' the rules and infatuated
With the thoughts of gettin' up out this room and evacuatin'
Lot of shit that I had to prove and then use my imagination
I just pray that I be different than you when I'm acclimated
From the moment I was born, in the booth, I was activated
Doctor tried to pull my head out the womb then decapitate it
Now I'm on a mission to get respect and I hope you givin' it
Want every pinch of this red cent, every single Benjamin
Don't even mention it, I been cool, but I'm kinda innocent
And my adrenaline rush weapon is my specimen
And goddamn, digest and apply pressure
And I know my pen is the diabetes so my insulin
Is not Ritalin, it's me into my element
If God givin' it, I'm livin' it, motherfucker, I'm ill
[Chorus]
Can you feel the beat? Can you, can you
Can you feel the beat within my heart? (Motherfucker, I'm ill)
Can you feel the beat? Can you, can you
Can you feel the beat within my heart? (Motherfucker, I'm ill)
Can you feel the beat? Can you, can you
Can you feel the beat within my heart? (Motherfucker, I'm ill)
Can you feel the beat? Can you, can you
Can you feel the beat within my heart?

[Outro]
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part

Champagne for my real friends
Real pain for my sham friends
(Uh, uh uh uh) Nah
Champagne for everybody (Yeah)
Uh

[Verse 1]:
Champagne dreams for them days I was unemployed (uh)
Selling drugs, trying to live, I was stuck in void (yeah)
Wasn't like I wanted to
But what the fuck I'm 'posed to do
When the government ain't giving me no fucking choice?
They ain't want to show us love like them other boys
I was trying to make a change 'til they cut my voice
I was trying to buy a Range 'til they upped the price on me
Try to cut the lights on me like they clubbing boy (Boy)
I can tell ya things, that some people never seen in life
Living lavish, thinks that happiness the key to life
I had a couple bad bitches, I ain't treat 'em right
I had a couple fat bitches I ain't even like
But their conversations was enough to make me sleep at night
Never fucked 'em, but I made sure they were eating right
Only loved 'em 'cause they taught me how to love myself
Gave me something to believe when there was nothing else
Tell me something else
All I know is hell, point me to the riches
It's funny how niggas screaming, money over bitches
But, when them niggas going broke, then it's bitches over money now, oh
Whoa, that's some fake shit, but that's the world that I know
She just want attention, that's the girl that I know (yeah)
I just want a pension, that's a check that I deserve
Share it with my niggas, I ain't stressin' 'bout a bird
All you ever wanted in life was to be a legend
All I ever wanted in life was to be accepted (uh)
All I ever wanted at night was a Lamborghini
'Til I woke from my dreams, and they told me to keep dreamin'
My radio demons
Too much new shit with out a reason (yeah)
Too much music without a meaning (yeah)
But how the hell do I keep believing without achieving
And how the hell do I pledge allegiance without allegiance?
Me and John Lennon by the fire, singing songs
""Kumbaya,"" wishing that my Lord sing along
Reminiscing 'bout every nigga that did me wrong
Pray to God I don't catch 'em slipping, but this is wrong
This is wrong
We ain't supposed to hold grudges
Forgiven all my enemies for they don't know nothing
This is Sunday school church, this is soul touching
This that old Keisha Cole back in '07
This that Bob Marley dreadlock shit
This that grandma in the kitchen cooking ham hog shit, whoa!
I warned niggas years ago before they cared about me
Like ""If you don't hear me now, then you going to hear about me.""
But I forgive 'em, I can see them over there watching
And I still got champagne for everybody
Pour it
Champagne for everybody (yeah)

She said
She said ""I thought that you were different""
""I thought that you'd be different"" (you'd be different)
'I thought that you would be submissive' (nah)
Told you all my secrets while you just pretend to listen
Just so you can have a feast while you fuck me in the kitchen
Man, you cold blooded and maybe other hoes love it
But I ain't other hoes my nigga I'm so subborn
Them fucking with my heart is like touching a cold oven
That shit barely work, you 'bout to get your feelings hurt
Hold up
Close my eyes and I never get lost again
Some niggas cross the line and I never get crossed again
Pigs pulling triggers, these kids won't walk again
And that's the day I promised God that I'd never eat pork again, wait
No money, no commas, always had them problems (I wish)
More money, more problems, wish I had them problems (I wish)
I know that finance you stressing had you at the bottom but at least if you was making dollars, you can have some progress
They told me only time could tell, but I had no options
Eviction notice, I ain't had no options
Young Jeezy bumping, I was on my Tamadotchi
'Til I almost seen the ghost, I was Action Bronson
I just wanted champagne while I crack a lobster
I just wanna see your fucking hands at the concerts
I just wanna see Meghan Good without the nose job
I just wanna see Eva Mendes without the clothes on
And so long to my old kins, and my old friends
And so long to my old bitch and her hoe friends
Shout out to all them hypocritical Christians
Who act like just because I use the words 'niggas' and 'bitches' I can't deliver my message
Come deliver my blessings
Upon evil hide your sins , up in witness protection and
I warned niggas years ago before they cared about me
Like 'If you don't hear me now, then you going to hear about me.'
But I forgive 'em, I can see them over there watching
And I still got champagne for everybody
Pour it
Chapagne for everybody
There you go
[Interlude]:
Can I have everybody's attention, please?
I need to make a toast
A toast to every motherfucker that ever did me wrong
A toast to the basic hoes that played me
And the fuck niggas that slayed me
A toast to the non-believers and the money-hungry creatures who was sitting down eating steaks and lobsters, crabs and didn't even offer me a fucking biscuit with the butter that they give you at the restaurant when you sit at the table
I've been hungry since the days I was able to use music as an escape when my aunt was on Section 8 and got her first apartment
I wanna make a toast to my unborn child, I can't wait to see you smile when you come out
A toast to all my old friends who backstabbed me and spread dirt on my name
Well, I got plenty champagne for y'all
Heh, I got plenty champagne for everybody
I got champagne for everybody!

[Outro]:

You don't love me
You say you do, but I never know if you do or you don't, because
You never tell me how much
If you really loved me then, you would tell me how much
I tell you all the time, so you gonna tell me or what?

[Verse]
I love you so much there's not enough that I could say (Say)
If I put how much I love you on a scale, it'll probably break (Break)
I love you more than all the galaxies in outer space
And every single star, and every solar system out the way (Way)
I love you to the point that if I didn't have the cash
And you needed money fast, then I'd probably rob a bank (Facts)
And if there was a food that I could never eat again
Unless I had to wait for you, then I guess I gotta wait (Wait)
I love you more than every drop of water on this planet (Planet)
Includin' all the droplets in the clouds that haven't landed (Landed)
I love you more than Jack loved Rose on the Titanic
And I'll even buy a boat in case you ever wanna chance it (Chance it)
If you was trapped on an island, never seen again
Then I'd try to swim to get you even if I couldn't swim (Word)
And if I couldn't find you 'cause your destiny depends
On the day I stop breathin', then I'll never breathe again (Again)
I love you more than all the words in every single language (Yeah)
More than every letter in every book on all the pages (Uh-huh)
More than all the detail on every picture painted
Probably love you more than I love me, and that shit kinda dangerous (Word)
If you had alopecia, and your hair never grew
Then I would shave my shit bald just so I could look like you (Haha)
If you had one arm and you couldn't tie your shoes
Then I might cut off my arm just to give that shit to you (Facts)
I love you more than Wendy Williams loves tea (Tea)
Probably love you more than Adam ever loved Eve (Eve)
And if you killed someone and told me, then I'd help you hide the body
Which means I'll be an accomplice, but it must be (Be)
Clean up all the DNA then burn the evidence away
While I'm plottin' our escape right out of the country ('Try)
'Cause when I say I'm ride or die, that means I'm really by your side
Ridin' 'til I gotta die and my blood bleed (Bleed, Joyner)
I think I love you so much there's not enough that I could say (Say)
If I put how much I love you on a scale, it'll probably break (Word)
I love you more than Chrisean Rock loves Blueface (Yeah)
I love you more than the ladies love some Cool J (J)
I love you so much that I would step in front a bullet
If a nigga ever pull it, I'll be Bobby Boucher
If we was broke and homeless and my old career was over
I'll be singin' on the corner for a little loose change (Facts)
I love the fact that God took His time when He made you (Mm)
I love you as you are, I hope you don't ever change you (Change you)
I love you to the point that if I ever let you down
I probably won't forgive myself 'cause I don't know how I would face it (Yeah)
My doctor say it isn't healthy how much I praise you (Mm)
I love you so much, I pray for you when I embrace you (Yeah)
On a scale from one to ten, it's too much for me to rate you
But I love you so much I, I, I hate you (I hate you, I hate you, I hate you)

Some boi no knew nutna bout nutna
Nutna bout nutna
Nutna bout nutna

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Aye, what you know about stunting?
What you know about lame ass niggas always talking bout money?
What you know about stray bullets hitting when you never seen it coming?
What you know about Joyner Lucas all up in the streets to the flooding?
To the bass, ba-ba-ba-ba bass till you running down a motherfucking tunnel?
What you know about the cops on the corner tryna knock a nigga hustle?
What you know about Illuminati, everybody working for the devil?
Feeling dead but I'm working for the living
I be in a spaceship getting-getting-getting litted
I be Trinidad James, nigga-nigga-nigga, listen
What you know about riding?
What you know about a check even though a nigga really don't got it?
What you know about the boys at your door while you hiding in the closet?
Pray to God they don't ever catch you slipping or falling
Balling on a budget with my windows tinted
And you ain't seen nothing, nigga, you ain't seen nothing

[Bridge: Busy Signal]
What you know about money from the chop?
Hustling on the grind nonstop
In the street, but the heat make it hot
Looking out for the cops on the block
You know nothing bout slanging them rocks
Taking hits from nothing to the top
Lock it down and setting up shop
Getting all that paper and stock
See Joyner Lucas LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like[Chorus: Busy Signal]
Don't you know that I be riding solo?
Making money, staying high with pure dro
What you know about the dough that we blow?
Don't play no games, I tell these niggas lay low

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, what you know about rhythm?
What you know bout an east coast nigga with a sound so trilla?
Don't you know I'm Mike Jack, call you looking at the man in the mirror
What you know about a party? Everybody throw your hands to the ceiling
To the bass, ba-ba-ba-ba bass and you feel it in your motherfucking fingers
What you know about Picasso? I think another picture being painted
And what you know about drinking to the pain? All you do is get faded
What you know about rapping all day and you dedicate your life to a dream that ain't paying and knowing there's a big chance you could never ever make it?
That's fucked up, ain't it?
And what you know about waiting even if a nigga really impatient?
I got love for the hood even though I wish I was really in Vegas
With bad bitches in the water, I be deep sea swimming
To wake up in the car with my windows tinted
And you ain't seen nothing, nigga, you ain't seen nothing

[Bridge: Busy Signal]
What you know about money from the chop?
Hustling on the grind nonstop

What you know about pain?
What you know about living on the edge, ain't nothing gon' change?
What you know about standing on the corner, tryna hustle all day?
What you know about scraping up change so your supper get paid?
At your door, knock knock knock-knock-knock and your landlord banging for the rent
What you know about waiting for a prayer that ain't never get sent?
What you know about trusting nobody? We ain't never been friends
You ain't never shook hands with the fans
I be in the bad bitches put they ass on my hands
I be on that low soul, d-d-d-d-d-d-damn

What you know about Joyner? (what you know about him?)
Nah, what they know about Busy? (Busy, what up, my nigga!)
Dead Silence! Joyner!
You ain't know about it

10185298,Joyner Lucas,I Didn’t Go,"20 ContributorsI Didn’t Go Lyrics[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Yo
Either you play the game or the game plays you (Facts)
And if you don't get the picture, nigga, change angles (Word)
We used to be broke, now our chains dangle (Yeah)
And before the theatre in my crib, it was plain cable (Mm)
Oh, oh you lame, ain't you? (Yeah)
And if you lame, you stay lame, money can't change you
I'm a bigger artist, and I don't care if we on the same label
I'll put a baby and a Plan B in the same cradle (Grr, baow)

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Gettin' rich was my only plan (Ayy)
'Cause you can't raise my son and have an OnlyFans (Facts)
Project windows was my only fans (Yеah)
Take my mama out the hood, that was my only plan (Joyner)
I'm an ovеrthinker that over-plans
You still throwin' haymakers, praying and hope it lands
My sins gon' kill me and I know it can
Like starin' down a barrel of that nine but I hope it jams (Grr, baow)
Why do niggas hate me? I can't find an answer (Uh)
They remind of some tumors, that's a lot of cancer
Or a lot of banter
Don't know if my son'll be disappointed or surprised after he finds out I'm Santa (Yeah)
In order to live I needed to know how I could hide the tantrums (Woah)
In order to get where I needed to go, I took a lot of slander (Facts)
And took a lot of chances (Yeah)
I told wifey, ""I got rules, if you call and I'm with my ho, then I don't gotta answer"" (Baow)
You say that I ain't shit, well, you may be right (Facts)
'Cause I can sell your mama drugs after I lay the pipe
I can sell a bitch dope after I raise the price
Fuck gettin' stabbed in the back, I'd rather face the knife
And I want all the smoke, this is not haze
This that homegrown Methadone, John Blaze (Huh)
I hate when you niggas act like you not phased (Woah)
I hate when my bitches act like they not slaves (Ah)
And I'm a born sinner, but I got saved (Joyner)
Show up to the church, then I got paid (Joyner)
I'm what God made (Brr)
And fuck a durag, I had so many brushes with death, I think I got waves
Lil' roach, I think I got Raid
Pest control on 'em, they got sprayed
The day you can picture givin' cops names
The day that you can picture A$AP Rocky without braids

Picture niggas rollin', flyin', foreign floatin', outer space (Ayy)
Or bitches on Instagram with no filter face (Face)
Picture if judges ain't judge us by our race
My nigga Thugga Thugga would be free, I pray he beat his case (His case)
Picture the industry when it's missin' me
Niggas run they mouth with no insurance, can't even fix they teeth
Everybody tellin' me stay woke, but shit, I need some sleep
I'm 'bout to change my number, drop a comment if we need to speak
All you niggas who did less for me tryna get next to me
I don't trust you niggas with no money, but got expertise (Haha)
Level up or leave, pull up in them SUVs
Security is refugees, travel 'cross the seven seas
People in my pocket like I ain't got one at home to feed
Fell out with my cousin 'cause I won't spot him eleven Gs
Aunty mad 'cause I don't call as much as she be callin' me
I swear to God, sometimes I wish my family had a referee (Brr, shh)
Big dogs gotta play for keeps (Play for keeps)
I'm courtside or I'm in the suites (Facts, baby)
Some niggas said I don't support the streets (Who's that?)
He just mad that I ain't like his beats (Haha)
The insecurity's so loud
When you win, they wanna stop you, I'm guessin' that's how it go now
The album 'bout to drop, this whole year look like a rollout
They was actin' like they ain't know, but I bet they know now (I bet they know now)
[Interlude: DMX]
Grr, uh

[Verse 3: DMX]
Been through the pain, been though the struggle
Been through the rain, made it out the jungle
And I'm grateful for it all, the blessings and the curses
The triumphs and the failures, the lessons in the verses
The best and the worse is (Uh) yet to be seen (Uh)
And based on what I've been through, I don't know what that means (What?)
But whatever it's gon' be (Uh), it's gon' be good
'Cause I know God and knowin' me, it's gon' be hood (Go hard)
Let me walk you through the darkness (Darkness), walk you to the light (The light)
Walk you through the hardest (The hardest) fights of your life (Your life)
Walk you through the good times (Good times), walk you through the struggle (Struggle)
Walk with you through it all, just because I love you (Uh)
Hug you when you need me to (Hug), scold you when I have to (Yeah)
Teach you when I got to (Come on), the devil's tryna get at you (Yeah)
Try not to let him grab you (No), but even if he does
I'll be right there to help get him off just because (Just because)

[Chorus: DMX]
Before I was born, You was right there (Uh)
Even after I'm gone, You'll be right there (Uh)
And whenever it's on, You'll be right there (Come on)
I'll make it through the storm 'cause You'll be right there (What?)
Before I was born, You was right there (Uh)
Even after I'm gone, You'll be right there (Come on)
And whenever it's on, You'll be right there (What?)
I'll make it through the storm 'cause You'll be right there (Come on)
[Interlude: DMX]
In the name of Jesus
I love it, I love it, man, I thank You for it all
I thank You for it all
I thank You for my blessings
I thank You for my curses
I thank You for my problems
I thank You for my, my, my triumphs
My, all, I just thank You for it all
Everything I went through, I know it was for the grace of God
And it's gon' help somebody someday
Hello? I'm talkin' to somebody

Verse 1:
Fuck a swag or being wavy, my practice is being different

I slash his Achilles tendons

(Yo what about cars?)

Mitsubishis, Hyundais and Kias
Range Rovers, Hyundais, a Lexus

More shit I just can't afford, when I see you I'm taking yours

The streets is tattle-telling, cats revealing
Half 'em killing, half 'em dealing
Strapped and peeling
Blaaat, Kill 'em
They trap us
Send the coppers at them niggas trapped in prison
Cause these bastards tell'em, that's a bad decision

Verse 4:
They devious, beautiful, sexy
Intelligent, back-bone, sneaky
Deceitful, envy
Argumentative, territorial with lots of fetishes
Emotional creatures who like leathery baller benefits

(What about politics?)
Verse 5:
Fucking whack, the U.S. is under attack
The whole nation is under scrutiny, psychological foolery
TV is filled with coonery, guess it's cool to be that
It's a shame the reason we voted Obama is cause he's black

(Joyner)
Verse 6:
Joyner Lucas, I'm spitting shit out the air
Kicking alphabetical schemes, and I smack the shit out of words
Slam you on the street, tell them you got hit by the curb
I can take the Hit out of ler, I can take your bitch out of her

(What about food?)
Verse 7:
Fried chicken and roasted coyle, with fish smothered in oil
With onions and pass the foil
Some cabbage, candy yams
Smoked ribs and a fucking wrap, and two mikes
A female groupie and some actress as Angela Bassett
(What about your favorite rappers?)
Verse 8:
Black thought, Slim Shady, K. Lamar
Joe Budden, J. Stylez, P, Nas
Plenty more, Lauryn Hill, Mos Def
Farrahman, Kweli, Kanye
Method Man, Jay-Z, Beanie Sieg, me

(What about kids?)
Verse 9:
Innocent, rowdy plus curious
Rambunctious peer pressure
Funny ones, smart ones
Even some who lack guidance, act violent, troublesome
They need love, they need us, they need what, they need

(What about drugs?)
Verse 10:
Ecstasy, coke, 2 acid tablets
Some reefer, that's THC for my speakers
I'm PCPing, some bleach and some DVDs
I buy shrooms and some oxycotins
Some crystal meth on this beat, got you smoking crack in your seat

(Wordplay)
Verse 11:
Wordplay, play with words
Even if the words play
Tetris like a puzzle, puzzle stretching like I'm exercising
Exercising when I'm taxi driving, driving texting while im whiling texting
Til they pull me over give me breathalyzers
Tempers rising, textin bitches
Letters like I'm emphasizing, emphasizing by the size of envy put them em inside
Step aside, keep it in this verse put your friend aside
That's what I learned, never mind if ever I should tell a lie
Then tell a lie, when you see him
I've been seeing devil's eyes, eyes devil red and God told me that the devil died
Lamborghini diablo, Devil dare me to devil die
Right off the cliff, satanic strip until the genocide

I've never been a gang banger with street killas
If I protect myself, I'll be favoring all these niggas and
I bought my first gun from my homie who tried to sell it
A 9 with a couple bullets, just eyes when I'm out here looking
Trying to find a job to survive so I stop tossing
Hop inside the whip and then drive cause I walk often
Stressing like a bitch, cause I'm tired of my Mom's apartment
I'm Satan in God's office that's.. (alright hold up.)

Shovels to my gravestone, kicking dirt on my coffin
Broke bitches with their hand out, cause they heard I was balling
Fuck me so good, went to sleep, woke in the morning
Six niggas in my face, Guns drawn with no warning
Pistol whip, stomped me and left me like I was dead
I had murder on my conscience, I was plotting on revenge
Circling the block like I know what I need to do
Before I cock the fucking hammer I said what would Jesus do...

[Interlude]
Because Christ is not only leader
He was teacher
But not just leader and teacher
He was Christ the redeemer
Christ the restorer
Christ the deliverer

Hate's the only motivation, that's how real we made it
Guilty by association, you affiliated
Smoking Newports while I'm riding the Willie Mays
Watch you niggas turn bitch, there's nothing more humiliating
I wonder what my life be like, if I ain't had no hobby
Probably dancing with the Devil, moving like a Jabbawockeez
I just want change, wonder how much that'll cost me
I don't think I have a heartbeat I'm just.. (alright fuck it)

Tempest keep raging my mind, don't ever sleep
See my cousin in the cold, gave him a ride up the street
Blue flashing lights, pulled behind me it's the police
So my cousin reached in his jeans, threw the burner under my seat
They pulled us out the car, got charged with a loaded 9
Cause he told the boys it was mine, I was facing a 5-9
My Mama sold the car, bailed out in a week or two
Before I caught that nigga slipping, I said what would Jesus do...

[Interlude 2]
Not that Jesus is God
Because Jesus never told you to worship Him
He told you to follow Him
And you see, Pastor, when we praise Jesus
He's worthy to be praised, we feel good don't we
But not enough, follow Him
[Verse 3: Joyner Lucas]
Rappers on TV with jewels,  we idolize them
Picturing myself on the news and paparazzi
Bunch of grimy thoughts, niggas never had no conscience
I've been looking for a jux, being broke is not an option
I've never been violent, I'm shaking just being honest
Especially when my girl ain't working and we was starving
Argue every minute, fighting in a small apartment
She tripping just non-stop and I'm like.. (shh bitch I got to go)

Looking for some pussy to fuck just for one night
Get some anger out my chest and bust until I'm right
Met this shorty at the bar, she was working for some tips
Took me back to her crib and I was nervous as a bitch
Her husband came home and he was lurking in the crib
While I was jerking in his bitch, he grabbed the burner out the 6
Bursting in the room, cocked it back, from me to you wait
Before you pull that trigger think of what would Jesus...

Ain't no excuse and I feel like a dog

[Verse 2]
I'm para-I'm para-I'm paranoid
I must admit
Real mixed emotions that I gotta fix
When she at work I be losing my mind
Feeling like she know the truth and I'm blind
Taking my time, I got a plan (I got a plan)
Plus I'm afraid that she won't understand
If she found out then I'd be on my own
Fighting these urges to cheat on the low
No, it ain't real (No, it ain't)
No, it ain't cool
No, I ain't saying that this is the move (This is the move)
But it was only supposed to be once ('Posed to be once)
But that one night just turned into a few
I'm such a dick
Feel like a cheat
Wonder how'd I feel like if that was me (If that was me)
Knowing they fearing, I know that it's wrong
Ain't no excuse though I feel like a dog

I've been so selfish, I've been so blind
I feel so stupid, I don't know why
I got a good girl at home
And I know she love me so much

8218637,Joyner Lucas,What If I Was Gay? (Alternate Version),"14 ContributorsWhat If I Was Gay? (Alternate Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Uh
What if I told you that I was different?
What if I told you that something's missin'?
And what if I told you we're not alike
And the way that I feel inside is different than what you picture
What if I told you I feel divided?
Keep to myself and I'm awfully quiet
And what if I told you I been conflicted by my own thoughts
Trapped in the dark, and I tried to hide it
No, I'm not a slave to no fuckin' fairy tale
I bet you think that you know me very well
Make no mistake, this is not a cry for help
'Cause I don't owe no one no explanation on how I feel

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
But on the real, what if I told you that I was brave?
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?

Yeah
What if I told you I'm not alright?
I mean, I don't feel dеad, but I'm not alive
And what if I told you, ""I'm not like you""
And the shit I'vе been goin' through, it'll prolly make you cry
And what if I told you, ""I'm not this""
And the person you think you know don't exist
Look, I'm not who you know, I'm not who you wish
I'm not who you want me to be, what you want from me isn't this
I grew up in church where I couldn't be myself
I felt like a prisoner, couldn't leave my cell
They told me, ""God don't like ugly,"" and this an ugly world
And if I ever seen things different, then I would burn in hell

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
And on the real, this is not new, this is not a phase
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?

[Verse 3: Eminem]
What if I told you I'm homophobic?
And you have zero control over your impulses
And the genetic flaw in your chromosomes is the culprit
It's somethin' I can't sugarcoat, it's repulsive
We were homies, since children, I thought it
But thought I was buggin', though
'Cause we'd sit, chill and just talk chicks
Now how can we be friends still on the block
When skin pigment is not our biggest difference, it's awkward
Don't think it's somethin' I can't deal with
Think I'm 'onna vomit, I'm gettin' this sick feelin', I'm nauseous
Part of me wishes you'd kept this shit, still in the closet
I'm white, but this is givin' me mixed feelings, like Logic
I remember kids stealin' your big wheel and callin' you sissy
'Cause you wouldn't do shit really to stop it
And now it all makes sense
Is this the end of our friendship?
It's startin' to send chills through my body
Yeah, I'm pissed off a little, this is a choice
We were s'posed to be boys
You're actin' like this ain't optional
What if I said you was weak?
'Cause you don't got the strength to conquer some biological monster that's part of you
That's responsible for them homosexual thoughts
If you don't want a lecture, part
Like a sofa section or long as you
Make your decision and stand by it, but I can't be beside it
'Cause for me, that'd be next to impossible
Or you learn to control your urges
You say, ""It's like pullin' teeth and morals are oral surgeons""
But how would you even know anyways if you're a virgin
Why can't you be a normal person?
What if I tried steerin' you towards a girlfriend?
Wouldn't work, would it? You seem pretty surefooted
I'm sure good at judgin', but I have no right
I know goodbye seems cold, right?
Not even a flicker of hope like a strobe light
As I leave and I swear I stayed up that whole night
And no, I didn't know you would go right home and go take your own life
I ain't mean for that shit to happen, I said I won't cry (shit)
Fast forward, some years go by
My girl's pregnant with twins, boy and girl
Fast forward again, they just turned seven
I wish I had a crystal ball, 'cause now I sit in awe
Just caught my son in a brawl
Playing with his sister's dolls with lipstick on

One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore (Woah)
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad (Woo)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to—

[Verse 1: Starringo]
Ayy, when I step in the booth, yeah, that's another hit (Outta here)
Perfect attendance, they know I never miss (Yeah)
I'm goin' body for body, I got the evidence
The way they callin' me the G.O.A.T., I changed it to my government
Been killin' rappers since I was a jit', I fell in love with it
You put 'em on a track, I chew them niggas like some Dover men
Louisiana savage, you can tell the way I'm thuggin' it
Would never, I can sense this goin' down, you know I'm uppin' it, I'm tellin' you
Ayy, big dawg status, they like, ""Who done let the dog in?""
If I say we comin', you gon' have to let us all in
Treat it like the season after summer, I just fall in
Had to go to work for this verse, I'ma call in
Put 'em in the dirt, it get worse, I go all in
ATM swipe, it disperse, now I'm ballin'
Gotta be first, you know me, ain't no stallin'
I'ma get to it, no weak, no pausin'
They say they slidin', but we Tokyo driftin'
I had to step on a couple rappers to get my position (Yeah)
Ain't really wanna do it to 'em but I made it a mission
I'm like a shelf with the dishes, I put myself in the kitchen
I push start just to start the ignition
I touch hearts, this should be an emission to see me flow like this
I put the pedal to the flo' like this
And take off, rims off, said they no chain, no Quavo
Rappin' like I'm outta my mind
You know they vouchin' for the kid, 'cause I'm top of the line
They put them bars in a row and I'm not in a line
You know a different type of kind
This a matter of time 'fore they see that
Takin' shots at my peep at grocery stores
Make me wanna flash out and take a soul (Rah)
Put 'em on ice like Isis, Lord knows
But if I steal a candy bar, open doors (Rah)

Una vez para los que me dudaron (Ah)
Dos veces para los que me juraron (Woo)
Tres para las que cuernos me pegaron
Cuatro para las que amaba, estando bajo me dejaron
Cinco veces para los que traicionaron (Yeah)
Seis pa' los que de mí se aprovecharon (Ah)
Siete, ocho, nueve, diez
Don't care for your penitence
You can go to hell with your right hand on the Bible
It's all about survival, killed it on arrival
Killin' all my rivals, me levanto si me caigo
No creo que haiga campo para todo lo que traigo
No hallan donde esconderse si se mete como un psycho
Circulo vicioso, but you gotta break the cycle
You can never melt these bars, I can't be recycled
Llego y dicen, ""Ay, no"", listenin' and I know
Tryna read what I wrote, this is not a typo (Ah)
They gon' learn, a las buenas, a las malas
Le meto duro cuando me entra las ganas
Solo es la punta y salen embarazadas
I dealt my hand after I dealt with the problems
Whoever want 'em, you can tell 'em I got em
Spot 'em, drop 'em, stomp 'em, dale, vale, madre
Jaque mate y sale, padre, arre, arre
El que me debe que lo pague en sangre
Y más le vale not to opt in violence
O que en paz descanse! (Ah)

[Verse 3: Lex Bratcher]
I'm puttin' you through imminent pain, and I don't give a fuck
Spittin' only rhythm and flame, and I don't get enough credit
Let it into my veins so I can feel the stuff that warrants me
To enter your brain, I'm talkin' eminent domain
I'm killin' Isis with the fight shit
Any nigga that might diss, so divisive
Flow cold so when I spit, it is ice chips
So dark in my mind, someone hit the light switch
I don't fuck with sexism, defendin' all my chicks
(He copy me), he goin' through an identity crisis
(I'm in the ring), you don't want none of this mouth, I am Tyson
But the funny thing is these other niggas out here bitin'
I'm gonna make it, I'm psychic
I keep murderin' every beat, I'm leavin' 'em all lifeless
I got more drive than a teen tryna get his license
So many naked queens runnin' 'round me, call 'em Titans
I be high as fuck so much that I'm a flight risk
I got you on my scope, I promise it's on sight shit
She excited, she lookin' at me dead in my iris
I make her super wet, then I suck her dry like a Dyson
Tryin' to sell my hits but all my rhymes is priceless
Small percentage makes it, I'ma be in a tight fit
Tired of bein' broke, I've come to term with my vices
Here on out, I am winnin', I'm superb and decisive
Get it? I'm super indecisive
I don't know how I'm evil when my flow is the nicest
Oh, and I sense these hoes I might fight with
When I do a show, you know I sign the fine print
Know my style's vibrant, I'm colorful
It seems, though, I'm a seagull, but, see, you're just gullible
None of you add value to me, you're all nullable
My DNA is coded to be more than all you other hoes
I just want the Porsche, I can't afford it, but I'm comin' close
Ready for the orbit, you can show me on the Hubble, yo
She wants me to come, so if we're going then be subtle, though
I control the order so my homies gotta huddle, bro, no
[Verse 4: Kvng Moses]
When I said I wasn't fuckin' with you, I meant that (No cap, nigga)
I was seventeen, everyone thought my shit's trash
Everybody side-eyed on the sidelines while I'd write lines at gym class
Bitch-ass, hopin' a nigga did bad (No)
The tables turned, but I been that nigga
Make 'em—(Tss), when I rip it like a skin tag, nigga
Takin' care of five kids, I needed quick cash, in fact
If you fuck with them, you gettin' slapped like Chris ass (Ha)
Niggas see I'm hot, but you ain't cool with me now
Bitches see I'm gettin' money, thoughts of usin' me
Curly hair with the jewelry, now they bumpin' my music
When truth be told they didn't fool with me
Really watchin' with scrutiny (Wow)
Nigga, don't give me dap, and a handshake
When, in past days you wanted smoke like an ashtray
Bad days, really tryna rap with no fanbase
Now the flow nasty like a pack of fuckin' mayonnaise (Ugh)
And I got 'em listenin', maybe Dad would be proud of my vision
If he found out I'm gifted, that hungry stomach sound like an engine
He'd be only interested in seein' how much I'm gettin'
To see if I'ma give him out a percentage (Fuck outta here, nigga)
I don't give two fucks, hope you heard of me
College Station, nigga, leave yo' ass needin' surgery (Brrah)
Attitude been bad and it's worsenin'
If I ever give an explanation, it's a courtesy (Family lookin')
Family lookin' at me like I'm crazy or somethin'
(Let me hold some, cuh'), yo, what the fuck you talkin' about?
Tryna get that kind of cash where you get lost tryna count it
Neighbourhood worse than ISIS, I ain't walkin' without it
Joyner, these other niggas don't seem focused
They think they sick, but I breed COVID
They want the change like they been homeless
I am him, bitch, I'm Kvng Moses
And I've risen like the streets told it, nigga, haha (Streets told it, nigga)

Too many times I told these niggas stop playin' with me, go play with your kids
I don't wanna hear no opinions from people who still got dreams of makin' it big
I don't really care about what you would do if you had this bread or the things you would get
If you was me, you wouldn't work this hard, you don't know how long I been waitin' on this

[Verse 1]
I'm way too busy to hate on a bitch
Who bank account look like she bankin' on tips
I came up from nothin', way layin' on bricks
Been sleepin' in bandos and payin' no rent
Everyone loves you when fame don't exist
When I made a million, they say that I switched
My watch is too pricey, my chain is on lit
My diamonds are icy, I'm skatin' on this
Skatin' like Gretzky back in the '80s
I'm runnin' from 12, but that isn't Brady
You niggas is jel', but that doesn't faze me
I keep to myself if that's what it takes me (Joyner)
Thе day that you bastards'll play me
Will be the samе day me and Jennifer Lopez announce that we gon' be havin' a baby
I'm havin' some twins, there's two in the back
You want the fame, but you wouldn't last
The difference between me and you is you trash
I'm really a hunnid, you doin' too bad
Uh (A hunnid), look
If I'm at a ten, then you like a two
If you was a ten, then I'd be two hunnid
Divided by two, I'm too good at math, look
They got me started, I'm back on my shit again
She got a fatty, I thought about hittin' it
Hit it for practise like I been auditionin'

And this type of livin' is not for beginners
You kind of losers do not make decisions
Tried to be cool, but I'm not for the business

I keep the shooters like rock, paper, scissors
I made the choice, it was not they decision
I'm not gonna listen to rappers who sound like broke records
But no, you did not make the Guinness, I'm highly offended
Only way you niggas gonna get to where you want but you gotta be a gimmick
And even if you made it to the bottom of the pit
And try to climb up to the top, you know I'll prolly be a minute
Niggas always wonder how I'm feelin' and I tell 'em that I feel like I done played the fuckin' lottery and hit it
And if a bitch want me, she gotta be a ten
And if she sendin' me selfies, they gotta be explicit (Joyner)

I swerve to the right, a word of advice, don't ever pretend to be somethin' you're not
And I'm always gon' be around whether you love me or not, bitch

And I don't need no intro for you niggas, put my beat on (Yeah)
Take them bullshit rappers out your playlist and put me on (Yeah)
This the type of shit to blow the speakers out your Nissan (Uh)
Not right now, I'm busy, ho, don't call me, I'm on Piedmont (Brr)
Just hit me when the D gone (Uh)
Man, the block is hot, this ain't no street for you to speed on (Brr)
Ever since a youngin, always knew one day I'd be on (Be on)
Sick and tired of strugglin', I knew this ain't where I belong (Joyner, Joyner)

[Verse 2]
This ain't where I belong (Uh)
I go TLC all in your bitch and get my creep on (Mm)
Watch your fucking tone, I'm not the one for you to speak on (Uh)
I got on Céline, you rockin' Celine Dion
That's the shit you be on
I just turned your bird into a ex, I feel like Elon
She ain't buy my album, tell that ho to get her stream on
If the Celtics playin', shut the fuck up when my team on
Joyner's not the one to scheme on
I pull out this chopper, blow some shots until your knee gone
We don't like your music, rather listen to some emo (Emo)
Niggas treat your mixtape like some shit to roll some weed on
I ain't featurin' on your shit, you better dream on (Yeah)
""Not right now, I'm busy,"" what I tell them when they keep on (Uh)
This the type of shit to blow the speakers out your Neon (Uh)
Take them bullshit rappers out your playlist and put me on

Here’s a little shit I like to call

Rip apart the apartment
Kill your father and start with that
Nigga’s noggin’, and I'ma just ahh
Leave it at that, i believe in that rap
In the evening i trap, I’ma keep on leavin'
Cheese for that rat
In the evenin’ I 'm back you bleedin'
Rest in peace with that strap
I’m anemic but eat with the demons
Tellin' jesus I'm back!
Y'all niggas are fucked up
Approach y'all niggas like what’s up?
All my life been broke trynna' get
That dough, lookin' for my come up
And i never seen no chain, no watch
No ring, no bling, no pop up
You ain’t never sold no cain, no coke no pills
No shut the fuck up!
Kinda whip is you riding
What kind of niggas you hiding?
Faggot niggas, you braggin’, listen
What kind of dick is you riding?
Ain’t no competition, i’m popin' fuck

And inside the kitchen with choppers
I'm cursing like a mah’fucker, mah’fuckin’ chillin'
Yeah, i can make your mother fuck me and  go
Fuck her feelings!
I play the power ball, i hope i hit a
Couple of million, just so i can fuck them bitches

My nigga, what you holding? fuck that!
Nigga, that give me them hub caps
That’s more power than  MJ dancin' in Thriller with a blunt like puff that!, killin' the block with a chilla that pop
And I woulda life  prrra prrida tha prapra
Sound of the Glock, like jack in the box
To the match and the Glock, now run fast
I don’t know what you talkin’ bout
Been that nigga that knock him out
Stomp that nigga, i stomp him out
Walk that nigga, now walk him out
Flow like venom in the cold
I’m entering the zone where hoes ain’t friends
With the hoes, and a man get the most shit
From the police and they beat them cops
Pretending to hold that 5-0-8
Walk on water, and drive on lakes
Fly them clouds, i float on bliss, my home
I’m pulling it out you face

I wash my dick in a pool with some Dove soap
So tell them rappers who want to battle me fuck no (Fuck no)
I was born and raised in a pool of AIDS with a cutthroat
And now I'm bruised and pained and losing veins till my nuts blow
I'm not a fan of the blunt
I tried to smoke I was damaged for months (True)
Carry hammers like I'm starving bitch hand me your lunch (Give me it all)
Better answer me when I'm talking you hear me or what? (Huh?)
Do you understand me or what? (Answer me)
I wanna hire a hit man to kill rappers for fun
Half now to do the job and the other half with his gun (Nigga)
At high school you was the man always yapping your gums
Now we look at you like 'damn fuck happened to son?' (Fuck happened to him?)
I'm bad for your son and your daughter's mama (Yeah)
Before I die I need a hard recliner
Two lesbian dikes with soft vaginas and brains as smart as China
I'm kind of a misfit I don't hide all my business (Nah)
And I'm probably going to hell since i told God my religion
Is really no competition (Nope)
I deserve to best, only reason I'm not on top is cause they ain't heard of me yet (True)
I get it then go I'm putting you niggas in holes it's surgery rest
And get ready to blow I’m better the level the most I murder these steps
And emergency jets on my third light year

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Drinkin' all night, I'm faded (Yeah)
Starin' at pictures, anxious (Yeah)
Prayin' one day, we go back to before we became
Some distant strangers (Yeah)
But now we on different pages (Uh)
I heard you just switched locations
Swear that I hope you just don't hate me
Hit me back when you get this message
Hit me back when you get this message (Yeah)
It's been too long
Prolly moved on, but I really got a million questions (Woah)
Promise I don't got no ill intentions
Tell me what I gotta do to feel your presence (Yeah)
I miss your vibe
I know we lost time, but I'm hopin' you ain't disconnected
Maybe you can give me just a second
Thankful I can really even get this blessin', mm
And I been tryna find a way to get inside of your thoughts
I wonder if you ever think about me at all
I think you like it better when I'm not as involved
But tryna keep myself together without droppin' the ball
Funny how the world really gotta evolve
Unless you want a life with me, I don't want it at all

I'm like, let me explain (Let me explain)
But I must speak first
Lot of shit done really cut me, hurt
Couldn't love you 'til I loved me first
Had to learn that love means work (Work)
And my heart will deliver that
Hopin' even though I lost you, I get it back
If it's comin' with a cost, could I live with that?
I'd get with that
Maybe we can talk
Maybe you can come through now
Maybe we can do a little one-two now
Maybe you can let a nigga love you down
When I lost you, I lost your friendship too
So ready, I'ma trust you now
You all that I got, so if I don't got you
Tell me who am I supposed to run to now? Huh

[Chorus: Xscape, Tamika & Joyner Lucas]
Who can I run to (Who can I run to?)
To share this empty space? (Tell me)
Who can I run to
When I need love? (Oh, oh)
Who can I run to (Who can I run to?)
To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to
When I need love? (Look)
[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
Where you been at now?
Tryna figure out where your head at now
Everything I did, I regret that now
They say true love you gon' find just once
If you find its touch, don't step back now
I told them other girls, they can sit back down
I love the way you look when you in that gown
I mean that too
'Cause you the one-of-one and I believe that's you
I never met nobody that can be that cool
I know you see me lookin', I can see that view
And everything I say, you can believe that's true
I never knew that when I fucked up I would be that fool
How could I be that cruel?
Shouldn't be eatin' at me, I wanna eat at you
And if you put your legs open, I'ma eat that too

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
I'm like, let me explain (Let me explain)
But I must speak first
Lot of shit done really cut me, hurt
Couldn't love you 'til I loved me first
Never knew that love means work (Work)
Had to learn that the hard way
Tired of runnin' every time we have a hard day
Had to learn that I was lovin' you the wrong way
Can you call me?
Or could you unblock me?
Or maybe you could come through now
Maybe we can do a little one-two now
Maybe you can let a nigga love you down (Yeah)
When I lost you, I lost your friendship too
So ready, I'ma trust you now
You're all that I got, so if I don't got you
Tell me who am I supposed to run to now? Huh
[Chorus: Xscape & Tamika]
Who can I run to (Who can I run to?)
To share this empty space? (Tell me)
Who can I run to
When I need love? (Oh, oh)
Who can I run to (Who can I run to?)
To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to

Who got the plug?
Promised my auntie I'd never sell drugs
She told me pray if I ever need guidance
The truth was my logic, I never got love
Workin' my ass off to see where it get me
I need some white girl, I need me some Becky
Packets of money, I bet that they'll love me
Cause none of my honeys don't even respect me
Who got the yayo? Show me them niggas
Bitch, I've been rapping since HOV was a dealer
There's too many rappers that no one can hear 'em
And Diddy and Yeezy don't notice a nigga
Don't notice a nigga, tell me who next
Who got that Yayo? Who got that best?
Grandma gon' kill me she find that I'm dealin'
But my time is limited who got the stretch?

Pray on a downfall I hope I fall down
Then they all keep just smilin' then there go my rep

Might need a lot of them kilos
I might need a pound just for me doe
Cause I just be stressin'
I got some problems I'm guessin
I'm crazy you probably think different
I'm high on a mission
Tomorrow ain't promised
So this is just me whippin' pies in the kitchen
The pastor keep preachin' I think keep singing that gospel
Then I look straight through the bible
All of my teachers said rappin' is easy
But being successful is harder than I knew
And I would just nod I said, ""Well I'm gonna try""
She looked back at me and stared, ""Do what you can""
I said, ""Well what if I fail?"" She said, ""Just do it again""
Do what you fail, don't let the devil inside you
Don't let the ghetto deprive you
Pray everyday, but if you lose all of your faith
Then you must do what you got to
Then you must do what you got to
My nigga got get it, go take it go make it you business
Cause haters don't listen, now who got the flavor
I'm missing, now who got the flavor said

Couple shots to the kamikaze (tank)
We can get to cookin' like some hot hibachi (hot hibachi)
My Spanish bitch, she give me sloppy-toppy (bang)

Uh, put the cause on the totem, put the balls on the boat
And hit 'em all with the motive (with the motive)

And the blogs want to post a niggas songs and you notice (and you notice)
I'm a star, undervoted
I'm a dog, I'm a Doberman pinscher, you a pony
You a unicorn, Louis Vuitton, sneakers on woadie
Trying to be up on me and my niggas like you know me
You don't me
You just know what the people wanna tell ya (yeah)
Talkin' on the low, but the speakers gonna kill ya
Sleepin' on my back with the TV on the ceilin'
Got Jeezy on, chillin' with the kiwi hard sippin'
E'erybody wanna live like Tony Montana (Tony Montana)
Sniffin' out the coke with the homie, don-da-da

Beat the pussy up like a drummer boy
Thought you ran the city, what the fuck you niggas runnin' for?
Fuck the law
Tell the politician I'm a terrorist (terrorist)
And tell the government that I'm a colored kid
Tryna make a penny off of half a G
And that'll be the day you catch me workin' at a god damn Applebee's
Nigga, don't be dappin' me (dappin' me)
'Cause we ain't got shit to talk about unless you talkin' 'bout a salary (salary)
And rappers wanna talk about battle me
But they can suck my dick with a mouth full of cavities
Oh, you in trouble (trouble)
And I love it how they hate you (how they hate you)
But they actin' like they love you
Then they kiss you, then they hug you (then they kiss you)
Make a screwed face at you (uh-huh)
Middle finger saying ""Fuck you, nigga""
That's just motivation (motivation)
I ain't hatin' like a sucker (uh-huh)

Uppercut you 'til you crumble (uh-huh)
Have you singin' like Usher (like Usher)
You a dish to my supper
Motherfuck a nigga, uh
[Verse 2]
Never ever have I ever
Ever seen another motherfucker fuck her
Fuck her better, better than him
If I ever did
Then I was never ever on this planet
But I plan to dead him and forget him
If I ever seen another
'Nother different mother fucker
On a level of a level one
Level headed rapper
That be rappin' circles
'Round the circles that you rappers burnin'
Burnin' rappers like I'm burnin'
Burnin' bridges with the niggas
That be burnin' bitches
On a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction (jurisdiction)
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction

[Verse 3]
I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
The judge told me I don't listen
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Run and tell the competition
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction

I said, I'm on a murder mission

Regarded as mercilessly destructive and unstoppable
Something that demands blind devotion

What are you willing to sacrifice?
To censor the word is ground

10185299,Joyner Lucas,Three Little Pigs,"9 ContributorsThree Little Pigs Lyrics[Intro]
You know you supposed to be sleep, right?
And you gettin' too old for these bedtime stories too
But aight, I'ma read you a story
But you gotta make a deal with me though
After I read you this, you goin' to bed
That's the deal, alright
So this story right here is called ""The Three Little Pigs""

[Verse]
So there were three little pigs, they was all grown up
And they were drinkin' some hot coffee, and eatin' donuts
It was a beautiful sunny day, some real perfect weather
And the pigs was dressed the same 'cause they all worked together
And their job ain't really easy, and they work is kinda scary
So they all got water guns, that's they favorite thing to carry
And they'll squirt you more than once if they think it's necessary
But we'll talk about that later, let's get back to the story
Deep inside the forest was a family of wolves in a pack
Even though they had sharp teeth and they were black
Ain't really mean that they'll attack, just means that they were trapped
Because the color of they fur made some believe that they was bad, now
I know that sounds sad, but ain't nodody care 'cause
The problem with the wolves is they were never treated fair and
No matter where they go, only one thing is clear
That as long as you're a wolf, the pigs gon' be scared so
The forest and the town were separated
And if the wolves wanted to come around, they hesitated
'Cause they knew they wasn't welcome there, so every they roamed
They always said a prayer in hopes that they could make it home
The night was gettin' cold and all the food was runnin' low
And then right here is a picture of some pots on the stove
Some empty cabinets, some old bread with the mold (Let me flip the page real quick)
Then one of the wolves said they gon' drive up to the store
And so he hopped inside his car, and before he cranked the key
He put his seatbelt on and buckled up to be as safe can be
Followed every traffic rule on the way from A to Z
And then he went to— man, let me— let me skip to the good part
So after he bought some groceries and he was done for good
And he put the food inside his trunk as fast as he could
Then he started drivin' perfectly and headed towards the woods
Until he seen the pigs' car and knew this probably wasn't good
The pigs on the prowl
Started speedin' up and yellin' loud, ""Pull over right now
Turn the car off and throw the keys on the ground
And step out, and get on your knees and don't even make a sound""
The wolf said, ""Wow"" (Wow), ""how is this allowed?
I got my license, registration, why you tryna take me down?""
And he was real scared 'cause he knew what the pigs about
So he refused to get out and started speedin' to his house
Then he pulled up, hopped out, almost fell down
But ran inside the front door, that's when he locked the pigs out
Then the pigs screamed loud, ""Get up out this house now
Or I'ma huff, I'm puff, I'ma blow this house down"" (Down)
And now they got the house surrounded
Pointin' all their water guns, 'bout to shoot some water rounds
Kicked the door down and all they heard was water sounds
That's what happens when the pigs fear you
So here's the moral of the story with a clear view
No matter who you with or where you're at, or where to
There's always gon' be three little pigs livin' near you

And, uh
By this time you get this video, it might be too late
I did something really, really bad, man
I killed somebody tonight, yeah
I did
And I don't know if I shoulda did it, but
I felt like it was necessary, nah mean?
The person who I killed was the old me (The old me)
Yeah, see
I realized that everything I ever thought I knew about myself was wrong
And I realized that I had to sacrifice who I was
For who I wanna become (Wanna become)
And I when I say, ""Not now, I'm busy""
That means I was too busy to face myself (Face myself)
And too busy to face the truth
And the truth is (Truth is)
The old me got tooken advantage of
The old me got fucked over
The old me got beat down
The old me got shit on and spitted on and lied to
And even though I tried to forgive
And force myself to live with the hurt that I hide behind a smile
While the water overflows as I hold my breath
And block my nose in hopes that I do not drown
And in that moment, I realized that I was lost and couldn't be found
And I needed to heal, I just didn't know how
So I grabbed that gun and did what had to be done
'Cause I couldn't hide, I couldn't run
I just had to die and every drop of blood
Was for every tear that I ever bottled up, now it's a flood
So fuck who you thought I was, you piece of shit
The old me says please forgive, but new me says eat a dick
The old me was supposed to give, the new me don't owe you shit
The old me just don't exist, so fuck you, you—

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you got me all the way fucked up (me all the way fucked up)
Cause I ain't your average dude, no average you
Been playing games, ain't have no rules
Got bitches all on my nuts (niggas swinging and shit)
And I thought about marriage too, ain't have a clue you was fuckin' around with them ratchet dudes
Must think that I'm on drugs (you must think I'm great)
Shit, you must think I'm intoxicated or probably faded off liquor, weed or things I be taking
Just wasn't good enough (oh, I ain't good enough now, huh?)
And I heard your conversations from all the way in the room when you thought I was sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't give a fuck, ain't no way, no how
I got plenty bitches, plenty hoes that want me now
I got liquor in my cup, music on so loud
Every time I hear you talking, imma cut you off and I just wanna

[Chorus]
I just wanna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over

I like this feeling
Yo Q turn me up just a little bit
Yeah, just a little bit
Alright I'm ready let's go

[Verse 1]
I got 'em bitching, I'm focused
Back and forth from coast and I backstroke and I'm floating
All up in your bitch ocean, I don't think this should be insulting
Drink the juice from my glow stick, don't call me back i'm groaning
But thanks for buying my posters, I fucked around and get twisted
Strait Tequila gon' burn and I write 16's and murder that sick shit
Waiting for my turn, I'm doing this shit since I was an infant
Way before I had sperm, yeah that's the definition of an addiction
Fuck these niggas gonna learn
And I got this bad bitch she a brain buster, I don't care if Lil' Wayne fucked her, I beat her down and get brains from her then kick her out cos I can't trust her
Fuck the Benz mother fuck can't drive, and fuck the party I'm staying in, but when I get rich you'll see me whippin' it'll probably be something Bruce Wayne was in
It'll probably be something that Jay Z in
It'll probably be something Kanye be in
King size bed in the back seat, something that I can make a baby in
Wait hold up, hold up, hold up
Way too much kool aid in your heart valves
If I was you then I'd die now, jump out the window like Ron Brown

No Gucci but I'm so fly
When I walk by it's in slow mo
Shorty want me we both know
She can swallow my mojo
Don't call me back, I'm gross though
But that's the [?]
I fuck around and get wasted
They don't like me then what a shame
Take a number then wait in line
There's a million niggas who feel the same
Disappear like black magic
Black coupe to get a black wagon
Black driver with a black mask
And a black pistol for your black ass
So fuck a blunt, I'm high off life
Piss me off, that's not alright
Yeah that's that shit I don't like
Bitch hurry up, we don't got all night
508 and that's where I'm from and my shows startin', they ready for me
Profound in my hometown, it's like Motown bitch I'm Berry Gordy
Broke nigga, no tour jet
Big dreams of a Corvette

You know you keep me in a good mood and you don’t even get mad when im out of place
I love you like a fat killer ok
And thats what 50 said and even if im down to my last 50 cent then baby its all yours
You love it when I get a aggressive like a small forward
I tell you I tell you how much I need to see you
You make a nigga wanna make a pledge allegiance to you
And if you ever home alone don’t be scared to call
Wish I could plant you and grow a whole field of yall
And I know ya mama think im crazy (uh huh)
But I think that maybe if she got to know me she would wanna date me
That's just a joke

Sometimes walking away is the most constructive thing you can do
Because you are showing them the consequences of their behavior
And if they actually want to interact with you
Then they will have to change to be more compatible with your frequency in order to get you back in their reality
So sometimes the most positive thing you can do is to disconnect from someone who is of an incomparable vibration to you
Does that make sense to You?
But that may be the last resort
You may have to do that and recognize it as the most compassionate thing that you can actually do because you are showing them what the consequences of their behavior is on you
However
You always have the opportunity to reflect to someone what you believe their vibration is doing
Most people in that sense who are
Projecting on others are simply projecting their own fears about themselves on to others a fear of lack of power or lack of connection lack of belonging lack of self  worth and are projecting it onto others to distract them selves from having to look at that belief within in their own being

Riding with the riders, with the mileage on the pilot
Couple bottles and some models and some condoms we be wildin'
Choppers in the closet, for the watchers who be plottin'
Watch me burn this shit down, like Sodom and Gomorrah
My mama and father had some problems but regardless
It was obvious, I would be a fucking monster and a goblin
Killers move in silence but gorillas move with violence
And my niggas move with choppers, and maracas, and Obama’s
And the time here, llamas and the Tommy guns
Tomorrow never promised but I'm promising your time is up
Line em' up, eeny, meeny, miny, grab a shotty, everybody's fucked
Heard your bitch a hottie but she proudly, will not prolly fuck
Stomping out you soul until body jump, copy cut
Semicolon, space, point, comma, what? I'm a nut
Wave strong enough to fucking stop a truck
Smack you with a hockey puck, rip your fucking pockets off your Hollister

[Chorus]
Climbing through your windows with a hollow pipe, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ninja blades, twin razors and an army knife, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ski mask rubber gloves, cutting all the lights, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Vest on, suited up like an armored knight, I can't wait for tomorrow night

[Interlude]
Yo, I try and, I try and tell these niggas man
They not, they not fucking with me man, I, you know what I mean?
I've been doing this shit since I was like 9, 10, you know what I mean?

[Verse 1]
""Nigga you just like your father
I knew I shouldn't have kept you
Son told me not to have you, little bastard I regret you
You so disrespectful
Your daddy wore a condom and it broke
You shouldn't even be born, you wasn't meant to""
""Oh bitch I can't believe you
You never was my mom, bitch you always did me wrong
We could never get along
So many times I tried and plenty times I cried
You were never by my side, shit you never did me right""
""Motherfucker damn right
Your daddy never loved me
Used to beat me and he left me for some hefter in the country
And you a spitting image of that piece of shit faggot
If you think I treat you bad, muhfucka just imagine
I used to write poetry, he took away my passion
If you don't believe me ask him""
""But that was way back when""

Bitch, I'm a half-black assassin

Better grab your gats and blast them
Ain't none of y'all bastards have hands
Ain't none of y'all cats are scratching
And y'all move like Action Jackson
And I'm more like Captain Savage
With no black on black on madness
Bitch, y'all back on crack like crackheads
With no platinum plaques or passion
But, nigga, fuck all that, I'm a pilot
High up all over your conscience
And drive up all over your 'partments
And pile up all over your closet
I wind up all over your side bitch
Time's up, could've been in that clock
With my luck, I'll never be on that hot list
And I never had love for no dry snitch
Okay, I grew up in the projects
You come around and everyone in your pockets
You never gonna really know who they watching
Take everything and they gon' leave with your wallet

3086611,Joyner Lucas,Empty Bottles,"8 ContributorsEmpty Bottles LyricsI pray for the day I get straight
No cash still niggas trynna eat off my plate
Lord, so sorry for the things that I say, didn't know things 'd turn out this way
All alone in this world so I made mistakes. Fuck, I messed up, I tried my best
I admire my best cause they say the best things come straight from the chest
Almost caught a bullet went straight through my chest
So thankful vest and thank to the chick who played me and made me realize I ain't shit
Just a nigga trynna make it and if I ain't got it, imma take it, if you got it imma chase it
Imma robber in the making, but my head keep ringin'. Heh
Somebody talkin' about me again probably just another nigga trynna out me again
Probably just a hater that just won't allow me to win
Got me sippin' on this bottle of gin, thinkin' bout my role model again
But what would my nana think if I was following him?
Staring at these twin hollows again damn
What a nigga gotta do to make life worth livin'?
Is worth life livin',  I ain't like most niggas Iont think that
Me and you cool, I mean we used to back when you was you and I'm still the same

A lot of people change, with a whole lot to lose and a whole lot to gain that's just game, that's just the game
We all gonna break, I stay rollin' up, I hate growin' up
But wait hold it up, damn look at yo smile, I love it when you smile
Yeah, I love it when you smile, it reminds me of a child
It remind me of a child, it remind of the belt and I probably like you cause you remind me of myself
I'm all grown up, you all grown up
Don't cry though we been through a lot, so what?
We can make it through whatever, that's what I used to tell you, whenever you was down
But now it's whatever and everytime I talk to you, shit, it's whatever, whatever
But I can't say I wish I never met you, but I wish I never wish I let you get the best of me ever
Whatever, might as well say goodbye to yourself cause in the end
All a nigga really got is himself, true, I used to be down with O.P.P
Until other people's personalities told me some otherwise but otherwise don't quote me
Show me, I never let a nigga control me, that's O.D. what
And Imma tell you like, Barack told me
Heh heh listen check, I gotta call em' like I see em
Lil cousins only two swearin' next time imma teach him
Kids only three cursin' that's what y'all teach em
Turn around and beat him kinda hard to believe it
Cut friends off cause Ion't really need em plus Iont really seem em
And iont wanna be em
I want a relationship, but I don't really need it now
Cause I got two reasons, Iont trust nobody and you ont trust me either and I don't blame you
Cause I don't trust me neither, anything you could do, I could do sweeter
And revenge is sweet, sweet like sugar, Ice tea can't (unavailable)

Everyone that I love got me let down (Yeah)
I just wanna be alone but I'm at shore
I just want peace, really not war
Maybe I just want you so I'm not bored (Yeah)
Maybe I don't wanna lose and I want more

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
And I'm sick of hidin' from all the jealousy (Woo)

You push me over the edge
Tryna disguise yourself as someone that I like
'Cause I know I won't let you up under my covers
I sit with the angels, who come from the sky
You put dirt on my name, I put mud on my face
Ain't nothin' you can say, you got nothin' on me
I care less how you feel, motherfuck how you think
Fuck your attitude, you ain't NWA
I'm just hopin' that you don't bring trouble my way
All you good for is drama and causin' me problems
And I'll do without you, yeah I'm fine without you
'Cause you just a monster and you just a [?]
And you God damn [?], you dead to me dead
And forever and ever, don't call me whenever
Don't reach out to me, I don't wanna talk to you

Hope I never see you again in my life and if I throw a party know you ain't invited at all

Ok my momma said I'm fuckin' up
My daddy say I'm negative
And my grandma said my head is big
And my doc said I need medicine
And my uncle say I'm selfish
And my auntie say I'm helpless
And my cousin said let's fuck bitches and get money and sell bricks
And my teacher said I'm a failure
And I ain't never gon be shit
Imma live fast and die young when that time comes Imma sleep quick
And my girl told me you're never there and I never cared bout nothing else
You don't love me, you love yourself I told the bitch you something else
You, you something else, something else unusual
And I'm sorry girl you're beautiful and I'm not the man you used to know I'm
So different now, real different now, just hear me out
I just wanna get rich and die tryin'. If not, then I die hoping
I'm waking up with my eyes closed, go to sleep with my eyes open
Four friends in my Tahoe realizing I'm not focused
I place hands on that Bible and promised God that I stop smoking
The yacht open, my block holdin' them shots open them too
There's three sides of a story inside my side of the truth
You can see it in my eyes I guess time flies when it's you
Niggas need me in they top 5 and that's top 5 of my crew
So fuck a paystub and that work life
9 to 5 that's your life
Take it slow, I heard fast relationships don't work right
I'm Joyner Lucas you heard right
Most niggas gon hear wrong and it's funny cause they cheer on and they probably won't be here long, nah
That's far as I need to get
Cops talking they need the tip
I don't know I plead the fifth
I need to sip Henny shots, every smoke get high to def
I'm tripping on my ego, well this the negative side effects, so

Shit, I never had no enemies, remember me?
Young nigga, that pretty boy with a new name
Tattoos and 2 chains like Tity Boi no loose change
Dogs walking on two legs
Weird niggas, I'm here, listen my ambition like Cool J
So don't call it no comeback
Feeling like Big Pun back
You ain't shooting, you pussy niggas, so bitch give me my gun back
Scared of noise like, ""What's that?""
I'm a Bad Boy where Puff at?
And everything you say you did I pretty much don done that (Whoo!)
At high school I was tripping hard
Skipping class, up in the hall
Stealing clothes all in the mall, and fighting niggas, I did it all
Selling crack in rental cars
My heart told me you sinning hard
I went to church the pastor told me, ""What the fuck is you living for?""
And that's as real as I need to get
My girl asked if I cheated on her, I don't know I plead the fifth
I need to sip Henny shots, if you smoke get high to def
I'm tripping on my ego and this the negative side effects, so

Say I'll do my thing just because I need to fuck what you hoe niggas thinking?
Tryna make it all stat with the cash in a wrap and I'm fuckin' your hoes on the weekend
Maybe pass in the back now I'm passing the black matter fact how you hoes wanna do this?
Super stupid, dark as chocolate, big pocket, Joyner Lucas
I'm a fool, let me get it all too
Fuck your girl in the pillow I'll drool
Fuck this world, when I fuck your girl, Imma flex so hard when I fuckin' curl
You feel it, haters stoppin', Trayvon Martin, but gun concealin'
I pop if you [?], man give you balls, you ain't feeling it, uh
Y'all niggas ain't cool, y'all niggas ain't hot, y'all niggas ain't nothing different
Y'all niggas ain't do the most [?], y'all niggas ain't even pimpin'
Probably got your bitches dry as fuck and I keep it drippin'
Ay ay, with your baby, you keep her sober, I keep her sippin'
Big difference, from bitchin' pitchin', switchin' words to a vision and flippin' birds in the kitchen, they slick, conversing with women the frickin' nerve of you niggas
Tryna tell us that we ain't the greatest
We love to love and give the same to haters
Can't fade away, let's just play to play this
I'm good, these niggas just mad 'coz me and my niggas got hoes on speed dial
So they hittin' they phone and they don't pick up and they hang once more with the redial
Leased out when I pee now
Probably fuck dirty bitches and you when I'm senile
Future's what I see now, take a puff of the blunt if you really wanna see how
Rappers, gangstas, killers, smokers, bunch of niggas with feelings
Models, hoes, and strippers, hookers, bunch of bitches with children

And I spit so hard you can dive inside my drool, go swimming and float

Gotta hide my shit, when I ride by you, finna pop my shit, better stop that shit you know better

I catch you chillin' with the wrong motherfuckers
Explode your crib put a bomb in the oven
With a match in the wick in the back of the truck when you catch your shit, I be laughing or something
While I'm walking on trains in the back of the tunnel
On the ground, escape [?]
And grab me a gun just blast me a nun
Don't pass me the blunt, just pass me the lunch
I eat that plate and I need that cake
When I see that bank Imma need that safe
Imma need that cave, when I see that Jake, Imma squeeze that thing
When you see that flame, you gon' need that cane, Imma leave that pain
Imma eat that brain, I don't need champagne, I don't eat pancakes

Trappin on the block with a choppa in the car but I never got caught
You heard all about me couple niggas try to out me but they never got far
Shares to the dre's couple shots to the face and the rest is all yours
Don't smile at my face with your drills at your face like a nigga Paul Walsh
Got shooters and them niggas all talk
Jail posed with a cellphone and my niggas all call
Few problems that I'm never gon solve
Couple bad bitches with some kids so I never go raw swear to God that I never go hard
Drunk sex on a rollercoaster bitch you better hold on and my Cadillac really so soft
Shit Ima die in the booth till the heavens gon call

[Chorus]

Falls off the edge
Fall slowly

[Refrain: Joyner Lucas]
I love you more than I love myself
If I weren't with you, I can't picture me with someone else
And every time we separate it's like we under spells
'Cause when we hurt each other we come back to help each other heal
You say I'm crazy, but at least you know my love is real
But shit, you crazy too, and that's why they say love is hell
And it's forever, so I hope you never up and bail
And if you ever left me for someone, you gon' get someone killed

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
You know the vibes we on be like some movie shit (Word)
And we don't always get along, but when we do, we lit (Lit)
I never understood love or what it truly is until I met you
Now we just inseparable until we trip (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
And every time you try to leave, I'm chasin' after you (Chasin' after you)
And every time I go, I keep on comin' back to you (Comin' back)
'Cause you belong to me, and I'm the other half of you
And as much as I need you, deep down I know I'm bad for you
You know I'm bad for you (Bad for you, bad for you)

Maybe that's why we stick together like cursive (Like cursive)
Hella toxic, but I know that I'm determined
If we can make it through the fire, we can breathe inside a furnace (Facts)
Your family never liked me, they all think that I'm a burden
They know when we're together you're a different type of person (True)
Whenever things get bad, it never seems like it's worth it
It's like we're drownin' really fast until we get back to the surface
And we never learnin' self-love (Yeah)
So we been there for each other when no one else was (No one else was)
And all the times I was broke and you kept me held up
And got me back focused or held me down when I felt stuck (Word)

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
And every time I try to leave, you're chasin' after me (Chasin' after me)
And every time you leave, you keep on comin' back to me (Comin' back)

Joyner, Joyner, Joyner

[Verse 1]
Uh, put the cause on the totem, put the balls on the boat
And hit 'em all with the motive
Joyner's all in the focus
And the blogs want to post a niggas songs and you notice
I'm a star, undervoted
I'm a dog, I'm a Doberman pinscher, you a pony
You a unicorn, Louis Vuitton, sneakers on woadie
Trying to be up on me and my niggas like you know me
You don't me
You just know what the people wanna tell ya
Talkin' on the low, but the speakers gon' kill ya
Sleepin' on my back with the TV on the ceilin'
Got Jeezy on, chillin' with the kiwi hard sippin'
E'erybody wanna live like Tony Montana
Sniffin' out the coke with the homie, don-da-da
Drug dealin', bang bang, with the phony bandanna
'Til the homies run right up in your cozy mañana
That's real
Fuck a talk
Funny how a funny nigga come across
Funny how the money make a sucker talk
When it feel good like a nigga took the rubber off
I see both sides like tug-a-war
Joyner's on fire, close the oven door
Beat the pussy up like a drummer boy
Thought you ran the city, what the fuck you niggas runnin' for?
Fuck the law
Tell the politician I'm a terrorist
And tell the government that I'm a colored kid
Tryna make a penny off of half a G
And that'll be the day you catch me workin' at a god damn Applebee's
Nigga, don't be dappin' me
'Cause we ain't got shit to talk about unless you talkin' 'bout a salary
And rappers wanna talk about battle me
But they can suck my dick with a mouth full of cavities
Oh, you in trouble
And I love it how they hate you
But they actin' like they love you
Then they kiss you, then they hug you
Make a screwed face at you
Middle finger saying ""Fuck you, nigga""
That's just motivation
I ain't hatin' like a sucker
But I treat you like a slugger
Uppercut you 'til you crumble
Have you singin' like Usher
You a dish to my supper
Motherfuck a nigga, uh

[Interlude]
Jurisdiction
Regarded as mercilessly destructive and unstoppable
Something that demands blind devotion
Or sacrifice
What are you willing to sacrifice?
To censor the word is ground
When you can, it's comparable
To mean something more than
Jurisdiction

[Verse 2]
I see a bunch of sentimental niggas
In the ghetto while I’m sittin’
On a Level while I’m spittin’
Instrumental [?] went on trippin’
Independent Independent
On the feelin or the mission
I go heaven it hadn’t been an aberration
I ain’t selling crack I did it
But my other [?] was tripping
And my brother has some bitches
I be fucking I was different
And I know it
You was on my Jurisdicton
And I saw it
You ain’t know what I’d had been through
I don’t hate ‘em make no friends
And I don’t care about potential
I don’t care to make it simple
Take advantage of your mental
I’m a idol
You just wanna infiltrate me
You the smartest
Little kids talkin’ cray
Sayin’ they just wann’ be like Tony Montana
Sniffin' out the coke with the homies, don-da-da
Drug dealin', bang bang, with the phony bandanna
'Til the homies run right up in your cozy mañana
That's real
Tough or not
Funny how a funny nigga talk a lot
Funny how the money make a sucker pop
‘Cause it feel good like a nigga took a puff of rock
But I can give a damn if he tough or not
Joyner’s on fire like the oven’s hot
Beat the pussy up like a Juggernaut
Say you run the city what the fuck you niggas talking ‘bout
Fuck the law
Tell the government that I’m a terrorist
And tell the president that I’m a colored kid
Tryna make a penny of a half a G
And that'll be the day you catch me workin' at a god damn Applebee's

Leave me alone
Y'all ever heard of that term
What's it called, uh
Fatal attraction
Well this story right here
It's like that
Thin line between love and hate times ten
You be the judge

[Verse 1]
She sent me one-hundred and fifty letters sayin' we should be together
And how we should meet each other, when are we gon' see each other
Blowin' up my phone, I ain't even give my number
Leavin' voicemails to my fuckin' brother and my mother
Photoshopping pictures with me and my sister on it
Cut my little sister's head off and stuck her picture on it
She tatted Future Joyner on her titties and her stomach
Tellin' me that if we fuck she [? 0:39] for my brothers
Middle of the night she was in my fuckin' dreams
With a knife tellin' me that ""It ain't really what it seems
I'll slice your fuckin' throat nigga, don't you even scream
Future Joyner don't you love me baby, we can be a team
Stick together, you and me forever, Batman and Robin
Or I'll cut your fuckin' dick off like I'm Lorena Bobbitt""
I woke up, jumped in the whip and tried to leave
But she was in the backseat with my keys like ""Uh-uh-uh
It's you and me""

[Verse 2]
She snuck in my hotel room
Lookin' all seductive, almost fell for it
Put my phone in her panties, tied me to the headboard
Shoved a pill down my throat and then my body felt sore
I woke up in the prison right before they shut the cell door
""Officer what fuck?"" he said ""Nigga listen
Since you wanna rape women, you gon' be somebody's bitch"" and
I was trippin' like ""Nigga what? You got it fucked up""
He said ""Keep your mouth shut, pussy, tell it to the judge""
I went to court the next day, she was in the stands
Slipped the cuffs of my hand, then I ran, goddamn
Took a right down the alley, gettin' chased by the feds
Made it to my nigga's house and she was layin' in the bed like
""You can't run from me Future, don't you understand
I'm your number one fan, what about our fuckin' plans?""
I said ""Bitch, you a crazy schizophrenic heffer leave
Won't you let me fuckin' breathe?"" She said ""Uh-uh-uh

This is a WJZ13 Eye Witness News Special Report
Good afternoon everybody, I'm Mary Buballa, we will join Dr. Phil in just a moment but first, breaking news out of Silverspring, Maryland
A gunman has entered the Discovery Channel building on Georgia Avenue in Silverspring, and taken at least one hostage. We're gonna look at some video of the building
The man entered it around 1 this afternoon. It is not known if the man works there now or has worked there in the past
Police are not saying that anybody have been hurt at this point. Police are saying that the suspect does have concerns about the Discovery Channel-
He's making some demands I'm not getting into. We are-
The man needs to be listened to. Somebody needs to listen to this guy. I mean...
We just received word the suspect is 23 year old black male. We have a name. Future. Future Joyner. He's not backing down, he's determined-
He's apparently some sort of rapper
Somebody needs to listen to this kid
Somebody really needs to listen to this guy before he kills people-

Let's go
Yeah
Let's get 'em, oh

[Verse]
My father showed me love but it wasn't enough
So I grew up a lit fuse or blow up on a bus
These fuckers treat me like a nigga ain't suffer enough
What? (No hard feelings, dawg, it's all good, I see you)
Now I raise hell like Satan is back
Abrasion, it hurting, aching and scratching, aim for you back
I'm the equivalent to Ronald Reagan raping the track
Nasty (I'm finna catch up, ten cents of angel)
Bullemic what I'm eating, what's the meaning of life
I had a meet up with a demon and my dream with a knife (Yeah)
I beat your cheek with an Adidas 'till you eating the stripes
Bitch (I ain't mean to do it but I have to, durr)
I'm steaming while I'm freezing in a G2 Fury
Diving down into the ocean with my deep blue jury
I stab your face with a clab and make sea food chilly
Yeah (Take your lobsters off, post these niggas, magnet)
I paint a perfect picture, need some abstract colors
Too half ass, so bad luck like two black ass niggas
Division, clap the one ho like two half-black brothas, oww
My mother showed me love but I needed some more
So I grew up an angry nigga just to even the score
Watch your wrist get shined, while we eat off the floor
Damn (That's tough but I get mine though)
Drunk driving, diving off an air plane propeller
With a stolen umbrella 'cause my parachute have bullet holes
Police helicopters shooting so I could have pulled those
The final gravity falling rapidly with my fitted loaf
Cutting flow can rock shit, can hop big, can spinach blow
Heart's shaking, heart's break, thoughts racing, criminals
Every five seconds like getting more difficult
(And you know it's- it's gon' start get harder too)
I don't think I fear the rest, punch you in your ear and neck (Blah)
Man in the mirror, Mike Jackson and I manifest
180-prayer connect, call me if you fear of death
(I don't fear shit but Jesus, nigga)
Bloody paw prints when I smack the shit out of ghost
Pull the crust out the globe, had to cuss out the sober
Mixing up alcohol, I'm the drug Al Capone
(A young nigga might know me as Joyner)
You can call me Garry Lucas Jr
Mr. Super Duper shoot bazookas, packing two belugas
Smoking hookah, need to prove the movement
Losing, skip the grove, and here we use the rulers
(Two thumbs down for y'all wack niggas, hey)
You walking on a fine line

And I always dreamed of having that Lamborghini
Till a nigga done seen that price tag
So for now I guess it's just me in that hoopty
And that sucks bad
But til I get rich its just me and my bus pass
And I love rap
But If I could, I be
On top of world where they watch me
With a brand new chick cause the one that I'm with, wanna play more games than Yahtzee
She a One Oh Six, that's Roxy
No smoke, no dro, no broccoli
No sticks, no stems, no parsley (Shit)
No cribs, no bibs, no car seats
Don't hold your breath I'm cocky
All white lets dress like Nazi
I'm so so def like Foxy
Let's step like Bobby
But don't go just yet, just try me
Just us, no eye like Visine
Bet we won't stop like Molly
And I'm so so fresh like Andre
And lets do this shit for Tom's sake
Can you handle the fun?
I just wanna be your man for the month
Ask your niggas, don't care for the front
And that's no lie, I won't stop
Red fox like [?] to the sun
And I know why, love kills so don't put your hands on a gun
Back when a nigga ate Ramen Noodles, I was snug
Watching niggas get all kind of love
Shit, I didn't really know what time it was

She mean a lot to you but I don't give a fuck about her ('bout her, 'bout her)

When I'm rich, they'll be jags that I'm drippin' outta (Outta, outta)
So what the fuck I gotta do to make a couple dollars? (Dollars, dollars)
Life's a bitch, you shouldn't press your luck around her ('round her, 'round her)
Just throw a condom on, but fuck a [?] ([?], [?])

Everybody call me Joyner but my Mom different (Different)

Wave strong enough to fucking stop a truck
Smack you with a hockey puck, rip your fucking pockets off your Hollister

Yeah Yeah. Yeah

Verse:
I can rap backward reverse into back to frontwards
I'm a rappin' hustler, snatchin' lunches to pack-o-punches
Sellin' crack to cousins, heroin's needles, and acupuncture's
'Til yo' back is ruptured, open it up like a pack of mustard
I got a million ways I can kill you and have you suffer
Like tie you to the boat by your legs and then drag you under
Or blow your brains out of your face 'to a plastic cover
'Til it's cracked and crushin' and it explodes like a pack of gushers
Tell your favorite rappers I'm home and I'm back for supper
The day you beat me's the day Chilli gеt back with Usher
You spent your whole lifе tryna' ball, but ain't have no jumpers
I can pass and dunk it I'm Doctor J when I'm at the Rucker
Yo, this is for them days I was down and ain't had no uppers
Then I started sellin' dope just to live like the average hustler
If you think my net worth's a million you ain't addin' numbers
Oh, you lack n' lusted, life is a bitch 'til I grab the rubber

Verse: (reversed)
Look
I been grabbin' rubbers, bitches of life, but I'm lack n' lusted
If you add the numbers your net worths of a average hustler
Dope sellin' packin', back in the day we ain't had no upper
I was down and under I'm J Docterin' at the Rucker
Never had no jumper, tryna ball and get back to supper
Eatin bags of mustard, back when Chilli got back with Usher
Home [?] is favorite, bag of gushers and you explodin'
'Til you crack and crushin', brains blow through a plastic cover
Niggas drag you under, grab the boat, and have you suffer
Million ways to kill you, fold you up 'til yo' back is ruptured
[?] back bustin', needle's heroin acupunctured
And I'm packin' punches rappin' reverse and then back to frontwards

Verse:
Look
Let me shake the pavement, under the ground of the land you stay in
Cut the weight until the razor breakin' while I break the wakin'
I creep through your neighbor's place without a neighbor wakin'
And I raise the stakes and then aim it while 50 raisin' Kanan
I raise a razor blade to your face 'til you make a payment
I ain't complainin' you a dead man walkin', it ain't decayin'
I take the paper plate full of steak and I make my way in
Into Hell's Kitchen while waitin' for Satan to make an apron
I'm a backwards person in a Maybach with a backwards curtain
With a rappers girlfriend on my way back from they plastic surgeon
Trappin' workin' droppin' off bags for the addicts lurkin'
But they actin' nervous 'til I unwrap they ain't have no urges
In a glass of Bourbon, I'mma pull up in a black suburban
Glasses person, leave his whole family casket searchin', uh
When my bitch say she back to virgin, I was laughin', smirkin'
And told the bitch ""give me back the Birkin""

Verse: (Reversed)
Let's reverse it
The Birkin bag had a smirk and she was laughing nervous
Gave the virgin back to rehearse to start casket searchin'
Plastics person, in suburban black glass suburban
Cuz I had my urges when I unwrap and I had them nervous
Lurkin' addicts, waiting for bags that I drop to work and
When I'm trapping work and then plastic packages at your service
I’m a plastic surgeon up in the back with a rappers girlfriend
With the curtains backwards in the Maybach and I’m back reversing
The apron I made was to sit and wait as a waiter, in the kitchen with the plate dipping cuz I'm paid as a paper
I fuck hoes, dead and leave them decaying later
Walkin' a dead man to heaven just to complain to the maker
Cuz his payment was later, I raise a blade and a razor
Tell 50 Kanan raising the gage waking the neighbor
Break the razor, I'm in the ground in the basement layer
The payment station, stay in yo lane in the pavement shaker

It's OK that you got two kids
Got no man

And it's alright that you leave on your own
Handling on your own
Got two feet and you stand on your own
Girl, you look better when you standing alone
It's OK!
You stay in the house, never go out
Low profile and you never show out
You stay within your circle so no man can ever hurt you
Even if he know how!
It's alright that you don't know how to love
You've been too busy finishing school all in a new city
And TLC, nigga you feel un-pretty
Bitch fly and the motherfucker
It's OK if you don't smoke weed, don't drink much!
You talk too low and you never say much!
Appreciate life and you never hate much!
It's alright if you've got no ass, got no hips
Dance all alone on this night out
Bitch, you're beautiful from the inside out!
Yeah, it's cool, your heart turned cold
Enough's enough cause the last nigga done fucked it up
Now you're just single, never want another nigga
Never wanna give your heart again!
It's alright!
It's snowing and it's gonna rain
First comes joy and then comes pain, yeah
No one's perfect, and it's no way

She said she grew up with no mama
And never knew her papa
No-one to adopt her
Her grandma in a doctor's and her grandpa in a coma
No-one to console her
The winds start to get stronger and them nights start to get colder and her heart start to get weaker
She wonder why she breathing
She started thinking ""nothing worse than living life with no meaning when there's nothing else to believe in
And your dreams shattered in pieces""
Started feeling like Jesus in this world surrounded by demons
Every fucking day is a problem
Fired from her new job, and
She prostitutin' for dollars just to pay her way through college
But this shit is making her weak
And the pills making her sleep
And the niggas taking her drinks and left her for dead, raped in the street
Her life was prolly laying uncovered
But ain't nobody know nothing
And the ambulance just rushed her to the hospital to resuscitate and back to life she made it
But inside she died, despite the agonies that she faced she picked the pieces up and got straight and said she'd find a way

[Chorus]
Find a way x17

Parents on vacation
Left home with no trace he started hanging out with them gangsters, yeah, them muhfuckers from [?]
Running round with no patience
The sky start to get darker and them nights start to get dangerous and his mind start to get weak
Contemplating 'bout leaving
Started thinking ""ain't nothing worse than living life with no meaning
When there's nothing else to believe in
And your dreams shattered in pieces""
Started feeling all real and ready, so he signed up for the military
Guess fighting War is his way to vic'
The fucking up gon pay the rent
Met a girl, he made a friend
He loved her kids like they were his
He found love, and it's sweet
But the War making him weak
Put a bullet right in the cheek
And left him for dead right in the street
His life was prolly laying uncovered
And them soldiers can't stop bustin'
And the helicopter just rushed him to the hospital to resuscitate and back to life he made it
And later on he got married, heard his wife was having a baby, homie, big congratulations, cuz he found a way

[Chorus]
Found a way x17
[Outro speech]
People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing and it's totally true and the reason is, uh, because it's so hard that if you don't, any rational person would give up. It's really hard, and you have to do it over a sustained period of time, so if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it, if you don't really love it, you're gonna give up (""Find a way"" x 17) and that's what happens to most people actually, if you're looking at the ones that ended up y'know, being successful on quote ""the eyes of society"" and the ones that didn't, oftentimes, it's the ones that were successful loved what they did so they could persevere, y'know and come to the top, and the ones that didn't love it quit, because they're sane, like, who would wanna put up with this stuff if you don't love it?

Let it run, yeah, Joyner...

[Chorus]
'Cause every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if I'll feel it
'Cause every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if ...

[Verse 1]
Life's passing me by, people just staring at me
Letting down a window, smoking my new kush
And all I ever wanted was to make my parents happy
The good American dream, life is too short
And fairy tales don't exist, you don't get shit from Santa
Pockets emppty to press, sleeping in different trailers
I'm dreaming condos in Vegas, maybe on in Atlanta
Pro'lly cop me a mansion out on a different planet
Blindfolded and bounded I guess I couldn't see
Watching niggas who made thinking: ""That could be me""
Maybe I could be famous, maybe I could be free
Maybe I should just take the pain that you took from me
Remember, family first, though we were unstable
Who would've known that my could be my fucking angel?
I wouldn't made it this far if it wasn't for your halo
I promise soon as I make it we all gon' be fuego

[Verse 2]
Just a youngin with [?]
No direction I found myself in the face of fear
If I close my eyes maybe I disappear
My subconscious was spinning feelings but interfering
I told God: ""If you take this pain then I'll stop sinning""
I got some brothers, we conversated for 5 minutes
We barely know each other, I think it's the time difference
Sometimes I blame myself when I spend no time with 'em
Never been a gangster, I'm cut from a different cloth
Don't think I'm weak 'cus you'll get to see if you piss me off
Turn off the TV and brain-repeating and you niggas lost
Your whole generation is built on some shit you saw
Haven't spoken a while, but ain't no feelings lost
And to date, you're my father, we've been through shit before
Because it wasn't so easy cutting a nigga off
I'm tired of facing these bridges we never get across

But when I start to daydream
My mind turns straight to drawing

I like to use words like 'crikey,'
I like to use words like 'Yut.'
I like to use words about girls
But when I stop my talking
My mind turns straight to drawing

I like to hang out with Rachel
I like to kick back with Malik
But when left alone

Time to step past Breen’s Plan
No one can believe that I said that
“He’s canned”
Now I’m on a rise like a Jet-Pack
Someone get a wet vac
Flow so wavy like a sea man
He can
Rap about Biscuit
Him them with a diss kid
Now he’s on his way to make this song
What a risk this
Is
Better get
Attention
Mention me
When they mention
Sickness
My mind got a mind of its own
This time imma rap like a goat

Verse 2
Finna get payed
No more minimum wage
Put the words in a clip of AK
And I shoot up the page
And I vacay to vacant places
In case upper case
Keyboard talking to me
Like I’m finna get a B
But I’m back on my A game
Lacking the neigh say
Pack up a suitcase
Back who do you say
Rap is a two way
Rap is a new game
Attack like I’m two face
Lacking the fruit cakes
Apples and matter fact
Grab a few grapes
Go to school in two days
On a Tuesday
Go slap a student and call out “bonk gang”
Give him a goose egg
Give him some Koolaid
I don’t even need to make sense
Cause either way
I’m too great
Everyone tryna act like they are better
Throw me a beat and I’ll freeze like the weather
Listen to me and you’ll know that I’ve never been
Less than a king
Mufasa
A trend setter
Flow so cold like I’m on an ice cap
So loco get it when I write that
And the fact I ain’t human I’ll hide that
I ain’t Black Panther: I’m a white cat

Time to Flex like the Tape on the TV
Call me Phill Swift
Imma make it you’ll see
Listen to Mr. Clean
Sesame Street
And that one song that uses this very same beat
I’m musically talented
Using it balance
Abuse it I basically
Cancel the sound of it
Basically battle the packet of Algebra
Rap and I skip on the homework cause that is my second priority
First is me
It is conceded
But that’s what it needs to be
Man I don’t mean to be
Mean
I’m a beacon
I’m seeking
Can’t see when I’m behind these pieces of crap
I begin to weep like I’m meeting a casket
Peek in and see that it’s me
In the basket
We couldn’t even

7258185,Joyner Lucas,Sometimes,"2 ContributorsSometimes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Okay, I grew up with the regular thugs, I thought I'd tell you that
I thought, I thought you noticed that
Hanging with the hustlers, gettin' love from all the older cats
Listening to B.I.G., taking notes whenever Hov would rap
Looking up to Pun trynna learn to rhyme
Fantasized about Kim when I was only nine
I still remember when Nas told me the world is mine
But it was dark and hella tight around that fuckin' time
I never really had no money, all the pressure was free
Nowadays I'm out for presidents to represent me
Nowadays I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
You only think that you the shit because you never met me
Shit, I've been vibin' out since I was two
Back when Puff and Mase was wearing them shiny suits
Back when Wu-Tang was killing shit and I salute
Swear I shed a tear to Ghostface's ""All that I got is you""
Yeah I'm influenced by the leaders of the East Coast, music to the death of me
Big L, Guru, Big Noyd rest in peace Jam Masta Jay too dammit
Lost a lot of great ones but they never'll vanish
I remember speaking Spanish, mami [?]
Let me hit you with the [?]
I remember bumping Fugees back when Lauryn Hill was there
Back when she would sing the sweetest shit a man can ever hear
Cyrus put me on the Onyx back when I was twelve
'Til I stole the tape and started jamming by myself
Shit Noreaga made me feel like I could be myself
Then got convicted saying some shit that everybody felt
And that's just real

Sometimes I wanna cry and pry
Somtimes, sometimes I wanna chillay
Sometimes, sometimes I get drunk all God damn day
Sometimes I wanna go back around the way
Sometimes I wanna ride and smoke
Sometimes, sometimes I got money and I still feel broke

[Verse 2]
I guess my middle name must be He-Ain't-Shit
Every time I'm in the club bitches be like: ""He ain't shit!""
All of my niggas know we ain't shit
It's some niggas trynna make it out this pre-game shit, word
I break bread, red, hundred dollar bills
Had to go independent I was running out of deals
Low commission, I was free as can be
Now a nigga back in business like I'm EPMD
Wishing I could be Talib like a motherfucker
Living just to get by is not enough for us
Couple kids and the government be blessed of us
I guess this is it, knock your niggas' blockbusters
[?], fuck what you talkin' 'bout
I used to bust some Cool J's, momma said: ""I'll knock you out!""
A boombox, two pays to clean your Cogney mouth
With the ill nine or two ways to meet Foxy Brown
Yeah I'm influenced by the leaders of the East Coast, music to the death of me
ODB, MCA, Freaky Tah, rest in peace Jam Masta Jay too dammit
Lost a lot of great ones but they never'll vanish
I remember bumping Lost Boyz, I ain't even care
Let me hit you with the Black Rob shit until you scared
I remember bumping Black Moon and Buckshot, I was there
Back when he would say the hardest shit a man could ever hear
Daddy put me on the gangsters when I was twelve
'Til I stole the tape and started jamming by myself
Noreaga made me feel like I could be myself
Like I can vent and say some shit that everbody felt
And that's just real
[Chorus x3]
Sometimes I wanna cry and pry
Somtimes, sometimes I wanna chillay
Sometimes, sometimes I get drunk all God damn day
Sometimes I wanna go back around the way
Sometimes I wanna ride and smoke
Sometimes, sometimes I got money and I still feel broke

[Outro]
Ayo shout out to all the different regions that helped to build this hip hop shit and make it great
West, South
But on this one I wanted to talk about where I'm from and some of the shit that inspired me coming up
See, young niggas from the East Coast don't really pay homage no more, and I know there were those that paved the way for me
Out here, and I wanted to acknowledge y'all, word

7553202,Joyner Lucas,SOC105-I’m not racist,"1 ContributorSOC105-I’m not racist LyricsWith all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin' ""Black Lives Matter""
All the black guys rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin' ""Nigga this"" and ""Nigga that""
Call everybody ""Nigga"" and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say ""Nigga"" then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well, pound that then
Talkin' about slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done
I mean, you still trappеd in a rut
And I work my ass off and I pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' off free government assistancе?
Food stamps for your children, but you're still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckas needa get your damn priorities straight
Wait, it's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck and you'd rather sell drugs
Than get a job and be straight, and then you turn around and complain
About the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face!
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
""They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom""
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy
Got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my god!
And all you care about is rappin'
And stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rotting your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, same with the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect
You gon' stand for this country, nigga
I'm not racist
I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Put your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on
Take that du-rag off
Take that gold out your mouth
Quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police would stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same buildin' but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours...
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear
With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming ""All Lives Matter""
Is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word ""Nigga"" is a different sin
We shouldn't say it but we do, and that just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga, that word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmomma was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfucking sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfucking taxes, when I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Tryna steal black culture and then make it your own, whoa
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you 'on't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You 'on't know about no fried chicken and no barbeque
You 'on't know about the two-step or no loose change
You 'on't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you 'on't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated president Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died nigga, die nigga
And all you care about is money and power
And being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody, except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent
But, I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' everytime I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same buildin' but splittin' the both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'

Beef is brothers dyin' over shit that never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast

And 5'9"" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we still the gang-dum
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
Rattpack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard

Now its fucking lost
And its all your fault
Happy Birthday Nigga
Sometimes I wanna kill myself so I don't have to deal wit' you
I know it sounds harsh but I'm just being real wit' you
And I ain't looking forward to none of that father shit
I ain't got time for that type of shit
And your mom ain't gonna like this
But we ain't
Shooting no hoops
Flying kites
We ain't riding bikes
I hope you get your ass beat
I ain't teaching you how to fight
I ain't here to kiss you goodnight
I don't care to give you advice about girls
I hope you get your heart broken for dear life
I fucking hate you!...
And I know that its wrong
Sometimes I wanna explain but I don't know where to start
Cause you won't understand even if I told you my thoughts
Cause even when its light
I feel like I'm alone and its dark
My mind keeps racing fast
I can't bear with this pain I have
I can't stand you
And I hate the fact that you just a mistake
And that's just what the fuck you was
Everything was perfect
Now its fucking lost
And its all your fault
Happy Birthday Nigga
Shit I wanted to be a father so bad, I would give it all
Just to have my baby sit in my arms while I'm holding on
And to feel that beautiful feeling of love for my first born
Even play you the first song, that you hear when you first come
I loved your fucking mother so much I would give my heart
To be down to death do us part
Till I drown in a fucking pond
Till I burn in a blazing building
Apartment fire with bombs
Till I crash a Mercedes car, by a drunk drive on broad
With seven heaters on me
And then she fucking cheated on me
Drinking with her friends
And they didn't wanna leave the party
Got drunk and had sex
I ain't even see it coming
And then we find out she was pregnant
And she keeping secrets from me
This don't make sense
And I felt my fucking heart cave in
The baby not mine
The paternity test came in
And the love is gone
Everything was perfect
Now its fucking lost
And its all your fault
