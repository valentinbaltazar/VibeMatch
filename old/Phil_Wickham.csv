How great the chasm that lay between us
How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke Your name into the night
Then through the darkness, Your lovingkindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul
The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
Jesus Christ, my living hope

[Verse 2]
Who could imagine so great a mercy?
What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
The God of ages stepped down from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
The King of Kings calls me His own
Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me

Then He breathed His last and bowed His head
The Son of God and Man was dead
With bloody hands, tears on their face
They laid Him down inside that grave

But that wasn't the end
That wasn't the end

Let me tell you what happened next

The women came before the dawn
To find that stone already gone
When they looked inside, the angel said
""Why you lookin' for the livin' among the dead?""

You could have stepped into creation
With fire for all to see
Brought every tribe and nation to their knees
Arriving with the host of Heaven
In royal robe and crown
The rulers of the earth all bowing down
But You chose meekness over majesty
Wrapped Your power in humanity

[Chorus]
Glory be to You alone
King who reigns from a manger throne
My life, my praise, everything I own
To Jesus the King on a manger throne

[Verse 2]
You could have marched in all Your glory
Into the heart of Rome
Showed thеm splendor like they'd nеver known
But You wrote a better story
In humble Bethlehem
Creator in the arms of common men
You died for our redemption
And You rise so we can live

I see Your face in every sunrise
The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
The world awakens in the light of the day
I look up to the sky and say
You're beautiful
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)

[Verse 2]
I see Your power in the moonlit night
Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
We are amazed in the light of the stars
It's all proclaiming who You are
You're beautiful
(Oh, Oh, You're beautiful, Oh, Oh)

[Verse 3]
I see You there hanging on a tree
You bled and then You died and then You rose again for mе
Now You are sitting on Your heavenly thronе
Soon we will be coming home
You're beautiful
(Oh, Oh, You're beautiful, Oh, Oh)

[Verse 4]
Let's sing it out
When we arrive at eternity's shore
Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
Your bride will come together and we'll sing
You're beautiful

They'll make a Netflix series about us
The kind where you cry and smile at the same time
All the reviews will call it a triumph
But darling, you and I just call it life

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember the time when I first held your hand on Ocean Avenue
And when we stayed up late on Empire State, couldn't keep my eyes off you
And those blurry eyes and cloudy skies when you first said ""I do""
Well, I do too, I do too, I do too

[Chorus]
'Cause what we got is just too good
Just too good, just too good
What we got is just too good
Just too good, just too good

'Cause what we got is just too good
Just too good, oh, it's just too good

Where will you go when wells run dry?
When the wind starts to blow
How you gonna keep this flame alive?

[Pre-Chorus]
In the fading light when night is breaking
I know You will always be waiting
You'll always be there

[Chorus]
I'm running to the secret place
Where You are, where You are
I'll sing to You of all the ways
You stole my heart, stole my heart
Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running to the secret place

A voice is on the wind, it calls me further in
I'm heading deeper into Your heart
Your mark is on my chest, my sails filled with Your breath
You guide me by the light of the stars

I'm sailing on a ship that's bound for light
I wrestle with the wind against the tide
I leave it all behind to reach for more
I'm sailing on to Your golden shore

Though skies go blue to gray, and I'm thrown from wave to wave
You still will hear these lungs singing hard
With every storm I face, I find a greater grace
That pulls me deeper into Your heart

I wrestle with the wind against the tide

She sings to Him a lullaby

If You are the Sun
Then I wanna be the moon
I wanna reflect the light that shines from You
And if this is war
Then I’m gonna draw my sword
This time, I know what I am fighting for

[Pre-Chorus]
God, I wanna let You know
I want everything You are
I’m waiting for the morning light
To show a fire in the dark

[Chorus]
Shine Your light, I wanna feel You now
God, I need a miracle
Take my heart, make it glow
Shine Your light from the inside out
I wanna be more like You
If You are the Sun, then I wanna be the moon
And I wanna be the moon

[Verse 2]
If love is a choice
Then I need You to hear my voice
I’m the one knocking on Your door, making all this noise
Whatever it takes (Whatever it takes)
I give it all away
I wanna show my love in a thousand ways (Thousand ways)

Made from the dust and breathed into life
He stood unashamed with a fire in His eyes
The image of God
Walking upon the world

[Verse 2]
All of the Earth, was under His feet
Except for the fruit from a Forbidden Tree
He took a taste, and that's how He breaks the world

[Chorus]
He cried, ""Mercy
Mercy""
He broke the whole world with the fruit from a tree, have mercy

[Verse 3]
Heaven to Earth, came down from on high
With hope in His name, and a fire in His eyes
The fullness of God
Walking upon the world

[Verse 4]
He said He was love, then proved it with Blood
Rose from the dead to prove He was God
And that's what it takes
For One man to save the world

The battle line is drawn, it's all in black and white
Hope is going forward and fear from behind, it's time
It's time to make a move, so what will you decide?
The clock is ticking on, don't let it pass you by, it's time
It's time

[Chorus]
The time is now for lifting souls
The time is now for letting go
From your skin to your core
Let light and love come rushing through the door, oh, oh
Oh, come rushing through the door

[Verse 2]
You've learned every song, memorized the verse
Took the bread and wine and even bought the shirt, it's time
It's time to hold your shield, it's time to draw your sword
Let's be the resistance so, oh, Lord, oh, Lord, oh, Lord, it's time
Yeah, it's time

[Chorus]
The time is now for lifting souls
The time is now for letting go
From your skin to your core
Let light and love come rushing through the door
It's time to make a stand
So put your heart in greater hands
From your skin to your core
Let light and love come rushing through the door

I have looked you in the eyes

There is a God who understands

And I know you're tired and weak
But the God of perfect peace is right here

A great light dawns in Galilee
Some say madman, some say King
Wonder-workin' rebel priest
Jesus Christ the Nazarene

[Verse 2]
He knew well what it would take
To free us all from sin and grave
A perfect man would have to die
And only He could pay that price

[Chorus]
Friday's good 'cause Sunday is comin'
Don't lose hope 'cause Sunday is comin'
Devil, you're done, you better start runnin'
Friday's good 'cause Sunday is comin'

[Verse 3]
So He let those soldiers take Him in
As His friend betrayed Him with a kiss
And there before the mocking crowd
Like a Lamb to the slaughter, didn't make a sound

[Verse 4]
Then He carried that cross to Calvary
And He shed His blood to set us free
As the nails went in and the sky went dark
The redemption of the world was on His heart

The Son of God and Man was dead
With bloody hands, tears on their face
They laid Him down inside that grave

But that wasn't the end

That wasn't the end

To find that stone already gone

And only He could pay that price

So, He let those soldiers take Him in
As His friend betrayed Him with a kiss
There before the mocking crowd
Like a Lamb to the slaughter, didn't make a sound

And He shed His blood to set us free
As the nails went in and the sky went dark

From the darkness, I called Your name
Into darkness, Your mercy came
You called me out, lifted me up
How great is Your love

[Verse 2]
You bore my weakness, You took my shame
Buried my burdens in fields of grace
You called me out, lifted me up
How great is Your love

[Pre-Chorus]
From the heights of heaven, You stepped down to earth
Innocent perfection, gave Your life for us
We are amazed, we stand in awe
For we have been changed by the power of the cross

[Chorus]
How great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love for us

In Your presence, where I belong

Your glory boasts and the heavens shine
The saints and angels stand in awe
Captured by the beauty of it all
So i fall to my knees
But i can't bow low enough
I can't bow low enough
At the vision of You my God

I can't bow low enough
I can't bow low enough
At the vision of You my God
I can't hold it all inside

Death looks like an empty grave
Fear looks like a giant slain
Trials look like gifts of grace
When I look to Jesus

[Verse 2]
Failures bow to victory
Sin has lost its hold on me
In this love is all I see
When I look to Jesus

[Chorus]
How my heart leaps (How my heart leaps)
How my soul sings (How my soul sings)
For I know where my help comes from
Jesus sought me (Jesus sought me)
Jesus saved me (Jesus saved me)
Hallelujah
For all He's done

[Verse 3]
Every wall comes crashing down
Chains are broken on the ground
What can stand against us now
When wе look to Jesus? Yeh!

And I'll keep reaching out, reaching out for You

And I'll keep reaching out, reaching out for You

If I didn't have Your hand, if I couldn't look into Your eyes

Hold your position and you will see the salvation of the Lord on your behalf
And we know His name
We know His name, church
We know His name, friends
His name is Jesus
And all who call upon His name will be saved
For He died and He rose again, I'll never stop singin' about it
I cannot wait to sing this story next

Some say madman, some say King

And only Hе could pay that price

And there before the mocking crowd

And He shed His blood to set us free
As the nails went in and the sky went dark
The redemption of the world was on His heart

Then He breathed His last and bowed His head
The Son of God and Man was dead
With bloody hands, tears on their face
They laid Him down inside that grave
But that wasn't the end
No, that wasn't the end
And that wasn't the end
Let me tell you what happened next

To find that stone already gone
When they looked inside, the angel said

9108486,Phil Wickham,What Child Is This (Acoustic),"1 ContributorWhat Child Is This (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
What Child is this, who laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?

[Chorus]
This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary, yeah
Oh-ooh, mm

[Verse 2]
So bring Him, incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of Kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him, oh

[Chorus]
This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babе, the Son of Mary

Frosted windowpanes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way
He's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me

[Chorus]
It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Ev'ry song you hear, seems to say
""'Merry Christmas'
May your New Year's dreams come true""
And this song of mine
In three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours, the same thing too

[Instrumental Break]

It's that time of year
