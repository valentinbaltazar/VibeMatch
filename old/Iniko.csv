9019871,Iniko,Jericho,"30 ContributorsJericho Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm high, I'm from outer space
I got Milky Way for blood, evolution in my veins
I'm gone, I've been far away
I'm a lumineer now, make moves, start waves
I've been dreaming about flying for a long time
I had a vision from the greys, they want to co-sign
Artificially intelligent, new AI
I'm your future, past and present, I'm the fine line

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm the missing link of this illusion
I am not really here, I'm an intrusion
I don't swim or sink, I just float
I don't need gravity, I just need growth (Woah)

[Chorus]
When I move, it's an earthquake rumble
I will never, ever fall, never stumble
And I don't need to be humble
Break down walls, like Jericho, crumble

[Verse 2]
I can go higher
Pass the stratosphere, I can catch fire
I can go hard, I don't even need to try, yeah
Starblood, I don't ever get tired
Predestined, written in stone
I feel it coming in, I feel it in my bones
Heavily protected, never alone
Tapped in, I'm connected to the unknown (Woah, woah)

(Ohh)
I will be one of the greatest, that is a vow, yeah, that is a promise
Always wanted to be famous, just being real, yeah, just being honest
My haters gon' always be nameless, give them no clout, I give them no power
Creators built different, they ancient, sooner than later, all will be ours
I keep an eye out for the numbers, I stay in contact, synchronization
To infinity, even beyond it, I am a comet, no destination
A lot of things I am above and there are a lot of things that are above me
Do not come for the people I love, 'cause then I get scary, then I get ugly, (yeah)

[Chorus]
Ain't no problem when I'm the equation

I'm not new here, reborn creation
Come and find me, sending location
Ain't no problem when I'm the equation
Presence noted, observation
I'm not new here, reborn creation
Come and find me, sending location

[Verse 2]
Enlightened, they call me a siren
Through them, I receive my guidance
Don't keep it all in, don't fight it
Fire to a flame, ignite it
Rules make me more defiant
I will never be compliant, yeah, I got it down to a science
It's so much more than mindset
Gotta start right now, gotta change it
Take it all back, reclaim it
Don't bite your tongue, just say it
Don't get too high, stay weighted
Time to break down the matrix
They know that the mind can play tricks

6473948,Iniko,Luna,"4 ContributorsLuna Lyrics[Verse 1]
There once was a girl in a garden, who wondered one day what she'd be
Her soul and her mind did not harden, while watching the death of the leaves
She dug her hands in the dirt-filled ground, grasping for something unseen
Knowing that her powers had no bounds, she held on to the nothing in the leaves

Then suddenly, the earth gave a strong loud boom
And the dirt on the ground was nowhere to be found
And the girl turned into the moon, the girl turned into the moon

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
They say that she's still here now, watching and waiting for the howl (awoo)
A lover her kind, her skin that binds and washes over pale afternoons
Do not weep for me, I am not hungry anymore

I could be the place that you run to
Baby come through
You a fantasy
You might also like[Verse 2]
Caught you a wave then you drown in it
Your connection's infecting my godliness
Can you feel it? 'Cause I see it
And you'll see, come on breathe, let's just breathе it in

I'm so stuck on your taste I can't explain
The thing you do to my safе space
You become a lifeline, you become the veins, yeah
You remain in control like a videogame

[Chorus]
And I was really hoping
You got my notice
So can you notice me?
I could be the place that you run to
Baby come through
You a fantasy

I'm feeling that feeling
Reel it in and
Just count to three
I could be the place that you run to
Baby come through
You a fantasy
You're a fantasy
Fantasy
Fantasy

[Outro]
I'm so stuck on your taste I can't explain
The things you do to my safe space
You become a lifeline, you become the veins, yeah
You remain in control like a videogame1Embed",0,/songs/6763788,Motion by Iniko,https://images.genius.com/5c0b54327b956fdc09c3939d2bbe795d.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5c0b54327b956fdc09c3939d2bbe795d.500x500x1.jpg,13506902,complete,/Iniko-motion-lyrics,1,https://images.genius.com/5c0b54327b956fdc09c3939d2bbe795d.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5c0b54327b956fdc09c3939d2bbe795d.500x500x1.jpg,Motion,https://genius.com/Iniko-motion-lyrics,,,,,,,

Who asked this question:
Is it necessary to love?
Necessary to love, oh
Is it necessary to love?

10262181,Iniko,333,"1 Contributor333 Lyrics[Verse 1]
We can't go back, we can't go back
They had us chained, they cut our backs
We held our breath in bluest seas
Our bodies thrown into the deep

[Pre-Chrous]
They have drones, they are clones
They're ready for anyone and anything that knows
The truth you seek, the truth out there
It bangs on your door, grips at your bones

[Chorus]
And has you up at three in the morning, oh
We're sweating and groaning, wondering where we'll begin
At three in the morning, oh
Listening to the universe, her sеcrets are revеaled
Oh ah

[Verse 2]
Star children, I got news for you
This is a 3D world, it's corrupt and blue
They want your soul, they want your heart and mind
They wanna break us up and kill our kind

[Pre-Chorus]
They are ghosts, they are pale
They created the matrix, created a living hell
For those with skin like night and gold
They know we're the animals, we're cannibals
You might also like[Chorus]
They know all this up at three in the morning, oh
We're sweating and groaning, wondering where we'll begin
At three in the morning, oh
Listening to the universe, her secrets are revealed
Oh ah

[Outro]
Ooh
Three in the morning, ah
Sweating and growning
Three in the morning
Listening to the universe, her secrets are revealed
Aah
Aah-aah
Aah-aah
Aah-
