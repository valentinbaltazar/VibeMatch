2310399,Sara Bareilles,She Used to Be Mine,"48 ContributorsShe Used to Be Mine Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's not simple to say
Most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them

[Verse 2]
It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

[Chorus]
She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine

[Verse 3]
It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life
Just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person
Who makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
[Verse 4]
You're not what I asked for
If I'm honest, I know
I would give it all back for
A chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

[Bridge]
Who'll be reckless, just enough
Who'll get hurt
But who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used
By a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Used to be mine

[Outro]
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mineSee Sara Bareilles LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also like17Embed",14,/songs/2310399,She Used to Be Mine by Sara Bareilles,https://images.genius.com/03e6c25de8e73ef6ded33df34aa8b9ed.300x300x1.png,https://images.genius.com/03e6c25de8e73ef6ded33df34aa8b9ed.1000x1000x1.png,1717255,complete,/Sara-bareilles-she-used-to-be-mine-lyrics,17,https://images.genius.com/dc811294a0161bb9699650012a9fc460.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/dc811294a0161bb9699650012a9fc460.600x600x1.jpg,She Used to Be Mine,https://genius.com/Sara-bareilles-she-used-to-be-mine-lyrics,/albums/131350,https://images.genius.com/68ae42cff6aad444fdff68dd3fd34e48.1000x1000x1.png,What's Inside: Songs From Waitress by Sara Bareilles,131350.0,What’s Inside: Songs From Waitress,"November 6, 2015",https://genius.com/albums/Sara-bareilles/What-s-inside-songs-from-waitress

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out

I stick with real things
Usually facts and figures
When information's in its place I minimize the guessing game
Guess what?
I don't like guessing games or when I feel things
Before I know the feelings
How am I supposed to operate if I'm just tossed around by fate?
Like on an unexpected date

[Verse 2]
With a stranger who might talk too fast
Or ask me questions about myself before I've decided that
He can ask me questions about myself
He might sit too close
Or call the waiter by his first name
Or eat Oreos
But eat the cookie before the cream
But what scares me the most...
What scares me the most...

[Chorus 1]
Is what if when he sees me
What if he doesn't like it?
What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it
What happens then if
When he knows me
He's only disappointed?
What if I give myself away to only get it given back?
I couldn't live with that
So I'm just fine inside my shell-shaped mind
This way I get the best view
So when he sees me, I want him to

I'm not defensive
I'm simply being cautious
I can't risk reckless dating
Due to my miscalculating why
A certain suitor stands in line I've seen in movies
Most made for television
You cannot be too careful when it comes to sharing your life
I could end up a miserable wife

[Verse 4]
He could be criminal
Some sort of psychopath who escaped from an institution somewhere where they don't have girls
He could have masterminded some way to find me
He could be color blind
How untrustworthy is that? He could be less than kind
Or even worse, he could be very nice, have lovely eyes
And make me laugh
Come out of hiding
What do I do with that?
Oh god

[Chorus 2]
What if when he sees me
I like him and he knows it
What if he opens up a door and I can't close it?
What happens then?
If when he holds me
My heart is set in motion
I'm not prepared for that I'm scared of breaking open
But still I can't help from hoping
To find someone to talk to

I know you miss the world, the one you knew

Because you didn't know the truth, that's how it works

We're all just hunters seeking solid ground

Though I know it's blinding there's a way out
Say out loud, we will not give up on love now
No fear, don't you turn like Orpheus, just stay here
Hold me in the dark and when the day appears
We'll say we did not give up on love today

[Verse 2]
I'll show you good, restore your faith
I’ll try and somehow make a meaning of the poison in this place
Convince you, love, don’t breathe it in
You were written in the stars that we are swimming in
And it has no name, no guarantee
It's just the promise of a day I know that some may never see
But that’s enough, if the bottom drops out

Once upon another time
Somebody's hands who felt like mine
Turned the key and took a drive
Was free
Highway curve, the sun sank low
Buckley on the radio
Cigarette was burning slow
So breathe

[Chorus 1]
Just yellow lines and tire marks
And sun-kissed skin and handle bars
And where I stood was where I was to be
No enemies to call my own
No porch light on to pull me home
And where I was is beautiful
Because I was free

[Verse 2]
Once upon another time
Before I knew which life was mine
Before I left the child behind me
I saw myself in summer nights
And stars lit up like candle light
I make my wish but mostly I believed

And leave them on your doorstep

And I’ll bow out of place

When letting go is braver than keeping
When innocent words turn to lies
And you can't hide by closing your eyes

When pain is all that they offer
Like the kiss from the lips of a monster
You know the famine so well, but never met the feast
When home is the belly of the beast

The ocean is wild and over your head
And the boat beneath you is sinking
Don't need room for your bags, hope is all that you have
So say the Lord's Prayer twice, hold your babies tight
Surely someone will reach out a hand
And show you a safe place to land

Up in flames, being told to stand still

When I was a boy
Hardly more than ten years old
My family moved to a small town
And I was destroyed leaving all my friends behind
And if I'd had a choice, we'd've stayed put
It's only now I can see
Sometimes a little change can be good

At the end of the block
The ramshackle diner stood
My after school stop just to pass time
Where I met a girl nearly three times my age
But still, she painted my world with her kind words
And soft curves
Just a schoolboy crush
But you remind me of her

She saw something in me
I was lonely and misunderstood
She'd ask me to write down my wildest schemes
And over slices of blueberry pie
I learned to dream

We all just need someone to care
One who might listen and root for our wishes

If no one believes her‚ what good's a dreamer anyway?

Thank god for that place
It practically saved me
Those school kids sure didn't take kind to this stranger
And I was eccentric, all grand plans and inventions

It's a really old city
Stuck between the dead and the living
So I thought to myself, sitting on a graveyard shelf
As the echo of heartbeats, from the ground below my feet
Filled a cemetery in the center of Queens
I started running the maze of
The names and the dates, some older than others
The skyscrapers, little tombstone brothers
With Manhattan behind her, three million stunning reminders
Built a cemetery in the center of Queens

[Chorus]
You said, remember that life is
Not meant to be wasted
We can always be chasing the sun
So fill up your lungs and just run
But always be chasing the sun

[Verse 2]
So how do you do it
With just words and just music, capture the feeling
That my earth is somebody's ceiling
Can I deliver in sound, the weight of the ground
Of a cemetery in the center of Queens
There's a history through her
Sent to us as a gift from the future, to show us the proof
More than that, it's to dare us to move
And to open our eyes and to learn from the sky
From a cemetery in the center of Queens

All we can do is try
And live like we're still alive

[Verse 3]
It's a really old city
Stuck between the dead and the living
So I thought to myself, sitting on a graveyard shelf
And the gift of my heartbeat sounds like a symphony
Played by a cemetery in the center of Queens

[Chorus]
You said, remember that life is
Not meant to be wasted
We can always be chasing the sun
So fill up your lungs and just run
But always be chasing the sun

Back of the room
Looking at you
Counting the steps
Between us
A hundred and five
Little blades in a line
From your skin to mine
And I feel it
Eyes on the ground
But I can't look up now
Don't wanna give it away
My secret

[Pre-Chorus]
In another life
My teeth and tongue
Would speak aloud what until now
I've only sung

[Chorus]
'Cause I would die to make you mine
You bleed me dry each and every time
But I don't mind, no I don't mind it
I will come back 1000 times
You can make me wait forever

And I'll do the same, but won't mean it

Can carry the pain, but they don't free it

Console myself as I resign to release you

Again, again I let it go, let it go
Cover my mouth
Don't let a single word slip out
I wouldn't wanna tell you, no, tell you, no
Nothing could be worse
Than the risk of losing what I don't have now
I'm weaker by the minute, though
Is it so bad if I wanna cry out–

And bake from the heart

And now I'm yours and you are mine

An unsung melody is mine for safekeeping
And I will guard it with my life
I'd hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping
Starting here, and starting now
I can feel the heart of how

Oh my heart's at the wheel now
And all my mistakes, they make sense

It's for you, little lady
Is it all that you dreamed of?
Oh, if I knew what had been there waiting
I'd have screamed out and jumped up

Now here I am
With my feet on the sand
And a body that won't move
The tide's coming in
And I'm bound for a swim
In a pair of cement shoes

He takes what he can, what he wants
Doesn't matter if it's ever been given
I took the bait and a chance on a man
Sold by the boy that he lived in

And I was wrong to believe that strength makes you strong
And I had hope in a change I would see in us both
And now I'm heavy
He lifts me, but never once carried
Door number two, I've already walked through

Ask me the question:
Who coulda guessed I would be here at this crossroad?

But maybe I'm getting ready
And this might catch fire and char this ground

Who's gonna get let down
Will I be enough to get this on its way
To find some higher ground?

Hold my breath and I'll count to ten
I'm the paper and you're the pen
You fill me in, you are permanent
And you leave me to dry
I'm the writer and she's the muse
I'm the one that you always choose
She will falter and gift her blame
And it starts all over again
Again again again again..

[Chorus]
She is bright lights and cityscapes
And white lies and cavalcades
And she'll take all you ever have
But I'm gonna love you
You say, ""Maybe it'll last this time""
But I'm gonna love you
You'd never have to ask
I'm gonna love you
'Til you start looking back
I'm gonna love you so right
I wouldn't need a second chance

[Verse 2]
Shield your eyes from the truth at hand
Tell me why it'll be good again
All those demons are closing in
And I don't want you to burn
Nevermind what I said before
I don't want any less anymore
You are carbon and I am flame
I will rise and you will
Remain

Ooh

[Verse 1]
By the time you hear this, I'll be in the rearview mirror
I'll even wear that green dress you like, so when I disappear
You can turn around, one last look at the girl you lost
In the time you took to make up your mind between two roads
Go and take some more time, but me and mine must go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to wait it out, no more
I can't find the man I was waiting for

[Chorus]
I wanted to be your girl in a white T-shirt
Over coffee, stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
I wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin
Stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
(While you read me poetry by dead men)
While you read me poetry by dead men

[Verse 2]
By the time you hear this, who knows where I might be?
Singin' 'bout another near-miss love that ended incomplete
I was ready, but you weren't
So jump with your net from this bridge you've burned
I wanted to tell you things, all the secrets I've been keepin'
I saw it in front of me, but then you just kept disappearin'

Carry the weight of a lifetime

Scared what I’ll take from you, darling

I grew up an only child in a suburb of the city
Spent my days alone; my only friend was a stray kitty called Sardine
I thought it was hilarious to call a cat a kind of fish
She played hard to get, hissing while she scratched me
What she was trying to say was ""Ogie, come and catch me""
I learned quickly
That perseverance stood between a cat and her new best friend: me!

You may find yourself in the dead of night
Lost somewhere out there in the great big beautiful sky
You were all just perfect little satellites
Spinning 'round and 'round this broken earthly life

[Hook]
This is so you’ll know the sound
Of someone who loves you
From the ground
Tonight you're not alone at all
This is me sending out my satellite call

Waiting for the bus stop
Waiting for the concrete black top to settle down
Long enough for me to get off and get a little ground
I'm ready for the sea change
Helpless felt this coming from a mile away
And now you're looking at me babe, and how we'll separate if we can
Cause I still count on one hand the number of good men I know

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm standing on the edge with just a telephone wire
Trying to get to you first to say the world's on fire
Holding my breath until I know you're alright
Because the water will only rise
When will you realize

[Chorus]
You must become an island
You must become an island
You must become an island
And see for yourself that that's what I am

[Verse 2]
You always dirty up the windows
If you keep 'em at bay that way no one's gonna surprise you by getting too close
Anybody but me though
You've made exceptions to your rules

Smiles in the morning at me
Apartment on the second story
Strangers in a brand new city
Both remembering last night
Kitchen table and a bottle of wine
The only thing on my mind is you

[Pre-Chorus]
The way the moonlight flickered in
We were stars of some old classic film

[Chorus]
With Miss Simone
Singing, ""Pour some sugar in my bowl, baby""
In the glow of the candlelight, we danced all night
On the rooftop, thinking no one needs to know a thing
But Miss Simone
No one but Miss Simone

[Verse 2]
Moving boxes cover the floor
I've never quite been here before
Finally made a house feel like home
The years are flying past us now
But you and I have figured out how
To conjure up a feeling so true

How'd she know what a heart sounds like
In the glow of this candle on a rooftop in the moonlight?

Someday when we're old and gray
Sifting through our yesterdays
We'll pull that memory from its sleeve
And play that song of you and me

She has her back to me at the kitchen sink
I'm trying to read her mind, wondering
What she doesn't say to anybody
The laundry's folded, beds are made
It's like this every single day
It's memorized, but a thin disguise

[Chorus]
I see what she can't see
Her light only ever landed on me
But there's a glimmer in her brown eyes
The ones she gave to me
So I know we can both be shiny

[Verse 2]
She calls on Sundays, checking in
We talk about the weather again
It never changes, she wonders where the rain is
Once in a while I catch a glimpse
Of the truest things that she keeps hidden
Her secret heart, that's my favorite part

I see what she can't see
Her light only ever landing on me
But there's a glimmer in her brown eyes

Come in close, now it's time to tell the story:
Long ago, and so many years before we
Ever were, ever dreamed we even could be
There was her and her very first heartbeat
All alone in a corner of the night sky
Spiral bones of a supernova starlight
Fell in love with another burning bright
She dreamed of a way to ignite
She said

[Chorus]
""Tonight
Come on, come on, collide
Break me to pieces, I
I think you're just like heaven
Why
Come on, come on, collide
Let's see what a fire feels like
I bet it's just like heaven""
(Just like heaven)
(Just like heaven)

[Verse 2]
Such a shame, nowhere near even a near miss
Light years away from the hope of being sun-kissed
Anchored home in her interstellar sea
But poor lonely Cassiopeia
So she sighs, and she burns with desperation
Learns to cry over love of constellations
Then: a spark from a star shooting too close
They both smiled; what a day to explode!

[Verse 1: Sara Bareilles]
Sometimes I can be perfectly sweet
Got this sugary me all stuffed up in my sleeve
And I talk of ponies and rainbows and things
And I'm just who you want me to be
But like most creatures down here on the ground
I'm composed of the elements moving around
And I grow and change and I shift and I switch
And it turns out I'm actually kind of a bitch
But that only happens when I get provoked
By some piece of shit asshole we
All sadly know
And I sit and I write while reminding you all
That mean songs are still better than going postal

[Chorus: Sara Bareilles & Ben Folds]
And that guy's an asshole
That girl's a bitch
Baby it's natural
No gettin' away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go
Fuck that guy he's just an asshole

Your toxin wasting perfectly good space
And I say what I think
Cause it's more economic than drugs or a drink

Sugar, butter, flour

Sometimes I still see her
My mother, the dreamer
She'd say, ""Nothing's impossible, child""

A dream needs believing
To taste like the real thing
Like some stranger you recognize

So pure, so electric
So sure, so connected
To those little believers inside
May we all be so lucky

But dreams are elusive
The kind we've gotten used to is
Nothing I can feel
Nothing I can hold
Nothing I can have
Nothing that I know
Dreams come and they go

But hold them and keep them
(But hold them and keep them)
And know that you need them
(And know that you need them)
When your breaking point's all that you have
A dream is a soft place to land
May we all be so lucky

I didn't plan it
But it's finally something to feel

Look around you, ain't no saints here, baby
We're all just looking for a little less crazy
And sometimes it's a hard left turn
Down a road you never thought you'd see
And don't you think dealing blame is a hazard?

Poured my glass of wine
You caught me some fireflies
Told me their names
And how much they love their life in a jar
You twist around me like vines
You rub the stars in my bright eyes
Then you sold me a future
From the ones you had in the trunk of your car

[Pre-Chorus]
You said I think too much
You said I always mess it up
It was so easy to believe
I've always said the same things

[Chorus]
Stay out, honey, I can see you're wicked
And I don't want your wicked love
Don't need what makes me feel addicted
I don't want your wicked love
Stay out, stay out

You thought I didn't notice
You had me caught like a firefly
I'd abandoned my flight
To be crawling around with these wings
But I won't forget this moment (Wait until you see)
And how mighty the truth can be
How her hammer and nails
Chisel beauty from grotesque things

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I think too much
Tell me I always mess it up
Well, I'll break the glass and see
If the fireflies agree

Stay out, honey, I can see you're wicked

Cinderella's on her bedroom floor
She's got a crush on the guy at the liquor store
'Cause Mr. Charming don't come home anymore
And she forgets why she came here
Sleeping Beauty's in a foul mood, for shame
She says ""None for you dear prince, I'm tired today
I'd rather sleep my whole life away than have you keep me from dreaming""

[Chorus]
I don't care for your fairytales
You're so worried about the maiden
Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing
Next best thing

[Verse 2]
Snow White is doing dishes again
'Cause what else can you do with seven itty-bitty men?
Sends them to bed and she calls up a friend
Says, ""Would you meet me at midnight?""
Oh, the tall blonde lets out a cry of despair
Says, ""Would cut it myself if I knew men could climb hair
I'll have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows""

Man made up a story, said that I should believe him

My imagination hadn't turned on me yet
I used to let my words wax poetic
But it melted a puddle at my feet now
It is a calcifying crime, it's tragic
I've turned to petrified past life baggage
I want to disappear and just start over
So here we are

From on my knees, make me a Hercules

I've lost a grip on where I started from
I wish I'd thought ahead and left a few crumbs
I'm on the hunt for who I've not yet become
But I'd settle for a little equilibrium

Both sides dissatisfied and somewhat violent

For a heart worth the breaking (Heart worth the breaking)
But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of one sweet love

[Bridge]
Savor the sorrow to soften the pain
Sip on the southern rain
As I do, I don't look, don't touch, don't do anything
But hope that there is a you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The earth that is the space between
I'd banish it from under me, to get to you
Your unexpected love provides my solitary's suicide, oh
I wish I knew

[Chorus]
The time that I've taken
I pray is not wasted
Have I already tasted my piece of one sweet love?
Ready and waiting (Ready and waiting)
For a heart worth the breaking (Heart worth the breaking)
But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of one sweet love

395887,Sara Bareilles,Beautiful Girl,"8 ContributorsBeautiful Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
You wanna walk into the room like that other girl does
The one that’s always making everybody fall in love
You see - girl you’re a lot like me
She rearranges all the light in the room so you’re always in the shadows
Well that’s what it feels like to you…
Baby, I’ve been there too
And I know how much it can sometimes hurt
You feel like the whole world has made you the ugly girl
But take it from me that you have to see it first

[Chorus]
So before you trade in your summer skin for those high heeled shoes
To make him want to be with you
Let me remind you one more time
That just maybe, you’re beautiful but you just can't see
So why don’t you trust me
They’ll see it too, you beautiful girl, you

[Verse 2]
You wanna lay the blame on somebody else
All these tiny little minds that leave you up on a shelf
Well, okay, I’ve seen it done that way
But just in case nobody ever comes through
Riding in to come to your rescue
You've still a chance
You don’t have to be asked to dance
And I know how much you’ve been dying to say
""Look how much everybody loves me""
But guess who gets left when everyone else fades away

Some people long for a life that is simple and planned, tied with a ribbon
Some people won't sail the sea, 'cause they're safer on land
To follow what's written but I'd follow you to the great unknown
Off to a world we call our own

[Chorus]
Hand in my hand and we promise to never let go
We're walking the tightrope
High in the sky we can see the whole world down below
We're walking the tightrope
Never sure, never know how far we could fall

[Post-Chorus]
But it's all an adventure that comes with a breathtaking view
Walking the tightrope with you

[Verse 2]
Mountains and valleys and all that will come in between
Desert and ocean
You pulled me in and together we're lost in a dream
Always in motion
So I risk it all just to be with you
And I risk it all for this life we choose

[Chorus]
Hand in my hand and you promise to never let go
We're walking the tightrope
High in the sky we can see the whole world down below
We're walking the tightrope
Never sure, will you catch me if I should fall?

Give me a heart to hold the godlike truth
Give me one good soul that I can tell it through
Give me good reason to believe in you
And give me strength if you have time

[Verse 1]
Give me two hands that’ll hold us up
And though you give me no more than just enough
You gave a pair of brown eyes that could call a good bluff
To somebody who thinks they shine

[Chorus 1]
You, I just want you
I just want you

[Verse 2]
Spend most of my life on a microphone
Giving all that I got til I head back home
And when the lights go out, and I’m all alone
I’ve got no reason to be crying
And on a bad day I feel like a masochist
Take it away from me if it’s for the best
Somehow I’ve ended up the head of this
Freight train that isn’t mine

But at the end of the day
The only words I’ll say
Is “I just want you”

Ooooh, mmmm, mmmm

[Verse 3]
It’s all so simple when you break it all down
Two roads converged on a hallowed ground
It’s taken all my life to hear the sacred sound
Of sweet simplicity
Saying “Give it all back, it don’t mean a thing”
You got a short-lived life and a song to sing
And the only way up is believing
And never looking down
[Chorus 2]
So take it all away
If it isn’t meant for me
I don’t want the easy way
I just want you
They can give me everything
But at the end of the day
The only words I’ll say
Is “I just want you”

Let me paint a picture for you
Then I'll have to teach you to see it
Illustrate the remnants of the life
I used to live here in Eden
Rolled a lucky pair of dice, ended up in paradise
Landed on a snake's eyes
Took a bite, and ended up bleedin'

I think I would start with the name
The truth is, all those angels started acting the same
And I know there's no going back now

It doesn't disappear just because you say it isn't there
So when they ask, ""Why'd she go?""

[Verse 2]
Walking in the garden
Was a serpent-shaped heart and he told me
That what is broken cannot show
And less than beautiful is worse than unholy
Idolized my innocence, stole it from me in the end
Now I'm wide awakened
And still paying for the poison they sold me

Open up my heart and break her
No gentle waters, no anchor
I'm barely brave enough to keep breathing
But I believe in love

Do you know what you fight for

On broken branches and life lines

More winding off the road

I could use another cigarette
But don't worry daddy, I'm not addicted yet
One too many drinks tonight and I miss you
Like you were mine
All your stormy words have barely broken
And you sound like thunder though
You've barely spoken
Oh, it looks like rain tonight and thank God
Because a clear sky just wouldn't feel right

[Chorus]
He's taken and leaving
But I keep believing
That he's gonna come round soon
(He'll come round soon I know)

[Verse 2]
You may be my final match
Because I chase everything when you play
Throw and I play catch
It never took much to keep me satisfied
But all the bullshit you feed me you miss me
You need me
This hungry heart will not subside

Well I may seem naive if I cry as you leave
Like I'm just one more tortured heart
These cracks that I show as I'm watching
You go aren't tearing me apart
I may seem naive if I cry as you leave
Like I'm just one more tortured heart
These cracks that I show as I'm watching

Well who needs angels anyway?

There's a harvest each Saturday night
At the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride
A place you can stand for one night and get gone
It's clear this conversation ain't doing a thing
Because these boys only listen to me when I sing
And I don't feel like singing tonight

I'm finding every reason to be gone
Nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?

You got your wolves in their clothes whispering Hollywood's name
Stealing gold from the silver they see
But it's not me

Not a trace of the sun, but I don't even run from rain
Beating out of my chest, my heart is holding on to you

Such a beautiful mess intertwined and overrun
Nothing better than this
Ooh, and then the storm can come
You feel just like the sun
Just like the sun

Opaque but electric
The ways you're connected
Are invisible threads from your eyes
May we all be so lucky

It swells up between you
In its magnetic magnitude

A brute force with the sweetest disguise
It swallows the days and makes everything else simply fade away
It's the fireworks when two souls collide

It's everything I am and what I'm not
And all I'm tryna be
This is the part where I spit it all out
And you decide what you think of me
I'm not trying to be complicated
I'm never waiting to get the last laugh
But I've been handing out benefits of the doubt
And I'd like a little bit back

And if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest things
It's just my little voice that I've been missing

Looking over the precious moments, it hurts, don't it?
They can cut both ways
No amount of remembering the better things will make the bad ones go away
But I've been broken and the one to blame
So my savior of self-defense, taught me to sing what I can't say

I'm afraid of heights, afraid of tryin'
And I'm afraid I might have been a little stupid to write this song
I'm afraid that during high winds
The stop sign will uproot and decapitate me
Or that I might thrive under Scientology
I'm afraid that after I die
Someone will have sex with my dead body
And be like, ""Not worth it""
I'm afraid I could raise a son who'd get radicalized on Reddit
Or that he'll Back to the Future, and I'll think he's hot
And I'm afraid that I'll accidentally text a pic of my vagina to my dad
And I'm afraid that on Ancestry.com
I might find out I have a bunch of half siblings
And they'll want to be in my life
I'm afraid that if I got an awful disease, I wouldn't be brave
I'd just be a bitch and be mean or if I needеd emergency hеart surgery
The doctor would go, ""Hello nipple hair""
Sometimes I'm afraid to hold a new baby
What if I lose control of my arms for a second?
And throw it at the ceiling fan or something like that
Can't I trust my arms?

[Verse 2]
And I'm afraid, that under every bus stop is a sinkhole of rats
And I'm afraid, they lie about expiration dates and my hummus is fungus
And afraid that the second I leave town, I'll get a UTI
Why can't they just sell those pills over the counter?
I don't need a doctor

I only breastfed for four months, is he gonna be a bond trader?
And I'm afraid that if I'm lucky enough to be 80

And I'm afraid that someone will find out that I memorized all the words to Macklemore's ""Thrift Shop""
Or that I bought seven seasons of The Mentalist

And my family worked until the job was done
We didn't have much but we still had some
And I learned to be happy enough

I'm proud of everything I've earned and own
I built a business and I built a home
Someday you'll read it on my slate headstone
That I was happy enough

Keep your head down
And enjoy what's around you
Make solid ground on happy enough
The way that I see it
I have what I need
As long as I breathe, I'm happy enough

I get by on happy enough
I get by on happy enough (I get by)
(Happy enough)

I know you mean it and I envy that
I wish I felt that way too
But you've got a house, your health, a job, a husband
Girl, what else do you want?
We can't have it all
(Ooh, happy enough)

Why you don't adore me?

In how I might be cursed

All of your time just to hate me
Every dime gone to ways
You can find that might bait me
And drag me down, sight set proudly

Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
Will you try it once?

Beyond the yellow brick road

I bet they shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics

392365,Sara Bareilles,Not Alone,"3 ContributorsNot Alone Lyrics[Intro]
It comes calling in the evening
When the temperature is dropping out
They said it don't get cold here
But I beg to differ now

[Verse 1]
There is something in the shadows
More than sister silhouette
Something sinister and strange
That I haven't seen yet

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want to be alone
Sky, don't let the sun go
I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

[Chorus]
And I don't want to cry when you go
Stay a little longer, you know
You're making me feel
I'm not alone

[Verse 2]
You don't have to fight the bad guys
Throwing punches out into the black
If you have to tell me lies, I don't care
Just give me some good back

[Verse 3]
And if I only worry about it
Worry about it, worry about it
I just keep breaking down
Breaking down, breaking down
Boy, I could do without
Do without, do without
A night of the bad dreams, sad things
Tell me what that means

If the ghost light is burning
We'll invite something in
Let the dark free her secrets

Let her borrow my voice now
What if darkness could sing?

I could shine so you would see me
But all I've ever been is the absence of the light
I don't shine, no one sees me
So won't you, you, you?
Won't you, you, you?
Won't you, you, you?
Won't you, you, you?

So the darkness could speak?
If the veil could be lifted
What if shadows were seen?
Could they offer their wisdom?
Would they feel some relief?
Let them borrow my voice now

Tell her I fall asleep when we watch TV
And it drives you crazy having to rewind the scenes
But you do for me

Tell her my temper has a strong grip

Tell her we laugh a lot, and I've seen you cry
And it isn't lost on me she's the reason why
Tell her all about it

While you're at it, tell yourself thе same thing

But I just need to hear I'm the one again
So, if you don't want to see me leave, could you please–

[Verse 1]
It's a feeling
My hands and feet held to the floor
Like I'm kneeling
Prostrate to what fate sent through
Holding down the only solid ground I can find
'Cause I don't wanna try the other kind
I don't have it yet, a good sense of
Knowing when what I do should be immediate
But all this waiting for a sign from the other side
For fuck's sake, this is just a timeline
Just a timeline

Sara, stop it
Pick at your paralysis
And unlock it
And flex the fear 'til it builds you a rocket and rise
And if you fall at least you end up between
Where you will be and where you will have been

What was that?

(sung)
Was that me?
Was that him?
Did a prince really kiss me?
And kiss me?
And kiss me?
And did I kiss him back?

Was it wrong?
Am I mad?
Is that all?
Does he miss me?
Was he suddenly
Getting bored with me?

Wake up! Stop dreaming
Stop prancing about the woods
It's not beseeming
What is it about the woods?

Back to life, back to sense
Back to child, back to husband
No one lives in the woods
There are vows, there are ties
There are needs, there are standards
There are shouldn'ts and shoulds
See Sara Bareilles LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also likeWhy not both instead?
There's the answer, if you're clever
Have a child for warmth
And a baker for bread
And a prince for whatever—
Never!
It's these woods

Face the facts, find the boy
Join the group, stop the giant
Just get out of the woods
Was that him? Yes, it was
Was that me? No, it wasn't
Just a trick of the woods

Just a moment
One peculiar passing moment—

Must it all be either less or more
Either plain or grand?
Is it always ""or""?
Is it never ""and""?
That's what woods are for
For those moments in the woods

Oh, if life were made of moments
Even now and then a bad one—!
But if life were only moments
Then you'd never know you had one
First a witch, then a child
Then a prince, then a moment—
Who could live in the woods?
And to get what you wish
Only just for a moment—
These are dangerous woods...

Let the moment go
Don't forget it for a moment, though
Just remembering you've had an ""and""
When you're back to ""or""
Makes the ""or"" mean more
Than it did before
Now I understand—
And it's time to leave the woods!Embed",0,/songs/8429294,Moments In The Woods by Sara Bareilles,https://images.genius.com/d2241c7bd0eae41dce51579559478fd0.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/d2241c7bd0eae41dce51579559478fd0.640x640x1.jpg,13517274,complete,/Sara-bareilles-moments-in-the-woods-lyrics,,https://images.genius.com/d2241c7bd0eae41dce51579559478fd0.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/d2241c7bd0eae41dce51579559478fd0.640x640x1.jpg,Moments In The Woods,https://genius.com/Sara-bareilles-moments-in-the-woods-lyrics,/albums/955524,https://images.genius.com/d2241c7bd0eae41dce51579559478fd0.640x640x1.jpg,Into the Woods (2022 Broadway Cast Recording) by Into the Woods 2022 Broadway Cast,955524.0,Into the Woods (2022 Broadway Cast Recording),"September 30, 2022",https://genius.com/albums/Into-the-woods-2022-broadway-cast/Into-the-woods-2022-broadway-cast-recording

Oh, honey, don't you cry
The absence of the light
Even the sun must rest his weary eyes
So let the night wrap stars around you
Weigh the anchor, and sail into the night's joy
You can be king of the lost boys

[Chorus]
Come, now
Honey, don't you cry, no
Honey, don't you cry
In time you will be stronger
Don't you worry 'bout the why
Those answers come in time
So leave your heart to wander
Leave your heart to wander, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Don't, don't cry (Don't, don't)
Don't, don't cry (Don't, don't)
Don't, don't cry (Don't, don't)
Don't, don't cry (Don't, don't cry)

[Verse 2]
Shadows begin their game
These facеs with no names
Whisper words in tongues
Makе your ears ring
The monsters circle 'round, eyes upon you
Raise your head, and let them hear your heart's choice
You are the king of the lost boys

I don’t care if the house is packed
Or the strings of light are broken
I don’t care if the gifts are wrapped
Or there’s nothing here to open

[Verse 1]
Love is not a toy, and no paper will conceal it
Love is simply joy that I’m home
I don’t care if the carpet's stained; we've got food upon our table
I don’t care if it’s going to rain, our little room is warm and stable
Love is who we are, and no season can contain it
Love would never fall for that

[Pre-Chorus]
We sing oooooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooooooooooooo

[Chorus]
Let love lead us, love is Christmas

[Verse 2]
Why so scared that you’ll mess it up? When perfection keeps you haunted
All we need is your best my love, that’s all anyone ever wanted
Love is how we do, let no judgment overrule it
Love I look to you, and I sing

Closed my eyes to see

To write is just to bleed

The ugliness I've seen
Until I change the truth, rearrange the letters
For beauty underneath

But it will take what it will take

But if you live deep and love strong
You get pretty damn close

So many ways to slice a piece of this life
But most of the time it's in the quarter-life crisis
What’s on your plate at any given time
Can change with the specials and a jukebox dime

Down at the diner

[JENNA]
Start to feel a little lighter

[ALL]
Yeah, down at the diner
Look around and feel better
We're all in this together

[BECKY]
I wouldn't call this place a happy end
But I been ’round the block and just came back again
Ain't seen the world yet, but I know this much
Might as well call home wherever my ass ends up

But I've found myself organizing condiments

I’m exp’nentially wiser

The people in places that save us and serve as reminder

It's everything I am and what I'm not
And all I'm tryna be
This is the part where I spit it all out
And you decide what you think of me
I'm not trying to be complicated
I'm never waiting to get the last laugh
But I've been handing out benefits of the doubt
And I'd like a little bit back

[Chorus]
It's just a little voice
And if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest things
It's just my little voice that I've been missing

[Verse 2]
Looking over the precious moments, it hurts, don't it?
They can cut both ways
No amount of remembering thе better things will make thе bad ones go away
But I've been broken and the one to blame
So my savior of self-defense, taught me to sing what I can't say

[Chorus]
It's just a little voice
And if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice

Can't tell you the truth

Comes when you lie right back
Safe from such a strange point of view
To hear your own words on you

You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in
Don't want to come down too low
Any way the wind blows

Similar creatures, we are
Chasing the pipe dream down
Love elusive so far
Keeps us divided now
Go, go on and write me love songs
So I've something to sing when you're gone

If I build it out of blood and bone
If I love it and I even give it a good name
And I let it stand up on it's own
And if I even ever learn to trust and walk away
Will it crumble on it's own two feet?
Or will it multiply and grow big, white wings?
If I love it and I give it life
Can I let it go and know that it was never mine?

[Chorus]
Give more
Give it all away
I'm sure it'll come back someday
You gotta let go to let it circle back around
To rise up, you gotta learn to root down
Learn to root down
Hey, ah
Learn to root down
Oh, ah

[Verse 2]
If I cut it with a heart-shaped knife
And I send it to my very closest of friends
And they somehow bring it back to life
What if I only ever do it all over again?
I'm a writer here upon this ship
On a sea of unnamed and untamed passages
And every vessel's meant for pouring out
And every bloom has to make room to root down

But his arms are angels by his side
You need not ask if they're open, just how wide

Ooh, and with our love we conjure up twilight
His fingers are music to my soul
And I feel his song play everywhere I go

It's for you, little lady
Is it all that you dreamed of?
Oh, if I knew what had been there waiting
I'd have screamed out and jumped up

Now here I am
With my feet on the sand
And a body that won't move
The tide's coming in
And I'm bound for a swim
In a pair of cement shoes

He takes what he can, what he wants
Doesn't matter if it's ever been given
I took the bait and a chance on a man
Sold by the boy that he lived in

And I was wrong to believe that strength makes you strong
And I had hope in a change I would see in us both
And now I'm heavy
He lifts me, but never once carried
Door number two, I've already walked through

Ask me the question:
Who coulda guessed I would be here at this crossroad?
Plain to be seen that it's all up to me
I'm no longer alone, though
See Sara Bareilles LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also likeAnd nothing's changed
And I see it more every day
Nothing moves
It's a game to be played and to lose

And now I'm heavy, unsteady
But maybe I'm getting ready
And this might catch fire and char this ground

I might lift this up to only be the one
Who's gonna get let down
Will I be enough to get this on its way
To find some higher ground?
Before the waters rush, I've got to make a change
Or else I know I'll drown

Have taken more than I gave them

I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine

It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
And you're not what I asked for

For a chance to start over and rewrite an ending or two

Down the same road for days
I've seen the coastline
Going both ways
Some days are perfect
And some simply could not get worse
Some days it's all worth it
And some days this life is nothing but a curse
And I wonder who will break first

[Chorus]
I am small
I feel like no more than nothing at all
But when I lose sight of daylight
And my darkness falls
I'll be strong
And if not now it won't be long
From when I lose sight of daylight
And my hands are weak
And my soul is tired
Oh, I'll give my love from the inside out
From the inside out

Now don't you desert me now

The angels said I'd smile today
Well who needs angels anyway?
Hey-ey, yeah
He's taken and leaving
I keep believing
He's gonna come round soon
Until I see him again
I'm staying believing
That it won't be deceiving
When he's going to come round

[Verse 1]
I could use another cigarette
But don't worry daddy, I'm not addicted yet
One too many drinks tonight and I miss you
Like you were mine
All your stormy words have barely broken
And you sound like thunder though
You've barely spoken
Oh, it looks like rain tonight and thank God
'Cause a clear sky just wouldn't feel right

[Chorus]
He's taken and leaving
But I keep believing
That he's gonna come round soon
Until I see him again
I'm staying believing
That it won't be deceiving
When he's gonna come round soon

You may be my final match
Because I chase everything when you play
Throw and I play catch
Never took much to keep me satisfied
But all this bullshit you feed me, you miss me
You need me
This hungry heart will not subside

[Chorus]
He's taken and leaving
But I keep believing
That he's gonna come round soon
Until I see him again
I'm staying believing
That it won't be deceiving
When he's gonna come round soon

[Verse 3]
I may seem naive if I cry as you leave
Like I'm just one more tortured heart
But baby, don't be fooled
Cause these cracks that I show as I'm watching
You go aren't tearing me apart
Cause I know I'll see you soon
The angels said I'd smile today
Oh, well who needs angels anyway?
Hey-ey, yeah
[Chorus]
He's taken and leaving
I keep believing
That he's gonna come round soon
(He's gonna come round home)
Til I see him again
I'm staying believing
That it won't be deceiving
When he's going come round soon
He's taken and leaving

He's gonna come round soon
Til I see him again

That it won't be deceiving
That he's gonna come round soon

Babe, will you save me a dance by the river
Moonlight is serving us well
She makes the whole world silhouette
Makes it flicker like film on a strip
Don’t let the sadness in yet to react as if
Somehow it’s all come and gone
Let’s pretend we’re all healed up and happy and moved on

[Chorus]
Tonight let the moon come shine
Let us remain you and I
Tell the sun not to rise
For the darkest time
Moonlight keep us steady
Give me one more night then I’m ready
To let go, to know we are only shadows

[Verse 2]
Babe, I’m so sorry to ask
I’m ashamed but tonight I just can’t give you up
I shackled myself to the past and my will has gone missing
Let’s call our shadow selves out for the evening
And watch them remember our love
Tomorrow will come and I know they’ll be leaving
That our time is up

Unfolding all the pleasures of the dark?

You can color me, colour me, colour me, colour me in grey
So I'm working on the words I want to say
I never knew, never knew, never knew your name
You're just my soldier, babe
You lost track of the days
They come and they go, and they come and they go
There's no way that I could keep up with it
And I pray
And I wonder, wonder, wonder if you hear me
Ten thousand miles away

I'm missing your life
Wish I could hold you
And make it alright

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out

And done some disappearing

Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

Hard enough to get out, much less get away

Got your claws in my mane, as if I need help

Hear what I heard you say

Wear it if you can, take it like a man
Remember your place
Get your diamond ring, don’t say a thing
A lady has grace

This is my winter song to you
The storm is coming soon
It rolls in from the sea
My voice, a beacon in the night
My words will be your light
To carry you to me
Is love alive?
Is love alive?

They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow
Or so I have been told
They say we're buried far
Just like a distant star
I simply cannot hold

Cause you're not where you belong

The seasons always change
And life will find a way
I'll be your harvester of light
And send it out tonight
So we can start again

You remind me of a girl I once knew
Gah, by now she’s well in middle age
She’s probably 41, or 42

[JENNA, spoken]
Thank you?

[DR. POMATTER, spoken]
Oh god, no, no, what I meant was that —
(sung)
She was a waitress at a shop I used to frequent quite a lot
Nice teeth and small hands and snuck me goodies I couldn’t afford then
She was sweet to me
Reminds me of you

[JENNA, spoken]
Nobody ever really notices me that way

[DR. POMATTER, spoken]
She’d make the pies fresh every day
Like you, I guess but I must say
If pies were books yours would be Shakеspeare’s lettеrs
You remind me of her, but better

It only takes a taste
When it’s something special
It only takes a taste
When ya know it’s good
Sometimes one bite is more than enough
To know you want more of the thing you just got a taste of
See Sara Bareilles LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also like[JENNA]
That reminds me of a thing we would say
Me and my momma in the kitchen when we’d bake
She’d say Jenna, you can tell a whole story with a taste

[DR. POMATTER]
Yeah! Yeah that’s exactly what I mean
I swear that as those flavors mixed and melted I could hear the sirens sing
It was truly something special — one taste and I want the whole thing

I must say
It felt like I was carried away
Intoxicated, made me escape the room I was in
I can’t help but wonder how your hands must have felt
Creating such a masterful thing

[JENNA]
Just one bite
Caused all that wondering

So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by
You've got opinions, man, we're all entitled to them
But I never asked
So, let me thank you for your time and try to not waste any more of mine
And get out of here fast

But I'm not drowning, there's no one here to save

You're so busy making maps with my name on them in all caps

You claim your innocence
And I blame your reticence
For why, I never knew no, never knew how you play
One love has two equal parts
You leave your love with your mark on your unfortunate prey
But there is no excuse
I don't like being used
Someday it's gonna get back to you, oh

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable man
You hit the ground and you ran
Ran as if I, if I would chase you
But your dear delectable prize
Beneath your near electrical skies
Is damn near disappointment at most
I didn't know I paid for merely a masquerade
So I want my money back, hey

[Chorus]
'Cause you're sorry that you hurt me so bad
Sorry if I thought you were madly in love
You only just pretend to start something that you can end

Look how you're standing there
There with your hands out
Standing next to the road that goes up
Running your mouth about how you're going to wait
For the one that comes down
Who do you think you are? Somebody's baby?
You want what everyone has, but you want your name on it
Think it happens like that? That'd be nice wouldn't it?
I've got to be careful of you
I want to get there, too

[Chorus]
You want to go, but you want a free ride
You want an in by standing on the outside
I'm not the one to call when it comes undone
You want the world, but don't want to pay out
Don't want to hurt, and don't want to say out loud that I'm right
There's no end in sight waiting on a free ride

[Verse 2]
You said your turn is coming
That's what you told me
And so you stand in one place
Wait for the tunnel to come light up your face
And reward you for what you haven't done
And I know it's out of my hands
But I had to pay with blood, sweat, and tears
While you dare to say that your lucky day's past due

Don't want to hurt, and don't want to say out loud that I'm right
There's no end in sight waiting on a free ride

[Verse 3]
I see you when the lights rise up
You want some, too
How could anyone blame you?
I see you when the lights rise up
You want some, too
How could anyone blame you?
You want to go, but you want a free ride
You want to go, but you want a free ride

Every word, every touch
Every look is a little too much
I'm helpless now to the arms of this stranger
Haunting smiles, one by one
Creep inside, and it's over and done
I've lost control, but without feeling danger

[Chorus]
Does he know
How it feels to be dying inside?
To let go
How it feels to be wondering
If he would say no?
How it feels, oh, my everyday stranger

[Verse 2]
Playing games in my mind
Say that I know one of his kind
I'll wrap him up in a blanket of goodbyes
Then a turn for the worst
He looks up, and I'm already cursed
Tangled up, and it's harder to disguise

[Chorus]

To keep from dreaming of you
Unless you wanted me to
But that's something I may never know, no, oh

To make it easier to walk away
Unless you asked me to say
But the only way I'll survive is if I go

Cinderella's on her bedroom floor
She's got a crush on the guy at the liquor store
'Cause Mr. Charming don't come home anymore
And she forgets why she came here
Sleeping Beauty's in a foul mood, for shame
She says ""None for you dear prince, I'm tired today
I'd rather sleep my whole life away than have you keep me from dreaming""

[Chorus]
I don't care for your fairytales
You're so worried about the maiden
Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing
Next best thing, yeah

[Verse 2]
Snow White is doing dishes again
'Cause what else could you do with seven itty-bitty men?
Sends them to bed and she calls up a friend
Says, ""Would you meet me at midnight?""
Oh, the tall blonde lets out a cry of despair
Says, ""Would cut it myself if I knew men could climb hair
I'll have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows""

Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain

Should be saying that to you by now, shouldn't I?
Laying down a law that I live by
Well, maybe next time

I've got a thick tongue
Brimming with the words that go unsung
I simmer, then I burn for a someone, the wrong one
And I tell myself to let the story end
My heart will rest in someone else's hand
My 'why not me?' philosophy began
And I say

[Chorus]
Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
Someday
Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight

Keep me when I'm hurting, you make me
Hang from your hands
Well, no more
I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door
If I'm aching at the thought of you, what for?
It's not me anymore

He had a Queen with a castle worth coming in
Everyone said so but he’s no good at listening

It was one day and queenie’s in a land far away
And the good ol’ King Restless is aching to play
With the next best thing and the girl after that

I feel you, it's like you're in the next room
At any given moment, you could reappear
Thin air, you're out there in it somewhere
If I could only get there, I could breathe again

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how to start
What comes after you?
I am in the dark
Love what now?

[Chorus]
No such thing as over you
I don't want it anyway
I wouldn't even try to
If I don't let go, then there is
No such thing as over this
I've tried to get over you, over you, over you
But I think there's no such thing

[Verse 2]
Broken, you're Rome, I am the ruins
The stone I can't find you in is all that still remains

[Pre-Chorus]
Little white lights
They perforate every night sky
I say it to them every time
""Come back in""

You're on my mind, all the time
But I can't fix it by fixating on a rewind

When a good thing changes
When the change is staying
Only thing to find is
What to hold on 'til there's something else to hold on to
(Over you, over you, over you)
Hold on, 'til there's something else to hold on to

No words, my tears won't make any room for more
And it don't hurt like anything I've ever felt before
This is no broken heart, no familiar scars
This territory goes uncharted
Just me, in a room sunk down in a house in a town
And I don't breathe, no I never meant to let it get away from me
Now I've too much to hold
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
And I want uncharted
I'm stuck under the ceiling I made
I can't help but feeling

[Chorus]
I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out of foolproof ideas
So don't ask me how to get started
It's all uncharted

[Turnaround]
La-la-la, la-da-da

[Verse 2]
Each day, counting up the minutes till I get alone
Because I can't stay in the middle of it all, it's nobody's fault
But I'm so low, never knew how much I didn't know
Oh, everything is uncharted

Jump start your kaleidoscope heart
Love to watch the colors fade
They may not make sense
But they sure as hell made me
I won't go as a passenger, no
Waiting for the road to be laid
Though I may be going down
I'm taking flame over burning out
Compare where you are to where you want to be, and you'll get nowhere

[Chorus]
I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go

You can have Manhattan

And leave them on your doorstep
I’ll tip toe away
So you won’t have to say

The bustle and the buildings
The weather in the fall
And I’ll bow out of place
To save you some space
For somebody new

You can have Manhattan
'Cause I can’t have you
O-o-oh

The one where we were laughing
And drunk on just being there
Hang onto the reverie

And sunsets facing westward
With sand beneath my feet

I made up my mind when I was a young girl
I've been given this one world, I won't worry away, no

Many the miles but send me the miles
And I'll be happy to follow you, love
I do what I can wherever I end up
To keep giving my good love and spreading it around
'Cause I've had my fair share of take care and goodbyes

Hi
It's my birthday
It's your birthday? Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
How old are you? Don't tell me, just kidding, we don't do that, we don't do that, we're women, we don't do anything

You're going to be staring at my backside tonight, you're welcome in advance, thank you

Get down to the heart of it
No it's my heart you're shit out of your luck
Don't make me tell you again my love love love love

I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts
With her delicate soul
I don't claim to know much except soon as you start
To make room for the parts
That aren't you it gets harder to bloom in a garden of

Worth trying to be and it's

I do it for love

We can understand the sentiment you're saying to us
Oh, but sensible sells so could you kindly shut up
And get started
At keeping your part of the bargain aw please
Little darlin'
You're killing me sweetly with love love love love
Love love love love
Only thing I ever could need only one good thing
Worth trying to be
And its love, love
Love, love
I do it for love
Love, love

Started as a flicker meant to be a flame
Skin has gotten thicker but it burns the same
Still a baby in a cradle got to take my first fall
Baby's getting next to nowhere
With her baack against the wall
You meant to make me happy make me sad
Want to make it better better so bad
But save your resolutions for your never new year
There is only one solution I can see here
Love you're all I ever could need only one good thing
Worth trying to be and it's
Love, love
Love, love
I do it for love, love, love, love
Oh, only gonna get, get what you give away

We found a tender love it blossomed wild and free
Pure proof was in your arms when you were kissing me
I was an open book, you were an ocean breeze
Rustling through pages I never should have let you see
Never should have let you see

Was I so wrong being such an open book?
Trusting so soon, losing all the tender time it took to love you
Just to crawl away with broken wings
And the pieces of my heart still splintering
The pieces of my heart still splintering

Friend’s asking where you are, say I misunderstood
I say he’s gone away, but he’s not gone for good
Speak of romantic plans we’re looking forward to
Meanwhile, imagining you end up with someone new

This ocean full of tears that I’m about to cry

Most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them

It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but shе's kind
She is lonely most of the timе
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine

It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life

If I'm honest, I know
I would give it all back for
A chance to start over
Rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

Who'll be reckless, just enough
Who'll get hurt
But who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used
By a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Used to be mine

She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie

At the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride
A place you can stand for one night and get gone
And it's clear, this conversation ain't doing a thing
'Cause these boys only listen to me when I sing
And I don't feel like singing tonight all the same songs
Here in these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
There's nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?
The situation's always the same
You got your wolves in their clothes
Whispering Hollywood's name
Stealing gold from the silver they see
But it's not me
Here in these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
There's nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?
Calling out, somebody save me
I feel like I'm fading away, am I gone?
Calling out, somebody save me
I feel like I'm fading
No, no, no

A one, a two

[Verse 1]
Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you havе is leavin', I'ma need a better rеason

I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart
Sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You're not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

[Pre-Chorus]
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one

To write you a love song today

[Bridge]
Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say
[Chorus]
I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this, no
Is that why you wanted a love song?
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you a love song today
Oh yeah

[Spoken Outro]
You sound amazing LA
I wanna introduce you to a wonderful friend of mine
An incredible asset to the band
He's on the heartbeat, this is Mr. Charley Drayton on the drums
Hey buddy
Um, so, as, as you've already experienced, we're gonna
Do some new songs, we're gonna do some old songs, um
This is another song off the new record and
This was written, the seeds of this song were written, um
After I returned home from the women's march and
Did you march LA?
Man, I was um, I was profoundly changed by that experience, um
My actual sister and my chosen sisters, some of my best friends
We made the pilgrimage
Some of them are here tonight that I marched with
Woo, I hear you somewhere
Um, and we made the pilgrimage to Washington D.C
And we crowded in a hotel room
And we marched on the mall with hundreds of thousands of people
And I have never felt safer or more seen and heard in my entire life
It was so powerful to lend your, your time and energy to something
Um, bigger and more important than just you and it was so beautiful and, um
So I, I really started thinking about
The fact that we're alive at this time
Where there's this incredible shift in consciousness about what it means to be a woman
And what it means to sort of
Disassemble and, and reanalyze some things that have always just been sort of
Social constructs and they're just, they just are but they don't have to be
And so to be alive at a time where we get to make these choices consciously is
Super fucking important to me and I am so proud to be a feminist
And I am so proud
That I also love the men in my life and that I'm surrounded by an incredible community of, of
Men and women who lift each other up
So um, this one goes out to
To all my sisters and all our friendsEmbed",0,/songs/6754576,Love Song (Live from the Hollywood Bowl) by Sara Bareilles,https://images.genius.com/3588f3a77eb9d860c19c39ab4fbb1661.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/3588f3a77eb9d860c19c39ab4fbb1661.1000x1000x1.jpg,7650027,complete,/Sara-bareilles-love-song-live-from-the-hollywood-bowl-lyrics,,https://images.genius.com/3588f3a77eb9d860c19c39ab4fbb1661.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/3588f3a77eb9d860c19c39ab4fbb1661.1000x1000x1.jpg,Love Song (Live from the Hollywood Bowl),https://genius.com/Sara-bareilles-love-song-live-from-the-hollywood-bowl-lyrics,/albums/763913,https://images.genius.com/3588f3a77eb9d860c19c39ab4fbb1661.1000x1000x1.jpg,Amidst the Chaos: Live from the Hollywood Bowl by Sara Bareilles,763913.0,Amidst the Chaos: Live from the Hollywood Bowl,"May 21, 2021",https://genius.com/albums/Sara-bareilles/Amidst-the-chaos-live-from-the-hollywood-bowl

Holy shit we're at the Hollywood Bowl
Goodnight, goodbye, gotta go
Just kidding, I just got here
I'm so glad you're here
Thank you for coming

[Verse 1]
By the time you hear this, I'll be in the rearview mirror
I'll even wear that green dress you like, so when I disappear
You can turn around, one last look at the girl you lost
In the time you took to make up your mind between two roads
Go and take some more time, but me and mine must go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to wait it out, no more
I can't find the man I was waiting for

[Chorus]
I wanted to be your girl in a white T-shirt
Over coffee, stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
I wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin
Stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
(While you read me poetry by dead men)

By the time you hear this, who knows where I might be?
Singin' 'bout another near-miss love that ended incomplete
I was ready, but you weren't
So jump with your net from this bridge you've burned
I wanted to tell you things, all the secrets I've been keepin'
I saw it in front of me, but then you just kept disappearin'

[Pre-Chorus]
A good dream, almost
Now I tell your ghost

I wanted to be your girl in a white T-shirt

While you read me poetry by dead men

While you read me poetry by dead men
(While you read me poetry by dead men)
While you read me poetry by dead men

[Bridge]
Line after line, the words just left to remind
The two of us, oh, what we could have been
Poetry by dead men
Fire from embers, how can I make you remember?
With a turn of a phrase, would you turn to me if I say
""I still want to be your girl?""
[Chorus]
I still wanna be your girl in a white T-shirt
Over coffee, stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry by dead men
I wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin
Stirrin' in the cinnamon
While you read me poetry
(While you read me poetry by dead men)
While you read me poetry

Thank you!
Alright, goodnight
That's gonna be my thing tonight I reckon, I can already feel it, I'm just gonna keep pretending like I'm leaving
Then it's gonna be like 11:30, and you guys are gonna be like ""is she gonna fucking leave? We would love that, parking is hard""

I'd rather sleep my whole life away
Than have you keep me from dreaming

'Cause I don't care for your fairytales
You're so worried 'bout the maiden though
You know she's only waiting on the next best thing (next best thing)

Snow White is doing dishes again 'cause
What else could you do with seven itty-bitty men?
Sends them to bed and she calls up a friend
Says ""Would you meet me at midnight?""
The tall blonde lets out a cry of despair says
""Would have cut it myself if I knew men could climb hair""
I'll have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows

'Cause I don't care for your fairytales
You're so worried 'bout the maiden though
You know she's only waiting on the next best thing (next best thing)

Once upon a time in a faraway kingdom
Man made up a story said that I should believe him
Go and tell your white knight that he's handsome in hindsight
But I don't want the next best thing
So I sing, I hold my head down and I break these walls 'round me
Can't take no more of your fairytale love

You're so worried 'bout the maiden though you know she's only waiting
On the next best thing
I don't care
I don't care
Worried 'bout the maiden though you know she's only waiting
Spent her whole life being graded on the sanctity of patience
And a dumb appreciation
But the story needs some mending and a better happy ending
Cause I don't want the next best thing
No no I don't want the next best thingEmbed",1,/songs/1935198,Fairytale - live at the fillmore version by Sara Bareilles,https://images.genius.com/f9a40985079786f655a77d276f5bfde6.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/f9a40985079786f655a77d276f5bfde6.600x600x1.jpg,1549345,complete,/Sara-bareilles-fairytale-live-at-the-fillmore-version-lyrics,,https://images.genius.com/f9a40985079786f655a77d276f5bfde6.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/f9a40985079786f655a77d276f5bfde6.600x600x1.jpg,Fairytale - live at the fillmore version,https://genius.com/Sara-bareilles-fairytale-live-at-the-fillmore-version-lyrics,/albums/338837,https://images.genius.com/f9a40985079786f655a77d276f5bfde6.600x600x1.jpg,Between the Lines: Sara Bareilles Live At The Fillmore by Sara Bareilles,338837.0,Between the Lines: Sara Bareilles Live At The Fillmore,"October 28, 2008",https://genius.com/albums/Sara-bareilles/Between-the-lines-sara-bareilles-live-at-the-fillmore
8652674,Sara Bareilles,One Sweet Love (Original Version),"2 ContributorsOne Sweet Love (Original Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just about the time the shadows call
I undress my mind and dare you to follow
Paint a portrait of my mystery
Only close my eyes and you are here with me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A nameless face to think I see
And sit and watch the waves with me 'til they're gone
A heart I'd swear I'd recognize is made out of my own devices
Could I be wrong?

[Chorus]
The time that I've taken (Time that I've taken)
I pray is not wasted (Pray is not wasted)
Have I already tasted my piеce of one sweet love?

[Verse 2]
Sleeplеss nights, you creep inside of me
Paint your shadows on the breath that we share
You take more than just my sanity
You take my reason not to care

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No ordinary wings I'll need
The sky itself will carry me back to you
The things I dream that I can do
I'd open up the moon for you
Just come down soon

The time that I've taken (Time that I've taken)
I pray is not wasted (Pray is not wasted)
Have I already tasted my piece of one sweet love?
Ready and waiting (Ready and waiting)
For a heart worth the breaking (A heart worth the breaking)
But I'd settle for an honest mistake in
The name of one sweet love

[Bridge]
Savor the sorrow to soften the pain
Sip on the southern rain
As I do, I don't look, don't touch, don't do anything
But hope that there is a you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The earth that is the space between
I'd banish it from under me, to get to you
Your unexpected love provides my solitary's suicide, oh
I wish I knew

[Chorus]
The time that I've taken (Time that I've taken)
I pray is not wasted (Pray is not wasted)
Have I already tasted my piece of one sweet love?
Ready and waiting (Ready and waiting)
For a heart worth the breaking (A heart worth the breaking)

There's a harvest each Saturday night
At the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride
A place you can stand for one night and get gone
And It's clear this conversation ain't doing a thing
'Cause these boys only listen to me when I sing
And I don't feel like singing tonight
All the same songs

[Chorus]
Here in these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
There's nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?

[Verse 2]
The situation's always the same
You got your wolves in thеir clothes whispering Hollywood's name
Stеaling gold from the silver they see
But it's not me

[Chorus]
Here in these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
There's nothing here to hold on to

[Verse 1]
We met on a rainy evening in the summertime
Don't think I need to tell you more
I needed a raise
I worked so hard for this love of mine
Still, I got nothing to show for it
Here's a simplification of everything we're going through, oh
You plus me is bad news
You're a lovely creation
I like to think that I am too
My friends said I look better without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Tongue tied and twisted
Go on, baby, go to my head

[Chorus]
Babe, baby, believe me
If I stay, it ain't gonna be easy
Okay, wе'll do it your way
But this is the last time
You'll hear thе beautiful sound of love coming down
Love on the rocks, yeah

You love the chase but hate me for the runaround
We both just tired of the whole thing
And you tell me what you want you need you know you have to have
I just pretend I'm listening

[Pre-Chorus]
Too tired this time (oh)
To deal with old suits you wear, your ties that won't bind

[Chorus]
Babe, baby, believe me
Ooh, if I stay, it ain't gonna be easy
Okay, we'll do it your way
But this is the last time
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down

[Bridge]
Hot as hell, cold as ice, sip it slow 'cause it's so nice
Dulls my senses, drives my pain, but I do it again
Burns a bit to the touch, dangerous if it's too much
If this bottle could talk
