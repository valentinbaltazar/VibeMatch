Mama!

[Chorus: Felly]
I think they coming for my freedom
They wanna gun me, desert eagle
A bunch of egos, I don't feed 'em
Know they gon' love me then they leave him

[Verse 1: Felly & GYYPS]
I was playing on a C-Note (brr brr)
And make my baby bend down real low
Look at my sneakers, swear they real though
In NYC puffin' illegal, yeah
You startin drama I'm like
Bitch give me this, another bitch give me that
I got some problems with myself, I put that shit on the bench
Boy is you crying for some help? You better go and attack
You see them tugging on your belt, you put yourself on the map
Think I need Jesus
Think that I need need him I know that I need him
I pray on my knees yuh
It's cold, it's freezin'
Cold as a freezer
I came in this world, I don't know how I'm leaving
I don't believe 'em
Fuck the whole system
I pick up the pieces and come off a dreamer
I don't believe ya
I never need 'em
The world that I seen, I’m surprised I’m still breathing

I think they coming for my freedom
You gon' bring that to NYC?
I'm bringing that shit
I'm bringing my whole percussion box
I think they coming for my freedom

[Verse 2: GYYPS & Felly]
Pull up, key in, start
Bitch, Canoga Park
Thats that shit out the two car garage
Check off the list now I hit the menage
Never looking back on a bitch and that’s that
I could do laps around underground rappers
With double cup stacked, you can take a step back
If you feeling like shit, go work the night shift
First thing's first, I've been up all night
Dip and reverse brown piece on my side
Cook up the herse but I'd rather not die
Pull up to shows with my homies for life
Needing my shawty to drive, you feelin' alright?
We eat at La Tequiza for beans and the rice
Like every night
Ayy true, Fel can I ask you a question?
Yeah, ask all the questions you want bro
Just know I don't have all the answers
Ayy yo, what's the message?
All of these kids, I'm too old for this shit
Think they all got it backwards
Yo, what you been planning?
Build a militia and fuck with the system
Let's get at the bastards
Ayy, let me get at this
I only use to do ad-libs
Don't let me fade in the blackness
[Chorus: Felly]
I think they coming for my freedom
They wanna gun me, desert eagle
A bunch of egos, I don't feed them
Know they gon' love me then they leave him

[Verse 4: GYYPS]
Damnside dimebag, call me young Darryl
Running over squirrels in a Pontiac Fiero
Rob another life, I'ma dance like dinero
I could jock a side bag, I'm a fucking weirdo
Sell a couple Vyvanse, library hero
Visa Visa Master, that's a kapa kapa kilo
Free the calipaint in California through an eagle
Never leaving either even if it's just a guiro

[Verse 5: Felly]
Bless it up
Motherfucking spliff to my motherfucking dome
Penicillin scripts, I got something in my throat
Calling on my phone, only pick up for my mom
That's a bomb, call the bomb squad
Life is bigger then the shit up on your i-Phone
Fuck a signal, losing tension like a blind spot
I'a slip until the slippers made of nylon
I'm smoking lala
[Outro: Felly]
I feel like lately I can't take the pain
I'm praying patiently for better days, ayy
Know these relationships gon' fade away
So I'll keep waiting on a brighter day

Yeah
Uh, coming out the house to a pack of that loud
I had it mailed in the mail
I got love for the girls in the crowd
Getting lost in the marijuana clouds
Hey don't look down, homie don't look down
Said I swim in the sound
Only thing more raw is the shit I put out
A go-getter, a gorilla, a trendsetter
Got vendettas with dope dealers with no fillings
I don't feel those who claim they're the best ever
You no dealer, my crew iller
Ya get scared, just a block downtown
Walkin' past a little van
You's about to sell out
Slow dance i'm the man you ain't go another round
Throw fists been a cage bird inside a dog pound
I don't fuck with your sister, brother
Talk shit, you can kiss the gutter
Pucker up boy I fix the stutter
Young Gyyps be the wicked drummer
All hits we goin' skip the come up
I'm going big tomorrow
At seven ten gonna tighten the load
Meditate wake up with the sun
I don't do this for fun
I do this so my blood pump
What it is what it do what the fuck's up?
I came through with the nunchucks
Heard a little birdy listen, tell say

Asking Gypps what I'm doing now

Grooving down in the grill to some dancehall
Playing loud shit is ill I can't stand y'all

Yall should prob take my advice and keep walking

I’m on probation I can’t smoke too much!

No I don’t supply i just smoke it up
You got the wrong guys you don’t know bout us
This shit be too smooth for me to take it all
Are you gonna break or fall? Nah I’d rather hit the stage with y’all

Bloaw, bloaw. Once I finish school i’ll take you on a tour ow
Ow started trying less and started getting more!
And this ones for the nights spent on the floor
Anything to move around this world
It’s that mista fel they all know me well
Them subs be low as hell
Everybody show love now
We oklahoma bound
Roll it up and blow that loud
Feeling so strange they never own up to the shit that they say
Do what I do what just to keep from my grave
Sliding through the bus stops
All bloodshot
They be coming for my blood don’t buss shots

Down in montego bunnin right pon the dock
We respect dem and dem respect us, oyyyyy!

That empty solo
So cal as cholos

Doing better than I ever done
Young fel be the medicine
Finna get 6 figures for my stepson
Tell em move to the left we the next ones

Some cops be trying to arrest us, depress us
We the the ones without the weapons, good heavens
Rock the stage until the people gimme love like I don get none damn

While my grandmother's scarf comforts me
But you look ugly
And I ain't ever trippin' 'bout the lack of company
Cause honestly I'm sittin' here alone quite comfortably
Depressed through this dimension
And I think I failed to mention
That I feel like I been runnin' outta seconds
Nobody gave a forewarning nor a preface
Followin' my dreams feel like followin' my death wish

[Verse 1]
She said she know just how that stress gets
When you hungry and you just tryna eat breakfast and nobody feel your message feel
Good enough to wake up and then fall back to sleep
It's a bad car to go get involved in like half the shit that I see
Plus I feel happier in my dreams, right
I spit that shit that give the feeling of the seaside
Hungover in Pitts
But with the flick of the wrist
Yo I can kick shit like this
I be as good as it gets
Even through all my vices
My inner being Rastafarian
Always one-hunnid three times you'll get Spartacus
What's with all you knock-offs, and self-conscious narcissists?
Said I'm an artist bitch, do this shit so artifice
In it for the hardships the nonsense of reapin' attention
Homie rolled up a blessing
We in a world with no exits
You gotta give me a second
Straighten up and get balanced
My homie flipped on a record
I beat it up ain't no challenge

[Verse 2]
Ayo, reach and you slip a backpedal
I do my homework blazed and gets A's I'm mad mellow
I hear the sad fellows get they fix when I spit
Like that sun up in the sky you must protect or you get hit
Sometimes life is full of shit too many damn to-do lists
But yo I learned if you ain't coolin' you just being foolish
I used to think that I'ma die early, like mid-thirties
But fuck that I'ma rise early, and ride dirty
I reach the crucifix up to my lips and then I kiss it
I try to walk with God but got some holes up in my slippers
And so I keep on slippin'
Get tangled in the mischief
So in a nutshell I'm just a sinner named Christian
But still they keep me spinnin' when they drinkin' on they lonely
High rollin' like Jody, eyes open, got stolen by this music shit
And I don't think I'm coming back (what that is bro)

Aye, said I don’t smoke no cigarettes
But if I did I would smoke ‘em with you
The way you move it from the tip of your lips
And flickin’ your wrist
I really don’t know what to do
You want the lies or the truth?
I keep that faith without proof
And i'll be damned if the devil want a seat in my room
We 'coulda stunt, but we grew
She lace me up in that noose
Your lady-luck just keep fuckin up my day-to-day moves
Hope I don’t fade away soon
From Playstation on that basketball
To no sleep from the Adderall
She keep my clothes for collateral
And after all it’s said and done
I did my time and had my fun
But homie pass the blunt
Before I have to run away to somewhere far away
The destination I won’t mention (no, no)
C’mon smile it’s depressing
I lost my mom when dad died, but shit it taught me lessons
I guess time bombs happen
Sad but still we laughin’
Lemme put this in the attic (yup, yup)
If you got the means of doin' somethin’ big then make it happen
But if you gonna let your craft get dusty
Bring it right back to the attic and stop bein’ so dramatic
Not responsible for anything that happens
Or anything that doesn’t
I just wanna see my team turn to somethin’
Other than the coke or the smoke that people puffin’
Let’s find a new subject maybe change the world or somethin’
Bring up goals without nothin’, fuck it
All I want in life is the sun and good loving
Climbing up these heights just to jump from the summit
And I never stay too long and after this I’m probably runnin’, runnin’...See Felly LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also like2Embed",11,/songs/2396755,Sun and Good Loving by Felly,https://images.genius.com/bc9ccb23fd35c4fdff936b8d9e18d1e5.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/bc9ccb23fd35c4fdff936b8d9e18d1e5.1000x1000x1.jpg,333056,complete,/Felly-sun-and-good-loving-lyrics,2,https://images.genius.com/bc9ccb23fd35c4fdff936b8d9e18d1e5.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/bc9ccb23fd35c4fdff936b8d9e18d1e5.1000x1000x1.jpg,Sun and Good Loving,https://genius.com/Felly-sun-and-good-loving-lyrics,,,,,,,

From the top of the earth
Don’t question the purpose
Here to give every last bit of my worth
That’s what they deserving
The skeleton in me won’t settle for dirt
So open them curtains

I coulda got nervous, instead I got dirty
Pressure don’t kill me the peasants they feel me I light up existence
Like mecca within me , its precious the feelin of feelin so limit
Less getting too lifted and losing my grip shall I fall by my finger
Tips or be an amazement, it’s not complicated
Don’t ever get jaded
They try to degrade us the system gets wicked
Talk the talk and walk the walk til blisters, stop acting like the victim
You don’t have to live in prison nah
Unlock yourself and free the other prisonas
I pack up the passion, hop in the whip and I drop into blackness
Yea, this world stay spinning fast just try not to lose your balance, pray the best is on the ballot...
Probably swiped my name off
Mothafucka this my day job its 9 to 5 then 5 to 9 no days off
I can’t stay in the same spot
Anxiety hits
Can't wait too long or depression’ll sit
Thought you were strong but it ain't what you lift
It’s the life that live
It's the shit that you spit
So come get a grip
Kick it a week and I've been up since six
Trippin’ of days when I fall to abyss

You know it's been a long day

Don't give no reason to trust me
Wonder why you even, why you love me at all
But I get this feeling you have mercy
Yeah, them powers healing, and I'm worthy

Caught in the turmoil
So poised (so poised)

Kick my feet up and swallow the pain
No choice (no choice)
Just tell me everythings okay
What don't kill me gon' bring me strength

Now I'm in the streets where I piss
Took it overseas on you bitches
Leather seats in the whip
Somewhere between a priest and a pimp
Coolin' with my Texas shorty
She like Fel you gettin' hella gaudy
Stop flexin' maybe tell a story a good one
I think they're startin' to undo my stitches
Peep the people lookin' at me different
Don't understand the friction
Now I already got enough and east coast know you've got my love
Is you with me is you with me sing it to me though I've got to know
We've come far but so much to go (I'm yellin' vamonos)
Thought it was cool so I threw 'em my two
Know it's been, all blue since I've been with you
And things go, fall through like the midnight moon with ""World Famous"" on the shoes
What did they cost you?
My shorty just like me
She don't play this scene
We think the La Quinta Versace we just hang in the sheets
Until I got a catch a plane but I'll back next week
Then I go stranger once again no text don't speak
This life funny could've sworn I've seen it once in my dreams
But all the liqour and the melodies been makin' me weep

They watch my numbers
And they treat me shady
Keep me covered going in this might get wavy

(Verse 1)
Pick it up where I left off
Nothin’ left at the press box
And they heard Imma twist my dreadlocks
Like you best not
Fix me up with that headshot
Cause this world be spinning too fast for me
Hard times we take them casually
No problems got no enemies
I hope eerything good don’t end!
Palm trees and g Pens
Think I’m fallin in the deep end
Yeah, but I hang 10
This that bang bang boogie
This that grand slam rookie
Stay good like gram made cookies
Do shit they swear we couldn’t
Yo this my exposition
And the more they talk the less I listen
Y’all just sit around and smoke them blunts and blame the system
Quite ambitious
Check those packages we been deliverin’ thats the difference
Moving through the city looking all suspicious
Rasta vision, cutting checks,  killin competition
Through the legs, only shoot swishes, only mess with cute bitches
The stoop kids of LA
Said i’ll be here for a minute then I’m gone the next day
But that’s okay
Let me worry bout me
She be like while don’t you just stay
I got too much up on my plate
I’ll be back around the way
I been moving in my ‘92
Honda civic coupe
With the sunroof missing too
I feel like mista cool
No one said a thing ‘bout rules, so we make our own
Roll it up i’m coming through
I need that for my dome
Born some time in ‘95
I had my smile wild shouts to cops who let it slide
It’s been a wild ride
This my light i let it shine
They never put it out do that shit they talk about, what you ‘bout

I need my money I need it now

[Verse 1]
I need my money I need it now
I need my money I need it now
That's all I got when you're not around (I need my money)
I'll call you up when I'm back in town
I'm up to no good when not around
Cause you know temptations, they all around

[Chorus]
I had to make something for you
And let you know how much you mean to me
I'm always runnin' from the truth
I'm always thinkin' 'bout me (bout me)
But shit I like the way you groove
I'd like to think it's just for me
All the shit I'm scared to lose
Think I should probably get some sleep

[Verse 2]
Saucin' just a starvin' artist somewhere out in Austin
With 1000 people mobbin' to some some shit I made in private school
Coughin' all my darkness, turn it into light
Ain't no doctors in my life
Don't need pills just need my pipe
Think a builder's skin is white
Fuck 'em if they hit the clock
Can't take credit for my type
Only God knows that design
Told her how I, all I, all I, all I need is a goddess
Answer to all my problems and suddenly I'm reminded
What it's like to not be blinded open up my sirens
Lil b might know I'm gone, she smell the rubber from the tires
I know you're gettin' tired I don't mean to be dishonest
When I told you that I loved you I don't know what I just plotted
Woke up in my apartment all alone and in the quiet
Solitude at its finest, look for the ultraviolets
First time I met you told you that I loved you but I didn't
She said it's cool Imma still let you hit it

My girl got a lil butt but i like it
I rock nikes in the lightnin’
So excitin’ why you come to spots fighting
We ones who make the world spin so brightly
Take a likin’ and hey say they fel is getting pricey
Rocking headbands running with the bison
Y’all ain’t gotta like me
Lets see i’m birthed out of bridgeport
Raised out in t-town i was rocking my jansport
I must keep my hands warm
That winter storm hit more like sandstorms
But get up and dance more
I’m somewhere on that metro tryna find me some
More shit to fill up in my styrofoam to mix with my soda, and this shit sound like it outta
I see some wonderful daughters, got some wonderful friends
Only fuck with the positive
Never riding the bench
Getting caught by the the feds
Trny run up that fence
Y’all supposed to keep me safe feel like you just want me dead
Ayo muscato
We gone count our damn dollars and pay your dad back for all the drama
Oh this world is so strange
My homies all on that cane
But that shit ain’t for me
That’s why i find others ways
To stay lifted
Heeeyy
And if you tryna deal with same then come head out this way
Let’s get busy, baby
All i ever wanted was a lil bit of everything

(Verse 2)
And she don’t got a lot of money but she like it
She think the world is too priceless
And i’m the type to run from the shit i find enticing
And i don’t always like me
But you, you always like me
And now i’m get pricey (damn)
Waking up on floors of different houses almost on the nightly
So yeah it’s pretty likely that i’m gon’ forget you
I’m busy making art pieces, steppin on step stools
The pressure will get you
Don’t let it depress you
I used to make a mess now i make instrumentals and keep it so benzo

Waiting on the sunrise (x2)
Hey yeah

[Hook: Felly]
Waiting on the sunrise, they lonely
I see it when they walk by, they only
Just caught up in these hard times, it's okay
Just making through these dark night
Waiting on the sunrise, they lonely
I see them when they walk by, they only
Just caught up in these hard times, it's okay
Just need a little sunshine

[Verse 1: Felly]
Give me that ass girl
Give me that grip I need it
I've been waiting and waiting and I know you've been sleeping
You stole my blanket, you let the boy freezing
Plus in the morning I'm leaving
All that I'm left with is sheets and the weed from the pipe, she stole my breathin'
Thought she was wifey, must have been dreamin'
Waiting on sun, waiting for someone to give me some love
I don't feel it no more
Now that I'm on tour, just love after love
I've been asking for more
These bitches so up they intention is short
[?] what you won an award?
I'm just a piece of your puzzle, no more
But shit it's just love let it all play its chords
Probably go end in divorce
I keep my foot to the floor
What you mistook me for?
Messing with freaks, something like every week
Mic em' up I got my foot in the door
Give me some hits it might cook me some more
Skirts getting short, weed in the blunt
Another night waiting on the sunrise

And I've been waiting on the sunrise

I've been trying to leave
Catching fly through my team
Take me out to L.A., I'm too fucked for this shit
I need friends to escape
But the friends that I need ain't gon come till I'm payed
So I'm stuck for a while, until I get payed
But right now, the ramen noodles right next to the Hennessy
She told me
She told me, it gets better
It's lonely, it's lonely, but I can't hold my liquor
So I'm gonna smoke my weed
And I can't hold my liquor
So I'm gonna smoke my weed

To the rooftop sweets, where the parents be

To the top of the earth for the sunset

Cuttin' like surgeon, never fell in love with the searchings
Never found love so deserting, I be so far from perfect girl

Between love and fear
Girl, be nice to me, yeah
She said she need a re-up
That's not a bad idea
And if looks can kill ya
I'd be unfamiliar
We could do it for real, though
Depends on how you feel, though
Funny how you treat me like I'm new to this shit
I've been moving like I got a fucking movie to script, yeah
Lifestyle left my heart as a souvenir
'Round the world leaving parts 'til its hard to feel love

[Pre-Chorus]
I fear the fall off, got fucking problems
Won't fucking cut costs, you know it's on us
Might fall in love and spend the night (Night)

[Chorus]
Kiss me 'fore I go, let me know you a rider
Kiss me 'fore I go, let me know, let me know, yeah
Kiss me 'fore I go, let me know you a rider

I hope you play it everyday
I can't complain, you hard to blame
I did some things, it's not the same
Reno last show, I caught a flame
I'm on a plane, you wait up late
PTSD inside her brain
But it's okay, it's all a game
And you surrounded by love, why you hide under fear?
I ain't even out the gate, just say I had a good year, oh yeah
Lighting up to the top 'til I start to chill
Break your heart, fix you up 'til you start to feel love

Luscious blonded-haired chick staring right at me
I think that she aware that I've been feeling unhappy
I'll give you my soul but don't think it'd be attractive
And honestly you blowing me away with the patterns
Winters in L.A., summer time in Manhattan
I find myself asking if I'm really that happy
Should I pack the bags up and start being average?
You give them your soul and they go put it in trash cans
We did too much acid that day back in Staten
Now every time my back bend I feel the reaction
I find myself laughing, knowing they read me backwards
Pax while I'm driving to where the gate need a password
My rich girl another beautiful disaster
She said she only chill with musicians and actors
Can tell by every Instagram photo she asks for
And how she blow a pill anytime she needs laughter
She called me a bastard
Like I ain't supposed to know she sad
I'm only entertainment, what the fuck I know bout that?
Said a killer freeze, never gonna kill again
Tell you I love you and I never wanna chill again
Still got the illest pen
Never get comfortable
Never thought my hatred could make something so lovable
But as I sip a couple couple more to cleanse my sins
Realized I'm as lonely as I've ever been

But the sun comes up
A brand new day to reevaluate my trust and test my luck
Wonder how they break me down and build me up
We hate to love
That feelin hit me when i sobered up
While makin love somewhere by the ocean front
Thats wassup
Sipping on that passion fruit
She got the attitude to make you feel like you the reason she been in a bad mood
I usually throw light upon those negatives and improve
Focus on what we did do and smile like them kids do
You gotta learn to let it be
I’m not the type to let one rainy day upset my week
Cause we can rest in peace without fulfilling destinies

He finna stack to the black, all bulletproof
Making platinum, I'll blast off, bust a move
Little Max said she love me, I love you too
But that stress make you ugly, that black and blue
You know that light can be lovely, just let it through
While she sip from the bubbly, like ""Yeah, that's true""
I'm like ""Yeah, that's true""

Keep the kid writing like he supposed to
And the blueprint ain't never how you wanna
But that's the point, you supposed to wander
And take yo' chance like its [poker], dancing like [polka]
Antsy like groceries that's left over, pants be too [?], ten deep on my shoulder
Smoking on some of that learnt when you're older, fool
I don't play by the rules
I love getting money when I'm skipping on school
A few in the living room, like what a view
Seven-three to the end when you those twos
I hope the green don't get the blues

We could kick shit like Bruce Lee all day
And you look so good, wish I could mount you on my wall

We could go and swipe a VISA for some pizza
Apple TV got the movies, we can screen 'em
Fresher than a fuckin' preacher on the day of Easter
And you could buy the bitch, we just tryna lease her
Baby girl, don't smoke too much
And when you give me brain I hope that you don't choke too much
And when I'm gone, I hope that you don't talk so much
And I'll be riding 'round the city as I hold that clutch

Freezed up, bass hit
Up and copy, paste it
Drink till I be, wasted
And this world so, tasteless
Dead friends on my bracelets
My death sentence need patience
Once you make it erase it
Don't get lost in the matrix
I board that train up with no ticket keep my eyes up for booby traps
Deal with all my problems keep them locked up in Gucci bags
My homie popping perks I told his dumb ass stop doing that
That high might be alright but know that come down so blue and black
And every single second slip these serpents never let me live
They want to test your grip, like will you hold on or slip
There must be some way out, because suicide too mainstream
Depressed that's how my days be, your memories just pain me

[Hook: Felly]
Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
But with you, and loving you

[Verse 2: Felly]
Damn, like here we go again
Playing records, let them spin
I Hope the heavens let me in
So I can greet you but wait, hope you're not down in flames
That devil shit be fucking strange
It's not your fault you crashed your plane
But then again it is, now I'm out getting ribs
And searching for my exorcist, so demons let the games begin
Getting too high, my friends all getting too high
There's no surprise, I knew that was the case when you died
And I don't wanna see another pill again they killing friends
I wish the devil and god inside you would've just made a mends

You don't know love 'til you meet another one
Show you how to grow up
'Cause you know there's no need to be someone
Feeling so numb when I need somebody even though it's not funny
Do you know what it's like to need, need, need?
Keeping in touch but only so much 'cause it's not worth the fuss
Do you know what it's like to leave someone?
Since we was young, where you'd go, I would run
But it's all been undone, really no need to be so apart

Can we keep this shit between us? (I'm yours)
The summertime's the hardest, and the wintertime is meaner
I'm in love with your aura, no Rita, oh, oh
Until I get my stripe like Jeter, gold ticket like Dreamville
My love hard to swallow like E-pills, the weed kills all of my thoughts
Emotions get missed like emails, I'm stuck here in the dark
Where there ain't no oxygen, down where the Loch Ness is
Down like my moccasins, I call the shots
She ain't too talkative, but she still talk that shit
I just keep locking in, I want the top
I can see the view from here and it's precious (Ooh)
Once I'm off those antidepressants, I'll get you stretching
Dive in that, uh, you venomous, you leave me severed
Girl, I'm a dope fiend, I console through these lessons
Flew back for Christmas, Ma ain't sure where my head is

I can't lie
This years been the darkest one in my whole life
And I can't count the nights where I thought I'm goin' die
Been sorting through your lies, they still keep me up at night
And I just thank God my girl is still by my side
And at the same time I'm tryna fuck every night
And I don't care who as long as that ass is tight
And its like, when the time, in my mind, yeah I'm colder than outside
Never home, always tired yeah

The soul of a cellphone, been lookin' at the end bro
A spliff and some L though, I'm free
Just wanted to be well known, and now that I'm well known, just wanna feel peace
Yeah yeah, I'm used to playing dumb, I don't like anyone
My circle getting small lately
We was just having fun, until I got stung, I had it comin' anyway though
You could fool everybody but yourself, the smiles fade overtime could use some help
I booked four vacations to the finest locations
I still couldn't get away from myself
So light the palo santo, and the sage, and the yerba, and the fronto
I been planting all my seeds just to find out
They was hollow
How many miles can you put on one's soul until the smile starts to blend into one big bullet hole?

Sparkin' a lantern
I lay myself, its Saturn feelin smaller than an atom
And we on earth, bitchin bout , Chances album

Plus the homies in your squad sound like they racist

But I probably should be dead the reaper think I'm precious cargo

And lay a boy to his death

Check
Imma only sip that tea if it’s Irish
Get on my feet I’m done sitting in silence
I burn the weed until I feel the weight cover my eyelids
I try to sleep I keep awaking to sirens
I handle business solo
Pray to God that I can grow old
Have a family and some money on the low low
Had a homie recognize and ask me for a photo (what’s up?)
Wonder why I’m special like there’s something in the ozone
It’s in my best interest to invest then leave
Cause people only admire the plant never the seed
So what’chu need?
I think I got it, used to wanna be a pilot
Now I get fly like every time I breathe
Picture me
Maybe it’s killing me
Maybe I’m the only one not feeling me
Shoot for divinity and nothing less
My sixth sense sip that Hennessey till sick breath
And then I burn like the incense

Window shoppin’
Around the corner I’ll be Janis Joplin
Strung out but still makin’ profit
But ain't no Xany poppin’
I worked to hard for that shit
Rockin’ cardigans bumpin’ in a car full of kids
The most beautiful
Don’t think my suitcase too suitable
Don’t wanna leave, it feel like flyin’ to my funeral
Rather hit the Gucci store than hit the L
And throw that Gucci out the window, only feel myself
Tryna be a shell on the beach with too much of a current
I give ‘em dap and tell ‘em “peace, I’ll be gone don’t’chu worry”
I’m in a hurry tryna leave school
Hangin’ round with these fools
That only say some shit to try to make me think that be cool
But be cool
That girl gon’ love you then she prolly gonna leave you
Last time that I was thinkin clear was prolly preschool
Everything I think is good, they callin’ that shit evil
That stress keep me puffin’ on illegal
But fuck my conscience
I swear I’m only being honest when I say I’m givin’ everything
I check my pockets, eyo
Ain’t no poppin’ a coffin until my throat silence
And there’s no sirens
And I got closed eyelids

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me give you everything you need
Tastin’ something really stale in the air I breathe
Dreamt of dyin last night, I don’t wanna leave
Gon’ fight the good fight ‘til my blood it bleed

These streets are frozen
On that black ice while rap tight
Drive it like you stole it
With my two cents I'll invest
Wait a few years to be impressed
Well this nothin yet
I'm still young, I'm still workin' on my kingdom
With that bullshit that you pumpin' son
See through that transparent
Take what I want you keep staring
Back to my lab start preparing that quality
I move around while they follow me
Split the green dichotomy
Better get the fuck off my property
Cause I'm probably
Too damn dope for them name brands
We spit, we don’t shake hands
Get crack chicks and Ray-Bans
To rap my lines verbatim
Ya, mommy got me hotter than Wasabi shawty
Ask me if I'm blowin' up, I told her baby probably
Don't wanna stumble from the B.P.T. until Trumbull
Hit the field and then I cause Trouble
Made a profit then I made double
Still my raincoat like four bucks

Really I am not one
Cause to many claim that
Thinking on my toe
I spit it quick I spit it asap
Think that it's so laid back
And rep for my homeland
Tell the flowbots I can ride with no hands
Not a happy camper
I try tho trust tho trust me
Winters get cold in CT I'd be a Husky
Hate loud women
And I don't care for class
All you snobby rich kids can really kiss my ass
Got my finger on the trigger of the xbox controller

One two one two
You test my patience
I hope you make it
I'm living better than the rest of the dudes who don't pay no dues, they break it
Awaken
My soul
Banging  like bongos
These headaches don't stop yo
No patience, no console
Losing all my conciousness
Wake up feeling nauseous, shit
I wasted all my pocket lint
So I can feel incompetent
Low key
Bringing cold shit
Switching up to that potent
Shit, I believe I was chosen
To kick this shit til' I'm broken
These beats bang when I can't sleep
Thinkin bout what can't be
Like other planets
Acid trips
Retaliate with pacisifists
Euphoria don't let me lose
I'm falling through with bad news
Buzz on me like tatoos
Too far to jump back to
[Bridge]
My old ways
Walked through life the cold way
Stumbling through the whole day
I'm jumping to the basics
Wondering if I'll make it
Or is this time just wasted
Cause things dont always work out like you want them to
And people here are crazy who you talking to
Need to awake it
Changes to be made quick
Before this time is wasted

[Verse 2]
Feeling like I could die in a few minutes
I be building up to get finished
Lost in my sinning
My goals in my vision
Trying to figure out what is and what isn't
Looking at the mirror
My I've grown
And I thrive and though I just cope
About to live slow and die old
But with this hand I might fold
Out of the country feeling like a junkie
Thinking how the fuck some people live comfy
Want to the see the bright side, but shit ugly
Twenty six dead like twenty miles from me
That's why I break away and it's safe to say
That today was cold but tomorrow is freezing
Hold me down I'm wide awake
Got mad complaints but at least I'm breathing
I'll cope
And grow
Even when these days go up and down and move around so slow
To the hope
I'll hope
It won't ever ever ever ever ever let it go
Everyday is a blessing
Everyday is depressing
Contradictions keep me sweating
And I'm always second guessing
Feeling restless
Yeah I'm restless
Freaking out with every sentence
My stress hits
My duty
To give you yours truly

Uh, dream, dream, dream, like you’ve never dreamt
I kill myself to stay relevant
Just so I can sleep effortless
Gotta twist up the evidence
Spliff tell I’m heaven sent

When the beat drop
I be on degrees like my tea pot
Girls know the team hot

Blast through your beat box
Your rap game, Steve Jobs
Back pain, still pulling boats out the marina, uh
Sitting sideways
Sippin on sundays
Catching fade
Getting blazed in the shade, uh
She only trying to get wavy
Why my people so complacent?
I don’t want pictures, I want paintings
These Felly raps bring helipads
Damn, you been through hell and back
I could probably break the map
When you rare as pterodactyl
Ashing on the porch, while Gyppsy ask for tattoos
My momma say we bad news
But shit y'all made me have to
I'm lo-, loading up a little Cali
Don't nobody kill nobody
Close to fame, and don't know how I feel about it
Through shades of Lennon, all I do is dream on
And say my prayers in attempts to be God
Doing the Devil his job
But guess who dealt you those odds?
So you should pack up your bags and get off the next stop
I swear these days, I've been dazed
They been lasting to long
Thinking that I might call it all off
I just wanna sip some juice with my girl
I don't wanna think about the world
But if the rain falls. the soil is fertile
I grow and die to it come full circle

And all the cocaine, I saw it
Get the propane for my momma
She can grill steak in the mornin'
Haven't ate in days, so my brain is open
Can't see straight, so I'm hanging over
The paint is showing, the paint is golden
I got gold chains like David Bowie
No I didn't motherfucking pay, I stole it
Going insane, ain't afraid to know it
In my garage, it's way deep in Canoga
Neighbor a gangster, her daughter a chola
I seen them titties, the window was open
Speaking in Spanish, quiero te boca

'Bout the words that I'm spurting, when she hear my verses
I ain't too worried cause I got a plan to make all these fans fucking worship in churches

Met some hoes in seattle
They was hot
Then we made love on the spot, that’s what’s up
Back in ‘06 i was ridin’ round the block (holdup)
Can find me at the footlocker
With the DS 1
While my brother cop the reebok pumps
Man we was young
Now tommy sniffing addy off his ps1
And i’m almost tall enough to dunk (like what the fuck)

No more buildin’ coffins
Took a sec to look at my soul, and told me never let go

It’s quite scary i play a role in your health
I wish you well
And i be tellin’ lies
To say my pain never left
Smoke a thousand joints on my deck before my death
Depression started creepin’ in my freshman year of college
Trying to be polished turned into big problems
In my dorm room, suicidal thoughts made the forward move
Momma thought i cut the chord
‘cause i wouldn’t pick up my phone
Hope you forgive me now, i’m out on the road
I did my first 30 shows
I couldn’t wait to go home
Down to the basement in my crib
Where i could be on my own
And i ain’t gotta worry about fresh clothes
Or clickin’ photos, i’m drinkin’ four mo’
They fake as fuck, i don’t catch feelings no more
Shit all i feel is velour
I paralyzed by my freedom, i don’t know what to do
Look in the mirror it’s true
Ain’t nobody got more lemons than you. (you x8)

State of the art
Playing my cards (keep at)
Replay swinging like I'm, hanging on bars (keep on)
Playing your part
We don't need your negativity
Until you napping kiddies I will, be your epiphany
Breaking the symmetry
Kicking it raw I stay, testing divinity
Swimming with Jaws like you, you must be kidding me
I keep on smiling
And I pushed the right buttons
You a chick drunk dialing
Got it right now
I'm low key with the hype sound
So put the mic down I can see your night gown
It's bedtime for you sunrise for me
You can try to hold me down but I'm untied and free
Out to get mine, and leave my mark like graffiti
Spilling wet on the train cars
Seeing round the city
Got two, books in my bag
One for art one for spitting
Stay creative with my writtens
Brutalizing every victim
Realizing shit ain't gonna change unless I make the difference
Long road ahead but shit I'm down to go the distance
I'm determined
And leave them burning when I kick my sermon
All the pain that life exerted let it banish in my words
And now I'll never bow down to no human
Got the mind state if you can do it I can do it
And even better
This ain't no sing a long child's song, stupid
This a suffocating artist find the breath in his music
That's truth
So who are you?
Only way I'm going out, is through the roof
Survived the hardest parts now there's nothing left to lose
Couldn't take your lies so now I've found my own truth
This is what I'm here to do(x3)
You better find your own truth

This is the first day of my life
I swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain; suddenly, everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don’t know where I am
I don’t know where I’ve been
But I know where I'd like to be

[Chorus]
And so, I thought I’d let you know
That these things take forever
I'm especially slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home
Oh

[Verse 2]
I remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said “This is the first day of my life
I’m glad I didn’t die before I met you
But now, I don’t care; I could go anywhere with you
And I’d probably be happy”

And I wish I could chill
Spend some time with my friends
Celebrate keeping it real

Wake up to rap practice stomach full a fat bastard
I got some friends who would jump in front of pistols for me
So I ain't trippin homie if I die they sip it for me

Don't remember what we did (yeah)
Spent the nights tryna kill myself

To the real ones who still with you

Now I'm cautious, gaurdin' my profits
Could take another loss if you really got a issue

New crib with a view, Bushwick from the roof
Tell em that everything cool

Don't flinch, if you do I'ma shoot
Look at how I handle my tune
Get out the panic cocoon
All of these cameras but none this shit cool
In the capital, show me don't play by the rules
Got a cap and gown still that goes dumb on you fools
I had 30 bad hoes in a crew
Cell phone, you gotta hand it too
Tell Ramona lay off the brews
I stay in my zone, I can't stand to lose
But shit, they go be talkin' that bullshit
I call the shots, got a full clip
And I bust through the window like, ""roll this shit""

[Verse]
Lets go
Life gon' get you down but its cool (its cool)
That sunshine don't around [?]
Keep watch on me
This is how the shit gon' be
This that shit to make you feel free
This ain't what they put on TV
Close my eyes but still I don't sleep
No I'm never getting no rest
And they keep watch on me
Want my soul right out of my chest
Watch your step
Keep my hands tight prayin to a god that I don't know
Your girl only twelve singing coco
Dance slow
Cuff got me tucked in a choke hold
She won't cut less you cut checks in Kyoto
They know
Rooftops since a day old
Same kid, they surprised that I came home
Get lit, red wrist and potatoes
Best watch, make calls from a pay phone
Bitch
I'm asleep when they casket closed
Roll deep till they pack the shows
Its F-E-to the L B-RO
They call the shit when my jacket on
The flow Babylon
Boy stop it
Don't act like Nicholson, yeah
I'm supposed to be the little kid, bruh
You could ask god if they give a shit
Everybody die, it would do no different
Death come, imma miss the bus
Hey tell me who you trust
That poker face might have a flush
Just hope my cheeks don't blush
The watch us want to be like us
Just for the way we stunt
The mortal man keep breathing (uh)
I keep on keeping on
You think my self esteem be gone
The way they read me wrong
But I don't take much to the dome
I sit backstage come light the bong
You think I'm nice, wait till I'm on
Wait till my season come
They come around like Collie Buddz
It feel too good its probably love

But I could fuck just let me live

I want my people on top of speakers getting lit

Why, don't you just get loose and feel these vibes?
And, baby, come alive, come alive, come alive

[Verse 1]
Took a walk outside, seen a crop top
Pretty-ass girl with a vibe, made my jaw drop
Know she peeped the style I can call bluffs
But no reply, no smile like my call blocked (Ayy)
This a big body no drop top
Rap not a hobby no more, I'm on the shot clock
Point two left I'll go Zion, young lion coming for Zion
Made a lot of o's I could kiss myself
A lot of hoes turn me into Miguel
I skywalk to Madonna like my dear
Walk to the front of the club like I'm Bia
Get some of your own money honey, don't run my well
Although it won't run dry,  she wanna  kiss and tell
They under the spell, I keep it on the D-low
The hoes is Creole, the Rhodes is seafoam

Cold-blooded in the Kangol fit

Watch the white kids all copy my hair-do (Damn)
80K on Air BnB's (80K)
So hell naw, no free CD's
Your record all Z-Z-Z's, like where the fuck is your energy?
Take two sips so you tipsy, yeah I ain't called I been busy
What the fuck you add to the mix?
Played twenty shows down on Sixth Street
Gatorade blue on the kicks rest in peace to Nipsey (Uh)
I got love, yeah the world can have it (Ayy)

They found me making out with a cactus
Stay cool it's just a right of passage

All this drama in the world keep me low
I don't really want love on the low
All I really need know is love come and go
And I rather have a few you don't know about
East Coast on my crew and we rollin' out
They don't even have a clue, now they know now
And I did all the things that I wrote about (mmh mh)
Start up automatic, when I get in I just need my phone
Sitting on high fashion with a bad bitch and I'm home, sweet home
Kids they think they holy, they just lonely and best left alone
Heard you got your racks up and a mansion but your passion gone
Air it out, having sex, singing like Barry now, White
Fair amount, had a bunch of grams in my hand now, aight

Swear down, someone tell the opps I'll be here while-

I wonder if Jesus had these temptations
That got the boy heedless, back in the game now
Can't watch from the bleachers, I left CT soon as I was a senior
They insecure and they waiting on features
Blaming their friends, anything for a reason
Ain't gotta tweak if you really believe, keep my dream close

Hey!
Make way for the best when it takes all
Changing my ways let me break off
Not fazed by the days of the fake walls
No boundaries, let's take off
I'll digress, it's priceless
Swear I'm alive but I'm lifeless
Living in my brain washed up
Taking more than before feel the pain
I still take more than I can digest
But it ain't shit, still I'm blessed
School sucks, still I'm stressed
Add that to the fact that my friend hung himself
And his dad walked into him hangin' loose by a belt
That's fucked up, still I smile
Short-ass life, make it while
Some twist the weed, Some twist the vial
But I doubt that shit gonna make you smile
So fuck you, ask why I said it cuz I love you
And the breed is something that you must do
The mic is who I feel I should talk to
Cuz that shit don't really talk back
Hard thing cuz I don't need that
Cuz most you kids can't see that
I really couldn't care about the feedback
But I'll leave that alone
Gonna sit with these pants 'till I'm home
This world got my heart made of stone
But I'll mask it
Go cover your thoughts in plastic
Bet it won't shine
Could really use a minute, but got no time
Thoughts deep down like roll tide
But I bounce back up yeah I pass that shit like a road sign
So I stumble on, I ride the beats
Hole is a dream still incomplete
Cuz I'm not yet close where I need to be
Check the whole world, looking for some decency
Won't find it
Hard to navigate when you blinded
Stressed from the back like sirens
But I ain't gonna stop 'till the good Lord close my eyelids
And I'm ghost, I'm ghost, I'm ghost

Bruises
Breaking my bones but it's alright
She dig me up from the ruins
It's gonna be one more long night
Don't even know what I'm doing
Just know I'm not here for a long time
And I love you but it's confusing
I can't escape your influence
'Cause I can believe in anything
Like what about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh?
There's nothing to do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She does things to bug me
She says she don't love me
But

[Chorus]
I think she does (Yeah)
I think she does (Yeah)
I think too much (Yeah)
I think she does (Yеah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Just for the record you taking too long
My hеart is weak but the feeling is strong
What I look like with my head in my palms?
Can't get it right when the feeling is off
A day at a time I take it as it comes
It's time to slide but I cannot move on

Half of yall rappers ain't matched up when it comes to me
Stabilized flow the economy had to check this
Kill any beat have mercy when I wreck it
Fresher then Prince of Bel-aire freshest of the freshest
Will C. Smith had problems when I addressed this
I’m too real I should call it me authentic
Realer then Soulja Boy Tell Em’s Front Necklace
Listen really closley or get shaped up like Tetris
I’m madder than emo kid stuck on depression
Harder than preeteen kid with an erection
Pay close attention like this was Math Testin
Some same I’m too weak now its time to be aggresive
I’m at staple center askin where Ron Artest is?
Heart of a champion Muhammed Ali flow
Bring a lot of hits, wait rewind that like TiVo

I’m a cannibal, yup its understandable
Bars stay hot to these rappers i’m intangible
Be extra cautious, this song is really flammable
Crazy like a homeless man, I’m super radical
I'm risin to the top, oppopsite of Titanic
Like Pamela Anderson chest I’m gigantic
Eatin Mc’s off my fingers tips like dorritos
Hotter than jalepenos dipped in tapatillo
Leave these rappers quite like NBA home teams and a free throw

Got what it takes they still don't believe
But know I got a couple tricks up my sleeve
High like the seats on a rover
This is life bro I sleep when its over
Have a little bit of weed with the cobra

Hey... yeah... sounds good, nice and jazzy, just the way I like it... uh, check it out now

[Verse 1]
These days lately got me stuck up in a conscious coma
Mad hazy but still rolling like a walking stroller
My life is just beginning, the world is mine for takin'
So find me living right, summer night, take some bacon
My boys rolling too, freestyling with my crew
I'm not saying this shit's old, but it's nothing new
I'm bringing plus signs, you uptight, I'm untied
I spit till I'm tongue-tied, and bask in the sunshine in July
The rain is over for the moment
I've been digging in the crates, smacking the shit out of opponents
Rocking tanks on the daily, the pumps with some ears
Giving daps to the homies, this is simply how I live, fuck the drama
We got some little mamas, got my boys too
See you bring that negativity so I avoid you
Stay smiling all night, really I ain't trippin
Got them bars like I'm in prison, I'm just happy that I'm livin all love

[Hook 1]
Don't waste my time and saying ""how you been, Fel?""
Man, I'm feelin fine
I keep a plus sign, I like to live slow
I love the sunshine, and I wanna die, oh
So I say it's all love
Don't waste my time and saying ""how you been, Fel?""

Say, you been putting on some weight?
You better quit your bitin'
I'm feeling so enlightened
Hoping September never hits
Yo, I like living in the days where you just can't remember shit in the moment
You got some broken focus, change your angle
Mad at me cause I ain't got no ice but still I dangle
Scoping out my prospects and focus on the pros
Make some money off these beats and now my pocket's got some holes but I'm rollin'
The beat tape bumping while I'm drivin'
Started as a kid and never thought I'd still be rhymin'
Funny how it is and still I play it right
Mama send a text, ""It's too loud!"" when I play at night
This is my medicinal, y'all the hypocritical
Type that make me wonder how this pretty world turned pitiful
Still, I watch them city girls looking so fine
Found me chirping at your man even though you're not mine -gotta say it's all love

[Hook 2]
Won't waste your time, and saying ""how you been, Fel?""

Ayo I woke up this morning, pissed off as usual
Hit the snooze button thinking I should plan my funeral
I spend too many nights getting bent up in my cubicle
But still got the spark to make a death look beautiful
Wasted
Looking at these faces in my basement
Playing Miles Davis while my heartbeat races
Used to try relaxin but then that shit made me anxious
Done a lot of practice with going through changes
Freestyles and vape hits
Bump as the base hits
Spinning in my desk chair
Lighting up like Vegas
Getting in their faces to make 'em jab back
They say ""fuck you""
I hit the mic and say ""fuck you"" right back
This is all part of the plan
You think I'm shooting blind
You better understand
I see right through your lies
I'm going for the grand
I'm talkin' 'bout the prize
Cause accomplishment does much more than money in my eyes
You can keep on, keep on, keep on doubtin'
Saying I should stick to this computer screen mouthin'
Thanks for the advice but homie truthfully you vouchin'
Every time you say my name I'm climbing up a mountain
Tripping
It's nothing new what's up with you, nada
Last time I checked I was spottin' you dollars
See me at your party and you say ""what's up holla""
Then I get to work
You be talking shit behind my collar
Psilocybin in my brainwaves
Spewing shit like AK's
Guy the type to make out with a dude and say you hate gays
Faker than an overseas e-mail payday

Ay ay Term K, Acumental what up
We should go three on a dutch
From CT to Chi-town
Yeah you know it's all love
Now take the mic from my hand cause you know that I'm good

[Verse 2: Acumental]
Yo I shriek I scream I screech I holler
I'm sleek I'm keen I'm bleak I'm somber
Chief my weed and drink my lager
Speaking Greek I'm freaking out
So turn the speakers louder
You can't handle the noise
Bag a damsel then I rap until her panties are moist
Fans handing me joints, cannabinoids
Yo it's Felly, Acumental and Term so clap your hands and rejoice
Party people sip potion
Keep the spliff roasting
Think so deep felt cerebral implosion
Fingertips frozen
Corpse like ignorance of foresight
Seem to move in synchronous motion
Need to get dough so I throw a pair of dice around
Make your ears bleed like the Holyfield-Tyson bout
I'm on mic (Mike!)
Hold it real tight and shout loudly
Acumental like his crowd rowdy
Black lung keep a fresh pack in the freezer
P Square hop on the track till my knees hurt
Good hustle like slap on the keister
Rapping to beats in my slacks and a t-shirt
I feel huge
Surreal views
A real scrooge you can ask Ebenezer
Find me trashed in the back of a beamer
The yak-sippin' cat with the rancid demeanor
[Verse 3: Term K]
Make it pop like a weazel or a jack-in-the-box
Unless you're not quite feeling it just ask me to stop
Actually it happens a lot
So I just sit in one spot and puff pot till my back is in knots
I want the dollars and fame
I want a profit and gain
I wanna bow as crowds howling my name, wait
This ganja's insane
Clotting my brain
I think he called it the andromeda strain, dang
Lifting coffin lids with a crowbar
I'm living off the grid mixing soap bars
Every project is mayhem
You may have made a profit if your squad had a game plan
Lost in a wasteland
The prodigal son's parable
Often compared to the vault of safe-cracker
Magical flow, the squad's performing miracles
Travel the globe, the obstacle course is spherical
You can shout but nobody's hearing you
Downtrodden on the outside and I'm peering through
All for none notice yet known to come closest
Home with a cold one, smoking blunt roaches
Born branded and scarred
A cannibal starving
And standing his guard in a firestorm
Only tryna form a tangible argument
Or plan for disarmament
And solely by having a heart that provided it for him

Let's get right in
Eyes low, dropping soul like the Gospel
Been there for a minute, eating breaks but I'm not full
No, No, I'm on that other
I spend some of these days feeling strange and my brothers And feelin' little ill, trying to cope with the bandit
I just wanna move but my license is suspended
So what am I to do, You expecting me to peddle
Instead of in my room trying to get this brain settled
Been filling up them pages 'til the point I wanna flip
But I kick shit, like kick flips, you can't touch my tricks
Sorry for the facts, I just wanna keep that clear
Got love for the homies, say they bump me when they steer
And I never wanna anger, that shit simply came
Cuz people talking shit, because they I want their, fame
But I just want to kick it, y'all don't see me as a threat
I'm happy when I'm spitting, and I only want respect
And that is all I ask, put some rays in the volume
Take off your mask, we all seeing through your costume
I'm gonna serve rap, 'til my vocal chords break
Still staying in my lane, see you riding in my wake
Mama promised, I'm gonna wreak havoc
On track, speak madness
The facts, homies think they nice
But the speech average, at best
I dangle lines and I strangle lines
Never wanna waste my time
Bringing out this drama with this book of rhymes
So when you talk shit and end up in a gutter
I'll be chillin' on a boat and livin' right, cuz it's summer
Feeling hazy, still got time to twist with you benders
Cuz I'm been killing shit since the 2nd of September
And 9, 5, 9, 5, comin' up like high tide
Ain't seeing much tonight
I'll probably have my eyes wide
And my plan, I don't know
Goin' crazy, yea for sure
Got to get in where I fit in, watch me motherfucking grow
Y'all some parasites
Shootin' at my paradise
'Bout to grip the top, best believe that I ain't scared of heights
I've died dropping, I'll down a couple hot pockets
And if you can't see it's dope, check your eye sockets
And I'm ghost, and I'm ghost, and I'm ghost, and I
I got you motherfuckers hangin' by a rope and I
Never really meant to brag or to boast, but I
I think you gotta
When you kicking it this dope brotha
Uh-uh, uh-uh, Tell me that it's not true
Y'all that type that brag about

Throw it
Fire out back
Planes up there ya keep this shit wet
If I die today, I'm still on track
Halloween chain, it's a big old bat
Six tours in I've been 'round the map
Can't fuck with shorty if she actin' like that
Cool ice cubes I feel like Mike
Try to vacay, I'm still on the mic
Ooh, you see the bright lights
Out in Miami just to see wildlife
Pullin' these hoes, just me and Limbani
It's like a campaign we got 10 big bodies
Yes, if I die today
Least I'm with the gang in a hideaway
No stress
Imma find a way
Thank that we the same, but it's night and day

[Chorus: Felly & Gyyps]
What should I do?
Hold up, strong, that shit too strong
I cannot move
Let's keep shit short, can't take too long
Counting up blues
My momma done prayed, my momma done prayed
Got nothin' to lose
Won't go out that way, won't go out that way

You alrеady know that I do that
I can show you how to do that
They gon' call this shit a throwback
She got a gut she can throw that
Hеr pussy gushin', it's so wet, it's drippin' on top of my forehead
Push it to go, racks on me like that 4 wheel
Pack up and send off the merch in the slow mail
I learned some tennis from kids who own Kodak
Bitches on bitches on
My lap like Christmas like noelle
I am not passing my chips or my cheddar no rotelle
My shit is gigantic, my room got the hammock and this is no motel
Pray my dope sell

[Bridge: Felly]
Planned it, Pink showed the beat it was jammin'
Two weeks I'll be in the Hamptons
I got the Bronco to take a bitch camping
Yes, I got standards
Like it's so expensive
Imma need my percentage
Foot on the gas I press it
I'm high like twin peaks, mind going three peat, just taste test don't repeat
I watch what matters to me
I wish that hoe ain't tattle on me
[Chorus: Felly & Gyyps]
What should I do?
Hold up, strong, that shit too strong
I cannot move
Let's keep shit short, can't take too long
Counting up blues
My momma done prayed, my momma done prayed
Got nothin' to lose
Won't go out that way, won't go out that way

Yes, fire out back

Yo these people talk to me like I'm a listen
You love feedin me that dirt, let me do the dishes
The download is out and you can check the digits
I been on my sun shit, yesterday i crossed some fishes
And it was delicious probably cause my eyes low
Cops at house parties keep me runnin from the 5-0
Caught skippin' class but mama got me by the spinal
Dismissin' me from school so i can go and cop some vinal
Word
Its all wins, no losses, but stop fucking hittin up my phone its obnoxious
Most my days I spent making beats to fill my pockets
So I can buy some shit I probably never even wanted
But still I can fuck around and take the throne
I made almost a grand with just a day while I was home alone
Getting big headed and I hate it more than you can know
But damn it feels good to show these kids that like to doubt my goals
Mama i put you in the beama, I love you more than I can fit up in this meter(?)
Pops I ain't forget yuh though I'm standing underneath yuh
Im sorry if i ain't livin' up to promises between us
Damn
My innersense gone AWOL, sippin on a 40 while we listenin to the rain fall
They placin' bets on if i fail, but I'm take off
Kick those fuckers down while they swinging at my ankles
Embrace the thought provoking adolescence
I swear ill make the world feel every sentence
But now i just smile... kinda like this

Don't get ahead of yourself
You know how things stay sometimes
So don't go hurting yourself
You only trapped in your mind (That's right)
We've got a story to tell
Just have it written on the lines
Don't say that nothing will help
Sometimes I cry (yeah), I cry (yeah), I cry, I cry

[Verse 1]
Got a world full of hurt waitin' outside
And it's waitin' on me
Feel the burn as I wait 'til the outcry
Not to mention the heat
Live again in the shoes of a black mind, it can't happen to me
Look around for the truth, it's an out lie
And that fuck up my peace
I got friends who famous, I got friends who ain't, shit
I got girls with grudges who still won't say shit
I know some white folks who ain't keen on changin'
Summon God home as the sun on vacation
Don't take too long, cause we'll be here waitin'
Started feelin' guilty when I felt amazin'
If I'm part of the problem, then it's complicated
If I could point a finger, it'd probably be at Satan
Or whoever raised them but, me
But we like impatience
Summer's gone and I miss the fragrance
They sellin' souls just to get on playlists

Heard another friend out know that life precious
Thinking that my mind fucked up, still, I flex it
Leave it to the universe and people get me

We don't need pesos open up them legs bitch
Far from your regular, my pops blessed me
Walking up them stepping stones up to heaven
8 months of unopened mail on the dresser
Ain't seen the sun I been pale it's my last semester
Jerry thinking that the demons got me
Heard him speaking 'bout me, think I need the audi
If you wanna know how I feel about it
Know the feeling sour cause I feel the power
Far from your regular, something about something about secular
You ain't really got the gas, if you stash love
I fucking with her till she pregnant
And sometimes I wanna see it like Ken Lammar
I just think God is someone been in charge
Cause I can never stay the whole seminar

I'm off that, running through the stage in a top hat
Yeah they gonna hate, coulda called that
Once you get on, then I'm off that
Shoulda be gone but my car crashed
But now I'm more alive than before
This shit ain't the same no more (no no)
360 spin and I'm told, in the black xl after show
With a bunch of young kids
Tryna take photos, my low
With a long road ahead, no weed
On the plane 5 days of the week
Can't wait to get home and just chill
Never thought this would be the deal, so ill
And we bout it erryday, erryday, erryday
Fuck what anybody say, I lay awake with the AK
227 be the name, and praise J
She been down since banged the basement
A no show to your after party
I don't feel like I gotta be somebody
Been thinking too much, and feeling hardly
Still the dirt bike feel like Harley
I'm four finger type golden (gold)
One late night and I told her
I was lit and out with my homies
Like damn it's time to get focused
What it got' take to get out this here coma
Who you gonna lay when the show all over
Made a 100k just to label me a stoner
Cool cuz I'm still blowing Doja
Still on the move, Daytona
Still don't feel like cold world
Still don't feel like cold world
Still, Still, Still, Still sold out in Minnesota
Hol' Up, young girl so appealing
She look me right in the eyes
She told me ""You Can't fight this feeling""
Said ""You ain't gotta try""

Look into my eyes
Tell me what do you see, you see
I’m looking in your mind
And i’m looking for me, for me (x2)

[Verse 1 ]
Pray to god and i roll out
Low profile restless i feel like my old style
Debt collectors they owe now!
Down in so cal, you would expect that i’d slow down!
But that might be a problem
Tell mama we the wrong role models
Heaven gone stick us up
Spent too much time not giving fucks now the jig is up
I stay twisting up, skate on thin ice but i kiss the cup
Yo listen up i’m ‘bout to bounce with a million plus and keep going
And when she asked if i rap yo i said fuck that, i’m a poet y’all just go with the motions like
Oh damn, running around the house with no pants, cooking on maschine that’s my program
Been trying to advance so when shit hits the fan i can sit in the sand with my toes in
I feel chosen
Rastafari yeah smokin’
I ain't tryna hear none of yo bullshit
Son i just came back from the ocean!
Like oh shit!!!
Move that language round so blasé
Y’all ain’t gon’ fly with my posse
So keep yo’ distance compadre
I got to-do lists, i got laundry
You distracting looking like a barbie
And i just wanna twist up, maybe parlay
Come fix me up  it’s been a long day

I shed a tear for a friend I'll never get to see again
And I drove the 20 minutes to the ocean
Started laughing at the magic
That comes along with something tragic
Man I'll see you again once I get where I'm going
Shared smoke with a crowd
Went up the coast I'm northern bound
Then I rode all the horses out in Austin (Yeah, yeah)
Seems I'm walking to my coffin
Kiss the girls to keep from talking
Bought a gun and I'm not sure what I'm hunting
So l asked for words of wisdom from my grandma with dementia
She got halfway through and said ""I can't remember""
Sip of whiskey by the fire
Lеt the tall trees be my choir
Wherе it's quiet enough to hear my hearts desires

[Chorus]
Nothing hurts anymore
And my eyes are dry
If it works let it pour
No tears left to cry
No tears left to cry

Then a woman of 6 years reappeared and kept me comfort
And I held on like a baby to its mother
And her love was so complete, I felt my secrets at the surface
I said thank you but I really don't deserve this
It was enough just for that moment
It'Il vanish when you hold it
Played the college but I'm dying with the poets
Now its deep breaths from my stomach
It complies with reluctance
Just in time to catch the tail end of summer

[Chorus]
Nothing hurts anymore
And my eyes are dry
If it works let it pour
No tears left to cry
No tears left to cry

And all this science that I don't understand
Asking how are you so sure that ill see you again
We don't know where we're going but I can't pretend
I miss my friend I wish that I had some tears left

But my eyes are dry

I learned from the past but I'm far from finished
I rose from the ash, I'm smokin' on killer
The truth is attached, they wanna conceal it

Big up the bag but cry me a river
Yo take off them tags, my spirit Margiela
I'm readin' Ram Dass, I'm bumpin' Griselda (Do what thou wilt)
Your body ain't built like this, Scottsdale with a filth light bitch
I smell like guilt, shit get real Irish when I move to the mountains but I'm knee-deep like kill
Walk through the valley of death, with a cross on my neck, man, I gotta stand tall like stilt
She wanna fuck up my head, imma paint em' all red, I jump in that -- and I melt
Pen Lord Byron, Bamboo sheets still wake up the siren, shawty a siren
Swinging that cannon
I've been on deck like a pirate
Gotta be brutally honest, okay
We just arrivin', give me my roses and I'ma start firin'
Everything sunny but I ain't been smilin'
Countin' this money and duckin' the virus
The comfort zone don't exist
Don't even like to reminisce, timeless, I dicthed the wrist watch
Grew up quick, friends call me Big Shot
Life changed since I put down the fisheye
Damn, don't get too woke, you gon' fumble the bag
More that I know its the less I should ask

[Verse 1: Felly]
Everyday feels so mundane
Days drag on, nights the same, spent my time, in my brain
Walk around still feel so strange
Raise your cups, pray for us, pray for luck
No time [?]
Morning gloom when I'm waking up
With those clouds coming, cold out
Hold it down y'all sold out
I wish you well and nothing less
Take a few days off go ease that stress
My life gulps vanity, lost my sanity, miss my family
Losing hope how can it be so cold?
So cold?
So cold?
So cold?
How can it be so cold?
So cold?
So cold?
So cold?
Now everyday black white
Don't know how to act right
Mind deep in the stress. On the run from the happiness
Well I get soaked up full with that vinyl
My only means of survival. So the question if I'm worth while. And I can't find shit in the bible no my faith low my days slow my room filled with that vape smoke
I lay low, gotta recoup
Swear to god everybody see-through
When I wake up and I can't move
Things to do but I hit snooze
Don't wanna go through what I been though
And the world I'm walking into is so cold
So cold
So cold
So cold
How can it be so cold?
So cold?
So cold?
So cold?
I don't think I can love no woman. I don't think I can stop my pushing. Every time I get close to a chick I just put 'em behind on my beats sayin' ""shit.""
They don't like that. She send a text I don't write back
There's something else I aspire to
She's fed up and I'm tired too
Yo I spent my nights tryna multiply
Working like the shit do or die
Unbalance life, either sick or fly
Like I'm in the dirt or I'm stupid high
Guess that's life that's just me. Restless don't trust me
Tough week, time will tell
Irony, cold as hell
How can it be so cold?
So cold?
So cold?
So cold?
How can it be so cold?
So cold?

[Verse]
Tears in my eyes in the back of a van
Know this country like the motherfuckin' back of my hand
Been on the road for six weeks when I heard we lost gramp
Couldn't make the funeral, I just hope he'd understand
Thirty days later, quiet house where I land
Stu' to the venue, goddamn I need a tan
Pop passed, brain cancer, was turnin' to a man
Wore a condom, still caught the burn, damn
The worst part was I wasn't thinking 'bout her
Back in my crib, stayin' loyal to her word
I apologize again T, I know that shit hurt
Karma gets served, least mine was well deserved (On God)
Finish my breakfast, pen a new sentence (Yeah)
Remember doin' shows, ten heads in attendance
Some people want fame, others want digits
Behind their insecurities, most just tryna fit in
Give it before I lose it
Just to show these kids that it's bigger than music
If you don't get it, you ain't meant to, stupid (Stupid)
Young Fel ruthless (Ayy)
Pen game make you wish you stayed in school
And I can do anything, it's a matter of what I choose
Try to put a genre on me, you gon' end up confused
I can serve raps, I can sing Blues
And for you pussies with the painted nails, I can Rock too (Ooh)
On to number two, I ain't got nothin' to lose
Bank account cool, been some months since I viewed
Independent roots, plus I did it with my crew
And they can't take the soul, livin' in the same shoes (Come on)
Seventeen, I was hungry for it
Twenty-something, back for more, enough of this back and forth (Shit)
Round the world, just to come back home
Was suicidal 'fore I ever got to know my soul, pssht

Few days at the bottom
On the top feel better, got a world full of problems
Hold me down, I escape the column
Pray to god, but I praise the dollar
I'm driftin' farther
From a brain that used to bother me constantly
Am I lit on right? and I properly spit prophecy
Better than I was the last time, reminiscin' on the pain of bad times
Throw a little jazz though phat rhymes
We washed up like bath time
Pack it up, this the shit you play when you had enough
Smokin' in the car, got a ash and cups
Feel soo sad, but I'm happy as fuck
Said I used to wanna be on the TV screens
Eazy- E, playin' on my walk, man, mp3
Tryna find a way to breath easy, but that shit won't happen
So I started rappin' to pass time and hopefully
In a few years I'll be globally
Recognized by those who feel dopamine
Every time I hit the mic, I spit soulfully

Cuz all my friends 'round here they roll their blunts
And I love to smoke, but get your goals and run

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm losing myself
Used to say I'd never love a women I'm too true to myself
But as of lately
Don't know what to do with myself
Falling in for this girl feeling stupid as hell
Cause look
I got bigger dreams as I'm texting
The whole damn night
That distorts my direction
And plus you steady stressing
I always leave you guessing
I'd sell you out to music in a second
And that's the problem with me
But still got people rocking with me
You see I'd rather hear the crowd than girls talking to me
It's a dream and you can't put a stopping on me
But look I met you at the airport you soon let me show
I was listening to records you was reading a book
We started talking, conversing
Liked you as a person
You was into art and I was thinking that's perfect
Chill for the next summer, and the next summer, and the next summer
And soon I had a fan base
Couldn't keep my hands straight
Recording shit while you would make me pancakes
Began to grow apart with my progress
Started telling me I treat you like an object
And I was looking at my prospects
Dealing with the nonsense
Couldn't really see you in my process
Now you say I'm selling out for my status
But it isn't my fault that we had to lose the balance
So before you call me fake and see through
Relax lil' ma let's just do what we do

Before rap was sellin' piff

Let me talk my shit, touch an M and I still don't feel shit
I need stems 'cause you know that shit hit
Ditch this town in a six speed
Askin' my advice? Follow your dreams

[Verse 1]
Okay, my mind was in the gutter, I was slumped for a bit
Didn't think I'd find another quite like you, and I still ain't yet
But back then they talked down and I did it (You ain't even got a plaque yet!)
Just know I ain't finished
It's funny how life switched up from a gray space
It's all in your head, ain't no place you could vacay
And she just want somebody she can talk to, a safe space
And I just hope that check in my bank by daybreak
People talkin' shit, oh my, the grapevine thickens
Don't pay 'еm no attention, I just give 'em my bеst wishes
No wonder everybody walking 'round with trust issues
How you got no friends to reps, still set trippin'
G-Money throw the beat on and I'm sendin' the death wishes
Somebody turn the heat up or something? my sweat drippin'
Did it independent, but just signed for seven digits
And I just took my shawty on vacation, she still bitching

Alright, alright, let's go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, something real, my heart's on sale, ain't hurt nobody
But I still, can't get my fill, I wanna party
And my ex, casting spells, 'til I'm not sorry
All my tats, trace the years, upon my body
Bumpin' heads, my heart goes out to everybody
See their stares and I know deep down
That they could probably use an ear
And not someone to judge 'em like they do in the mirror
And show 'em how to stop livin' in fear
Cut my dreams short, too far-fetched
Now you next, the woadie
Back and forth with the same bullshit
But you know I keep some hope wit' a flow like this
These days, baby, I need more than sex
The beats is digital, bad bitches gettin' low
Rich homies gettin' woke
Oh, so now you spiritual?
Shouts to Black [?] on gettin' me that critical advice that I needed
Most of y'all too defensive to receive it

[Bridge]
Talkin' to myself, and it's got a lot to do
With me being me, and you being you
I got a lot of bread and I got a lot of hoes
So I ain't worried if my heart got some holes
She gettin' off work, so I wait 'til they close
Just to pick her up and ask her how her day go
We can anywhere, just don't take me home
And the city's so big, never felt so alone
With a love like this, girl we'll never go broke
In a whip this clean, I ain't never need soap
Know that this my path I keep seeing fourfolds
Know that this my path I keep seeing fourfolds

And by the way, I hope that we fuck tonight
I'm sick of wakin' up, feeling like nothing's right
I pray to god, something like every night
That we make it happen, and my people come to life
I'm supposed to be on tour, instead I be wearing a mask
Added to the mask that I was wearing, I'm gone in a flash
The good news is, good things don't come fast
So keep goin' forward, cause you can't look back
You know that

[Outro]
Talkin' to myself
Thinkin' what do I know
Nothin' ever helps
Everything is goin' fine, though
These days I do my best not to hurt nobody
These days I get so depressed tryna be somebody
Yeah (Something real, something real, something real, something real, something real, something real, something real, something real, something real)

Rest up at the rest up
Slow into the evening
Watch out for the hornets
Like to sting you for no reason
Halley's got a comet
New Orlean's got some demons
Running out of money
Working on the weekends

My mama, she acts how she does
So l fear who I might become
My daddy, he died when we were young
Turned me to one lonely son of a gun, let's have some fun
Come on

[Chorus]
Dance with me
This your chance, this your chance
Put your hands on me
Make it last, make it last

[Verse 2]
Everything's connected
A force that keeps us beating
Still all feel rejected
Hiding in our secrets
Waking up to thunder
The comedown is misleading
Talking down the darkness
Oh, so hard to leave it

Guess these pills don't work no more

Laid in bed for an hour, the I got to recording
And I been lookin' out for you
Because I like the way you groove
And how you always down to come through
I'm leaving for the west coast
My brothers said ""get busy stacking, or gone get broke""
And so I'm leaving with a dream
And my beats maschine
Miles away form my team
But when I come back
We got' kick it with ease
For now I'm riding' solo
Cop the merch, Now who down to fill my promo
I'm moving slow, I spent the whole day sleeping
Partied the whole weekend
But I swear I'll be okay
Even yo momma she be tweakin'
I got out from school, 2 o'clock
Cruised a little, burned a lot
High School shit lot cooler now
Prom dates be like ""who you got?""
Like, whoop, I'm getting high to fight [?]
Put me in the water, Imma roll like this shit Canary
Come and join our family, (uh huh)
And feel this rhyme and most I see is uninspiring
Still I wake up and I'm grindin'
I got that sunshine in my head
Sometimes growing up get's cold
I rock my brothers threads
I'm taking corners quick in my Mazda
Penne alla vodka, Jamie used to dress me up
And Matty was my poppa
Got me thanking God for everything we been through
And when I'm gone, best believe I'm gone' miss you

2423924,Felly,Splurge,"3 ContributorsSplurge Lyrics[Verse]
If I could tell you how I really felt, well I really probably wouldn't
At the bottom of the bucket, got and bought some shit I shouldn't
And now I'm feeling crooked and my money is spent
Saved up for happiness but I was short by a cent
So I splurged, I couldn't find the words to express
Running circles in my mind till that shit was out of breath
And I just want to feel content but I won't
Cause all this pressure got me tight by the throat
It's just another long night, got home and laughed
Cause driving home going ninety almost crashed
At least someone's got my back, I like to think that it's my father looking down
Pardon my stupidity, I'll come around
And find my way up, back up on my feet, maybe catch peace
Get a little bit of sleep
Cause in these troubled times we all looking for some solace
Mama's getting worried, I'ma be fine, I promise
It's hard to keep that hope when you staring at reality
Cause what's real is working nights for your salary
That rough shit in free time gets me thinking
No wonder everybody smoking herb and drinking
When winter comes I'll fold up freeze with the cold
Those dark months in the state are getting old
Maintaining my hope with a focus on the real
Put everything in music so don't ask me how I feel
I used to want to grow up, and now I want to grow down
A fast life always ends in a slow down
And holding to the hope is the everyday struggle
Just want to break free from this everyday bubble
I dream a new life and some complex shit
I'm more than what you heard on my compact disc
Can't slip, gotta grip to what I truly desire
But trying to finding happiness is making me tired

So I tell it like it is
I'm just a kid
I don't want to end up the way that you did
I got some bigger dreams that a sleep can't give
I'd rather have a smile than a big mansion

And all you wanna do is listen to that song
And what do you—, what do you do with that tune?
Do you hang on and listen to the ramblings of a broken version
Or do you shift to die and listen to something else that you don't necessarily rock with as much?

No I mean I know all the theory behind music but

Hayden bro can you turn on the fan for me please

I think equally important

Nah you gotta turn the switch I'm sorry bro

I think equally important is learning how to forget everything you know

Yes but you have to learn everything first

You, I mean you don't have to but, I mean there are great musicians who cant even read music you know

No but you have, I don't mean you have to learn how to read music I just mean you have to learn how to speak the language

Yeah but I think that you just learn from experience

I love putting it like that too speak the language is all you gotta say bro

You have to be able to speak the same language and it depends on how fluent you are in that language
You know the more skills like you know on an instrument or in a specific aspect the better you can speak that language
And that's the reason we're doing all this music is just to speak with other people to reach out to people

I gotta go harder
I gotta go find me the energy that I first started with
I gotta go slower, I gotta relax
And sit back and embrace my accomplishments

I gotta give more
I’m selfish in all that I take for the sake of abundentness
I gotta get more I don’t have enough
And shit lately I'm feeling anonymous

Can never be sure
I’m certain of that
I’m so insecure
And so confident

I need me a girl
Who let me have girls
On second thought
I'll be monogamous

The thing with this world
It's like nothing matters
But everything come with a consequence
I need to be woke
But then I go drink and get thrown until I get incompetent

My life is a lie
My bitch is a 10

I’m better alone
I could use a friend
I need to express
They don’t understand

I need to kill my desires
The buddha man said that’s the reason I’m suffering
I need a routine, a structure
My life is so fucking monotonous

I need me a God
I need me a devil

Nothing is wrong
I don’t know what problem is …

Watch out for facades
Handshakes and head nods

Try to do it like Me

Holding your hand, you stay patient
You're free and easy, quick and painless
I don't believe it 'cause I need a reason
Saying, ""Ha, ha""
We laugh it off until we cry
'Cause it's a short life
You remind me all the time
You told me
""Whatever comes, whatever comes, let it come my way
Whatever comes, whatever comes, let it come my way""

Count your blessings first, then play the cards you're dealt

What's wrong? I'ma miss you when you're gone
And it's so wrong to have to move on from someone you love
To get where you're going

Hey! It's a beautiful day
Don't you wait for a lifetime
To watch it all slip away

[Verse]
Still with the same squad
Came to turn the place on
Ice like a face off
Something’s gotta change, huh
Staring at the same sky
With the same two eyes
That I had my whole life
I just hope they see more than what’s here
Cause sometimes, it can make the soul cry
When I can’t see no light
Reminded I’m a gold mine
They keep telling mo' lies
Trying to demoralize
Waiting on the sunrise
No woman, no cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Like my my, my my
Trying to hold on tight while the hands of time
Are slipping by by, by by
But the futures looking bright
If you open up your eyes

Don’t you wait for a lifetime

And I said hey (hey)

Take a walk on the wild side
Let your heart lead the way
Let your heart say hey (hey)

[Verse]
There’s a place for people like you and me
Where the living come easy and the loving is free
And there’s no limitations on what you can be
Still we struggle for a peace of mind
It’s hard to read between the lines
Paint like I'm Van Gogh
Head with a halo
Still chasing rainbows
But don’t forget your raincoat
Born into a broken home
It turned me to a rolling stone
I can’t judge to each his own
Whatever keeps you keeping on, like
