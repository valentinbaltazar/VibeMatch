The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you, yeah

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2]
But I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

[Chorus]
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find you and I collide

It's enough just to find love
It's the only thing to be sure of
So hard to let go of

1062292,Howie Day,Be There,"2 ContributorsBe There LyricsWhen the morning came I was up before first light
And your bed was made, must've cut out sometime last night
My heart beat started pounding out rhythm in my brain
A voice from deep inside said you've got to be insane
Everyone knows how this old story goes
So I got in that taxi; drank my conscience away

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight
Start livin', out with the old, I'm all lit up
Must be the good life

I went to your friends house and begged you to open the door
With your hands on your hips you spoke while I sat down on that floor
Two dishes in the kitchen sink, the way you treat me when you drink
You don't look so superior when you give your opinion

And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then, I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

But why give up your love

We were dead set on makin' it last forever, forever and a day
I recall it was fall last year when, it started to die
You stand still as the temperature kills, the summer strokes that were keeping it alive
The day got colder so I held you closer, in an effort to save us from time
Almost like the wind came and ruined the spark and left us in the dark

But hey- I coulda told you that I loved you and stay
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late
On my return and now you've lost all faith
And I am a liar
I'm no longer what you require

See, I still feel you at night, turning in the sheets when I turn out the light
It's how it goes, the ghost of your first love won't ever leave you til the day that you die
I won't ever live down leaving her behind even if the choice was the right one
It was a good thing staring me right in the face but I turned and ran away

I coulda told you that I loved you and stay
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late
On my return and now you've lost all faith
Cause I am a liar
I'm no longer what you require

Back then the days were so much faster
We were young stubborn and in love with disaster
You know you can't go back even if you try
You better just forget it won't you close the door on me
Cause it will never be the same
It will never be the way it was before

While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and reliefHey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
Don't ever let them winSee Howie Day LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also likeEmbed",1,/songs/1224655,Don't Dream It's Over by Howie Day,https://images.genius.com/51a39d4a387cded90f49fe37953f319b.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/51a39d4a387cded90f49fe37953f319b.497x497x1.jpg,1549345,complete,/Howie-day-dont-dream-its-over-lyrics,,https://images.genius.com/51a39d4a387cded90f49fe37953f319b.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/51a39d4a387cded90f49fe37953f319b.497x497x1.jpg,Don't Dream It's Over,https://genius.com/Howie-day-dont-dream-its-over-lyrics,/albums/318459,https://images.genius.com/51a39d4a387cded90f49fe37953f319b.497x497x1.jpg,Live From... by Howie Day,318459.0,Live From...,2005,https://genius.com/albums/Howie-day/Live-from

Come lay down at the feet of angels
Eyeing you in a northern sky

Come lay down at the end
Come lay down where the times suspended
Come lay down and and hear the voices
Calling you from a northern sky

Follow me and don't look down
You're alright
Come with me, forget you're high
It's alright in all

Your eyes are open and singing
Your eyes are open
And not quite breathing
Your eyes are open

But we had ourselves
And wanted more
We drew in the starry night
Lit by firelight
'Til it came ashore

I know love is never lost
'Cos every motion has its cost
Even oceans turn to dust
I know love is never lost

Then a collective dream
Made of smoke and screens
Took us town to town
Once we were so afraid
When the bases changed
Buried in the ground

I know love is never lost
'Cos every motion has its cost
Even oceans turn to dust
I know love is never lost

Now, when the silence comes
And the work is done
Can we hear the sound
We can 'cos we're off in space
In a tiny place
That we made our own

You were the razor and balloon
So when I opened up my eyes on the hillside
I see the light as it shines from the moon

Breaking off the branches
Fighting off the sadness
Taking on the madness
For you

There's an angle on your face that I can't shake
Cause I'm a figure and a fool for you
And there's a moment that we've made, now we can't change it
See the light as it breaks through the room

Tracing all the patterns
Fusing all the atoms
Lighting up the lanterns
Letting go of all the lanterns

Till I wake up, boy I'll take some time to understand
Soon I'll be a part of this the last time
Oh, the last time, I'm sure it comes back on again

Somehow you find passing the time
Moving along to a different light
Lie on your back, oh you shoulder the blame
You can't find the time and you can't find your way home
You shout out

Till I wake up, boy I'll take some time to understand
Soon I'll be a part of this the last time
For the last time, I'm sure I'm coming back real soon

You're coming apart with me at the seams
We'll follow a man, says he lives in a dream
Well, you've been a part of everyone's style
Since the day you were born but now you need something more

There's an end to everything
I still feel you now
With salt sweat on your brow
You're Mexico in the sun
London in the rain
Morning that never comes
But I swear I saw everything

And there's a mad parade, dance and sing
And a nightmare comes for every king
When I see your face in the silver rain
I remind myself there's an end to things
I remind myself there's an end

The stars already dead
While their light remains a ghost
That flickers in our eyes
And outward from our skulls

Your body from the sun
Your heart is in the rain
The morning that never comes
But I swear I saw everything

And there's a mad parade, dance and sing
And a nightmare comes for every king
When I see your face in the silver rain

1774795,Howie Day,40 Hours,"2 Contributors40 Hours LyricsLately after dark I've been wandering through the park
With the angry words you said wandering through my head
There's nothing I can do to keep from feeling like I blew
The only chance I had to make it better

The shadow on the wall is looking down from 10 feet tall
And I wonder what it sees as I stumble through the streets
To never feel alone seemed written down in stone
But now it's all I can do to try and forget her

40 hours and counting
I could shut my eyes and sleep here

Morning comes and goes and I'm tangled in the throes
Of the stillness of my room and a bandage on my wound
My heart becomes a bird, she set free with just a word
And now I'm wishing that I had never met her

40 hours and counting
I could shut my eyes and sleep here

People rushing by out the corner of my eye
A kaleidoscope of blue, a mirror broke in two
A thousand little stars and a million little wars
Scattered out across the open desert

I shut my eyes and sleep here

My world is set ablaze by a never-ending haze
And you're closer than a tear, I see you ever clear
The rush is in the veins and there's nothing else to blame
But every minute, every hour, every second

40 hours and counting
I shut my eyes and sleep here
Shut my eyes and sleep to dream

Lately after dark I've been wandering through the park
With the angry words you said wandering through my head

No she wouldn't go for you
And she mixes up her albums
Cause she doesn't like that order you do
And she loves a second way
Hey, your first way is permanently through
And she'll never want to go to the movie
The same one that you do

And if this love is superstitious then everything we did is on call
And if this love is gonna make it then maybe i should turn it up

And the girl next door is cryin'
I dunno what i want to do
Nextdoor she's cryin'
Let me go, let me go for you

Well i watched as she moves from the bedroom to the living room floor
And i'll knock on her door and tell her what i've been waiting for
And she'll smack me upside the head, its a crazy scene
Save your best for your own, thats how i want it to be

And if this love is superstitious then everything we did is on call
And if this love is gonna make it then maybe i should turn it up

Well the girl next door is cryin'

I was staying up with you way too late
I thought someone like you
Could come around n make my faults
Seem like they were none at all
Come on somebody help me out
I'm underwater drowned in doubt

But it feels just like we're weightless
Weightless when we're together
Isn't it time to face it, what we already know?
Seems just like we fake it
Pretend it isn't happening
Pretend that it'll go away
Oh but what do I know?

It was all mixed up, ahead of the curve
When you were lying to the world
See I want to lie there too
Feeling down n all around
I see your back in every town
You'll be the one to hold me down
Tell me, is it too late now?

Because it feels just like we're weightless
Weightless when we're together

You come out the hard way, don't you?
Is there nothing left to say
When it's 4am and the morning's calling?

For once in your life
You were born, you will die
Make peace
Make peace

I see you woman alone in a canyon
I hear a woman cry tears from her eyes
But is it raining in West Memphis?
Is it raining in West Memphis, tell me?

For once in your life
You were born, you will die
For once in your life
Make peace

Say goodbye to what you thought it was wrong
Say hello to the wolves at your door
You are not alone, there's a crowd of us wandering
The same road you're walking and I lead and you follow

For once in your life
So for once in your life
Cause we were born starry eyed, you and I

Now the tables have turned, it's our memories instead

Maybe you're gone forever, some other time
You're somewhere across the great divide

Carried all the way to heaven
I know I've been wrong before
Carried all the way to heaven
Maybe there's a way to the heart of my desire for a ceasefire

All I wanted to say were the thoughts running through my head
Now the lesson is learned everything remains unsaid
Now that you're gone, yesterdays can leave me alone
Just a feeling of losing all control

You're carried all the way to heaven
You know I've been wrong before
Carried all the way to heaven
Maybe there's a way to the heart of my desire for a ceasefire

Maybe I'm ordinary, maybe I'm not
Somehow you have to carry on in your heart

Oh.. come on.. no .. come on..

High in the canyon we can both disappear
Got a change of reason, yeah this much is clear
Can you help me get back, back to the place

Gotta leave this feeling and all I can say

You’re like a miracle drug in the morning love
That keeps me moving on
You’re like a summer rain, something I just can’t explain

She left it up to fate
Standing at a phone, oh

And she knows what she wants
And she came here to take it
How perfect it could be you and me

And she met him at the door
I don't want you anymore
Remember what you said

You and a promise
You and a promise
You

You tell me he didn't wait
He walked right through the gate
So glad to be alone

And he knows who to call
I'll always be there for you
Call me anytime

I don't mean to offend
The voice on the other end
Is a stranger to me

Thinking how it all went wrong
Yesterday your world was fine
But now I'm fighting off the cold
The pitter patter of the snow

Sitting waiting for the flood
Open windows, open doors
Well I'm not scared of what I love
If it's what you hate me for
Stop the battle (???) of how we know

We're all trying to find
A light in the dark
Keep on searching for our place
We're all trying to find
A light in the dark
Well it's time we find a way
To burn the torches

Sipping coffee in the night
Thinking how it all went wrong
Yesterday your world was fine

Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll can never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the tv page

Hey now, hey now don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief
