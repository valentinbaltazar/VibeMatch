As my bones grew thеy did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to havе a father
But instead, I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore

It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing
That you're only supposed to use once and then discard
Where do you put it? In the garbage can, my honest friend
My shyness, pet her flow

Even though we haven't had sex for a week
A meal a day, a meal, I say
And my heart's made, my—

[Verse 2]
Somebody else already used the word 'aurora borealis'
She was tied up in chains, and Sam had helped her in the freezer

But I haven't had a date forever

More opportunity
More chances to remember some things
So I couldn't have so much pressure on my—

You're—personally responsible for
The entire strip to be washed away
Cleansed, as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol
Flowed through the strip and were set on fire

And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom
And his silk
And he—
He erected a beautiful city
A city of stars

Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge

If she floats then she is not
A witch like we’ve thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot

They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a sister
But instead, I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore

I'll start this off without any words
I got so high, I scratched 'til I bled
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Verse 2]
My brother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I tryin' to say?

[Verse 3]
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
When I'm done, and I can go home
Love myself better than you
Know it's wrong, so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

Afraid of never knowing fear

One baby to another says, ""I'm lucky to have met you""
I don't care what you think unless it's about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[Verse 2]
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

Oh no, not me

You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone

Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers, and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills, and shake the many hands

[Chorus]
Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words

[Verse 2]
When you've finished with the mop, then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work, it was fun

[Chorus]
Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words

[Verse 3]
Many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
Some say it was Greenland, and some say Mexico
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon

They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry

Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

Lyrics[Intro]
Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening
What is it?
This was written by (what?) my favorite performer. Our favorite perfomer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
Oh and here's a donation basket for one supply of Leadbelly's guitar
Oh yeah, this guy representing the Leadbelly's estate wants to sell me Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000
Passing a basket
Yeah, I even asked David Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me. He wouldn't do it

[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 3]
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

OK, that's where I'm having trouble, because...
No, let's just do it once, because...
The problem that I'm having is that I'm so used to going all the way through and then starting by myself
Okay, so we do it once before you start singing?
The problem is that I'm just not used to hearing Pat do that one chord thing
One more time
(Oops)

[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
Made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
For all the millions here
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

(Mmm)
What's your name?
Do you like me?

[Verse 1]
Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns

[Chorus]
What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?

[Verse 2]
Nothing to do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got

Second-rate third degree burns

It's so relieving to know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
Startin' to sound the same

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in bein' sad
I miss the comfort in bein' sad
I miss the comfort in bein' sad
Ad, hey

[Verse 2]
In her false witness, hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient, a display of patience
Disease-covered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire to burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in bein' sad

As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

[Verse 2]
In her false witness, hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient, a display of patience
Disease-covered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire to burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad

I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of ""Your Highness"", I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

This is the David Bowie's song

[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
Wе walked a million hills
I must have died alonе
A long, long time ago

Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold
If she floats then she is not
A witch like we've thought
A downpayment on another
One at Salem's lot

Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore

[Verse 2]
As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a sister
But instead, I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
Haven't thought before

I can't hide, no, on the mantle
I'm not sad until I'm home
It's the season, I'm all reason
I have seen all I have grown

I'm a lantern, I'm a planter
I set something in the garden
In the handle, on the mantle
I love Santa, I met God

A chase would be nice for a few

I can't hide, no, on the mantle
I'm not sad until I'm home
It's the season, I'm all reason
I have seen all I have grown

Cheat on me

Cheat on me
And not seen

I'm a lantern, I'm a planter
I set something in the garden
In the handle, on the mantle
I love Santa, I met God

Cheat on me

Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need

One baby to another says, ""I'm lucky to have met you""
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[Verse 2]
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth

[Chorus]
And I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

[Chorus]
And I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We'll make a pact to learn from who
Ever we want without new rules
And we'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way to prove they still
Smell her on you
They still smell her on you
Smell her on youEmbed"

That I ever had
Was when I learned
To cry on command
Love myself
Better than you
I know it’s wrong
So what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I’m on a plain

[Verse 2]
My brother died
Every night
It's safe to say
Don't quote me on that
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
The black sheep got
Blackmailed again
Forgot to put
On the zip code
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

As defense I’m neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

[Verse 3]
It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don’t make a sense
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
One more special
Message to go
And then I’m done
And I can go home
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong

They live a lifestyle that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make a living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they would come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battleground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show

[Chorus]
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart

And you're gonna wish that you did
Gonna retire on the profits
First off, I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf

And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf

I've accumulated over the past 62 years

Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood
And cut them up into two by two feet squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap
And I'm going to cut them into two by two feet squares
And then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach

And I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood

And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood

And taking all our toys away

And seeing an amend, it's...

Leaving in a dusty race

Get down a well
See her in a maze
Diggin' in her farm
Dealer is the same
Deal it in her eyes
Somewhere in a plain, me

Heat it up before she comes

We're rolling

One more day to complete my service

Wondering how I'm gonna find a way; it's over

One more time here to fade my servant

And I know a later time
We could lay here with you
Leave the soul

One more doubt here to claim my supper
I can have anything you want to

Breathe the way here with you
Dream the same on the dew

Take a moan on a man
Breathe the shame onto you
Breathe the lie

Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new, but the face the same as it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile

And you're gonna wish that you did
Gonna retire on the profits
First off, I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf
With my 800 dollar a month tax free Century21 shop
And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups
I've accumulated over the past 62 years

Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood
And cut them up into two by two feet squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap
And I'm going to cut them into two by two feet squares
And then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach
And I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood

And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood
And glue them onto the plywood and burlap
And sell 'em for lots of money
People will be paying top dollar
For my kids' new used new toys and clothing
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that piss-stained mattress
I've been sleeping on

He had removed us
All the styles of heresy
Finally he appeared unexpectedly

We're rolling

[Verse 1]
One more day to complete my service
One more high to decay my nervous
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way; it's over
One more debt to complete my service

And I know a later time
We could lay here with you
Leave the soul

Load up on guns, bring your friends

She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

A mosquito, my libido

Was when I learned to cry on command

It's safe to say, don't quote me on that

And made my way back home

For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills

Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers, and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills, and shake the many hands

[Chorus]
Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words

[Verse 2]
When you've finished with the mop, then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work, it was fun

[Chorus]
Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words

[Verse 3]
Many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
Some say it was Greenland, and some say Mexico
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon

They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

Lyrics[Intro]
Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening
What is it?
This was written by (what?) my favorite performer. Our favorite perfomer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
Oh and here's a donation basket for one supply of Leadbelly's guitar
Oh yeah, this guy representing the Leadbelly's estate wants to sell me Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000
Passing a basket
Yeah, I even asked David Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me. He wouldn't do it

[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 3]
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

Lyrics[Intro]
Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening
What is it?
This was written by (what?) my favorite performer. Our favorite perfomer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
Oh and here's a donation basket for one supply of Leadbelly's guitar
Oh yeah, this guy representing the Leadbelly's estate wants to sell me Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000
Passing a basket
Yeah, I even asked David Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me. He wouldn't do it

[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 3]
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through (Shiver for me)

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines the sun don't shine
I'd shiver... the whole night through

[Outro]

The killer woke up in Belgium
And he poured a lot of syrup on his waffles
And then he walked on down the hall
And he said, ""All I want, is to have some hash browns and some grits"" and then he walked on down the hall
And then he said, ""Listen, I've got a quarter in my pocket and I see that Waffle House jukebox and I'm gonna walk up to the coin slot"" and there’s a direct line between my eye and that coin slot, and I lift that quarter out of my pocket and I said, ""I wanna hear the Waffle House theme""
So I walked up to the jukebox and I said, ""Come on in,""

A witch like we've thought

One at Salem's lot

That legendary divorce is such a bore

As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead, I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore

Take a look at who you are
It's pretty scary
So silly
Well, it's revolting
You're not much
If you're anything

Take a step outside the city
And you turn around
Take a look at what you are
Well, it's revolting
You're really nowhere
So wasteful
So foolish
Poppycock

Who said ""Don't look back""?
Don't believe 'em
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant

What's a season in a right, if you can't have anything?
What's the reason in a rhyme, if a plan means anything?
What's the meaning in a crime? It's a fan if anything
Where's the meaning in a line? It's a brand, it's a brand
How a culture comes again, it's a plan of yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyway
They're only here to talk to friends, nothing new is everyday
You could shit upon the stage, they'll be fans
They'll be fans, they'll be fans
They'll be fans

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly!
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways!

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways!

It's not cold enough
Please put this end up
She is moving through
Can we show our faces now?

I'm not interesting
She's not turning green
Shameful as it seems
Can we show our faces now?

Endless climb
I am blind
Why can't I hear?
Color blind
Speaking a phrase
Instantly grown
I am blind
Waiting in line
