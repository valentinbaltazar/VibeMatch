It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade

There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)

To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans

So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)

Why?

[Verse 1]
Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

Tell them that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?

She's from a world of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime, little children laughing
I'm from a world of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking, she kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh

[Chorus]
I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who ran away (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I was the clown and she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work, but we took our chances
What I can't recall is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember all of those faces
And now, all I have is memories, oh-woah

[Chorus]
I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel (Ooh)

All along, I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword, it cuts you in its stab (Ah)
All along, I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask and you control your world
One is one, and two is doin' me
But to know ya good, you're nowhere next to me
I can't trust what you're doing to me
All I know is true, that you're damaging me, baby

[Refrain: Michael Jackson & Ryuichi Sakamoto]
(Now, the mask you're wearing) Heaven must be wary
(Is stoney and staring) You got me scared, girl
(Lines and tears, age and fears) Every year, yeah, that's good
(Growing old, passions cold) You got me scared, girl
(Now, the mask you're wearing) Heaven must be wary
(Is stoney and staring) You know what you did
(Lines and tears, age and fears) Every year, na-na-na
(Growing old, passions cold) Ayy-ayy-ayy

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You sit around and I watch your face
You try to feed the truth, but let them hide in place

So take off the mask, so I can see your face

More kick and stuff in the phones, I need it
More bottom and kick in the phones

[Verse 1]
Tell me what did your daughter say, d-d-dong dong say?
(Ah, all day) All of the time
Alright, I see, alright
All of the time
Where we go, on the winds, in the wild

[Verse 2]
She told me I was a lonely man and I felt sad
She called my name then she said, ""Hello""
All them who died
And I sit, in a cup, in a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems that you, dun ber ber ber lee
Har-har thin walla man
Papa say, ""It doesn't care for what you do""
Careful what you do
Buttercup a day, hey hey hey!

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl that says that I am the one (do you know?)
The kid is not my son
Hey, hey, hey

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Verse 1: Akon]
I met her on the walkway
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me sideways and said
I can't help but to ask
I said, ""You wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'""
We end up goin' back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit it off until the morning
You heard her say

The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?) does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell them that it's human nature

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

[Chorus: Michael Jackson, will.i.am]
The girl is mine (She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
Uh, she like the way I rock
The way I rock

I know she's mine (She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
Uh, she like the way I rock

Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Don't waste your time
Your time, don't waste your time, don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he (Take you anywhere)
Well, I love you endlessly (Loving we will share)
So come and go with me to one's town
But we both cannot have her
So, it's one or the other

Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she says I blow her mind

[Verse 5: will.i.am]
She love the way I love her low, the way I love her high (Love her high)
She loves to say hello and never say goodbye (Say goodbye)
I call her mommy and she call me papa
I'm sorry Mike, but she love the way I rock her
And you know, you know, you know, I really care
And she know, she know, the love is right here
And I know, I know, the love is real true
And now they know, they know, just how they really do

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize therе's nowhere left to run
You feel thе cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind

There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen

Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)

[Intro]
Who will dance on the floor in the round
How she caused a scene, Billie Jean
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

To pursue her movie star dreams, ah
Ah, and she's giving hot tricks to men, just to get in
She was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time, that means
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]

[Verse 3: Taryll Jackson & Michael Jackson]
She gave up her life (Ooh) to follow her dreams (Chance again, babe)
Left behind everything for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad (Woo!)
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality for Ms. Hollywood (Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned
In her painted-on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the bein' in love that makes me cry, cry
You've got me fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time, I'm trying not to go too far, 'cause

[Pre-Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doin' someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry

Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet, my heart is sayin', ""Come and do me""

Now, we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be
But here I go fallin' again

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark

But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike

And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand

You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)

All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night

And share a killer, thriller (Ow)

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller89Embed"

I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)

Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

Tell them that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?

Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)

Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time

Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

This time is forever, love is the answer

You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing

Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson, Siedah Garrett & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, ""I do"" (I do)
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

This is my life and I want to see you for always

(Oh, no)
(Oh, no, no)

[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says ""There's no turning back""
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star""

'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright""

[Pre-Chorus]
Diana walked up to me
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight""
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright""

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?

So they came in to the out way
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

You've got world hunger
Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me
You've got school teachers
Who don't wanna teach
You've got grown people
Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ah, but there's no cure
You got many doctors
That aren't so sure
So tell me

She's got the look, she's so fine
And you know damn well the girl will be mine
She's got the breaks, she's the scene
And you know damn well she gives it to me
Uh-huh!
Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater
I know the girl is fakin' 'cause
I've seen her look better
She's composition, she's statistical fact
Got it ready for the willing
Got it kicking in the back
She's got the look

Come to the place, shocktacy
And you know damn well you know what I mean
Hot in the face, one to three
Like a pleasure trip like you've never seen
Uh-huh!
Satin lace and a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
'Cause she knows she looks hot
She's got position, she's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case

I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?

[Verse 1]
I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now, I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie? (Is it just a lie)
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (Make a dream come true)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

[Verse 2]
I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still, you said goodbye (Still, you said goodbye)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I let her get away
Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I got the feeling trouble's gotta stop
I got the feeling she's never gonna drop
I got the feeling she's never gonna stop
I got the feeling but she's never gonna know
My friends thought she's gonna like it
I got the feeling but she's never gonna take it
I got the feeling her head's all fucked up
I got the feeling she's out to play

[Break]
(Can't let go, oh)
I got to let go, I got a feeling but she's never gonna let me
(Can't let go, oh)
Gotta see her, how are they gonna stop me?

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]

Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel

And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]

Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time

Tell me what will I do?

She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throws it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

[Verse 2]
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?

Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muss er wohnen

[Verse 1]
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Verse 2]
Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end
But I'm only human

Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow

And you can say the words like you understand

Swim the deepest sea, hee

To get your dreams up off of the ground, ah

Before your confidence will win out

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl, I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

KGB was doggin' me (Hee)
(Take my name and just let me be)

Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

[Verse 1]
So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church and read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now, you're wearing a badge, you're called the ""Just Few""
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you, my friend, but

[Pre-Chorus]
If you show me the cash, then I will take it
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

[Verse 2]
Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers
[Pre-Chorus]
If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)

I don't think so

If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If it's dealing with God, then you will hell Him

Hoo!

[Verse 1]
Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearnin'
I promised I would never ever be returnin'
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearnin', hee, hee!
As we walked into the room, there were faces
Starin', glarin', tearin' through me
Someone said, ""Welcome to your doom""
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me, this is scarin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
We walked up the stairs still concealin' gloom
There were two girls sittin' in my room
She walked up to my face, said ""This is the place
You said, ""Meet you right here at noon"" (Uh!)

[Chorus]
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel

Thought in beguile to hurt me, this is scarin' me
Then the man next door had told
""She's been here in tears for fifteen years"", this is scarin' me

We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
Found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue, every girl that I knew
And my baby said, ""Love is through"" (Uh!)

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
[Chorus]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow)

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)

The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist

Who's watching?
Tell me, who's watching?
Who's watching me?

[Verse 1: Rockwell]
I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in The Twilight Zone? And

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Rockwell]
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy (Oh-oh-oh)
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Tell me, is it just a dream?

[Verse 2: Rockwell]
When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me, or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much, that's why

Well, is the mailman watching me? (Tell me, who's watching?)

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl, I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

""And don't you pretend you never did me before""

With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't you) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind

I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby!
[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

[Chorus]
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

That you can get to me with anything?
Seems like you'd know, by now, when and how I get down
And with all that I've been through, I'm still around

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Don't you ever make no mistake, baby, I got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get me (Come on, now)
And why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be
See, I'm too much for you, baby (Take on)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cuse I'm unbreakable

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly .9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack baggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert E's, street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil, what?

I've got to get away, so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes

Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to find a place, but I won't hide away

Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh, yes, I did forget something, didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster

[Verse 1]
You're fearing me 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream, it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks, she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

[Verse 2]
You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink, I'll disappear, and then, I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me
(No, no)
You might also like[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened

[Verse 3: Rod Serling]
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never-Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (No, no, baby)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks, she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be, so you should be threatened

(E-e-e-e threatened)
(While you sleep)
(E-e-e-e threatened)

[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (No, no, know it)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks, she speaks to me, threatened (She speaks to me)
Half of me, you'll never be, so you should feel threatened (And you, hoo-hoo!)

While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (You should be, hoo-hoo!)
Every time your lady speaks, she speaks to me, threatened (I said threatened) (Hoo-hoo!)

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know it's fled its tomb
Because now it's haunting me, I don't understand it!

[Refrain]
Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

[Verse 2]
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!

[Refrain]
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls (Hey!)
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
(Don't understand it!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya? (I'm sayin'!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it (I said)

Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?

Alone tonight
Begin tonight
Till it's all right
Damn lover friend of mine

[Verse 1]
She got your number, she know your game
She put you under, it's so insane
Since you seduced her, how does it feel
To know that woman is out to kill?

[Chorus 1]
Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number, and Susie says it's right

[Post-Chorus]
Susie says it's, Su-Su says it's
(Take my-Take my money)
Susie got your, Su-Susie got your
(Throw my time away)
Blood is on, is on, blood is

The dance floor, the dance the night
(You're damn, damn good for me)

Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel

[Chorus 3]
Ten years ago today
Dangerous, and Susie ain’t your friend
Dangerous, with seven inches in
Dangerous, blood is on the knife
Dangerous, and Susie says it's right

[Verse 3]
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart

[Chorus 4]
So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around
[Chorus 5]
It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side
It was blood on the dance floor, like it was love and true romance
It was blood on the
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it

I told you that you sure looked good, now

Time's moving too fast for us

Reaching out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

[Verse 2]
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Oh, why?
Why? Oh, why?

[Verse 3]
Reaching out... across the nighttime
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
Thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh, baby, ooh!

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

And no one's gonna save you
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

Inside a killer, thriller, aaow!

[Bridge: Vincent Price]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
Thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Hoo-hoo-hoo!)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
Thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

I just want to lay next to you for a while
Dedicated for this song to all of the people from Japan, for my dear friend, Yoshiaki
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me

[Verse 1: Michael & Sheryl]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, ""I do""
""I do""
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
[Bridge: Michael & Sheryl & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, ""Hey, Farewell"" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Oh, my love)
I just can't stop loving you (Oh, my love)
And if I stop

As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, and got out
And looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, ""Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there""
Oh

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I seen beautiful city appear
Of where kids are playing and people are laughing
And smiling and nothing to fear
She said, ""This is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down at my eyes, and they started crying
And grabbed my hand, you've got a friend""

She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave? Oh

She dances in his sheets at night

She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food

[Bridge]
She works so hard just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Yet she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Ah, I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

[Chorus]
She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me

[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man (Ah, ah)
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)

Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

[Hook 2]
And I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

As I drove across on the highway, my Jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped
Then got out and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, ""Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there""

[Chorus]
Oh, take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to (Oh) a place without (Yeah) no name

[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, ""This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness""
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh

She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave?
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world, oh

And he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, ""What's goin' on?""
Mother cries desperately, ""Our little baby's gone""

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock

Just imagine how scared they are

Sayin' that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone, somewhere out on the street

Escape (Ow!)
Escape (Ow!)
Escape

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away, so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter where I am, I see my face around
They pin lies on my name, then push them town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to find a place, but I won't hide away

[Chorus]
Escape (Escape)
I gotta get away from a system
Loose in the world today
Escape (Escape)
The pressure that I face from relationships
Had to go away
Escape (Escape)
The man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man

But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to? (Oh)

Ah, I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

[Chorus]
She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me

[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man (Ah, ah)
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)

Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)

As I drove across on the highway, my Jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped
Then got out and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, ""Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there""

[Chorus]
Oh, take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to (Oh) a place without (Yeah) no name

[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, ""This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness""
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh

She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave?
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world, oh

She dances in the sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus]
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
""Sir, I must be home tonight""
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be out her mind

[Bridge]
She works so hard just to make a way
For a man to just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still, she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance, she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed the pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, ""What's goin' on?""
Mother cries desperately, ""Our little baby's gone""

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street

Sayin' that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

[Chorus 2]
And I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do

[Bridge]
It seems you don't know, we reached the highest mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, oh-hooo
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do
So I stopped and got out
And looked down, I noticed I'd got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange, feeling like a mist
I walked down toward the end of a road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, ""Don't you worry my friend
I'll take care, take my hand
I'll take you there""

[Chorus]
Ooh-oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
A'Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and a'smilin' an' Nothin' to fear
She said, ""This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness""
She turned around, looked down
In my eyes and started cryin'
And grabbed my hand
You've got a friend
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Woh-oh-oh
Yeah, doggone, oh-oh

[Verse 3]
She started likin' me
Kissin' me, and huggin' me
She didn't really really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world, could I wanna leave

[Pre-Chorus]
So then I went in my pocket
Took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought
You could be in another world

She swore she'd dance no more
But dance, she did, she dare'd not quit

Father runs to the table, he says ""What's going on?""
Mother cries desperately, ""Our little baby's gone!""

Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusin' her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive? She ain't got nothin' to eat

Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me sideways and said

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'

We end up goin' back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit it off until the morning
You heard her say

Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
But baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Verse 2]
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
And for this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere just as long as you were there

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away

Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

All alone, wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night, I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart, you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars, I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you

[Spoken (E.T.)]
Thank you

Promise me we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart, you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
Oh, I believe you and I could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see

Sister don't read, she'll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian song
What do we care if she runs away?
What about love?
What about all I pray?
Go through the words, she knows a priest
What about God?
Living is all I see
What will you care, think she will say?
What about love?
That's all I pray

[Chorus]
Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I’d like to have my child

[Verse 2]
Sister confused, she went along
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding her time, breathing the words
Singing a song, reciting a Bible verse
Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse
What about all I've seen?
You know the line, you came alone
What about heart?
That’s all I've known

Think about life, I'd like to have my child
(chh chh - chh chh chh)
(chh chh chh)

[Verse 3]
Look at my words
What do they say?
Look in my heart
Burning is all heartbreak
What do you get?
What do you say?
What about love?
I feel my sin

[Chorus]
Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers (Ooh!)
Think about life, I'd like to have my child
(Ooh!) (chh chh - chh chh chh) (Ooh!)
[Bridge]
She could have been grateful
Where will she go?
What will she do
Through the world?

[Verse 4]
Sister don't know, where will she go?
What about love?
What about all I saw?
What will you care?
Don't be so confused
Love all the things
It's just the things I do

You're the one that I adore, you
Give me one and don’t adore me
Tell me things you all believe I do
All the things I wanna say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Yesterday was when I felt down
And you came with my stuff and put fate on the ground
And you have to say that you looked at me
Obviously, I do
That's why I want to be

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine

[Verse 2]
You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make you think that I was around
You know, life was just a thing, she don't pass the way I do

I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't be feelin' your pain

[Chorus]
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' your pain
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain

[Verse 2]
I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every move
""Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine""
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn 'round fast, but too bad
They know your every move

You won't live a quiet life

[Chorus]
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
Father never lies (The price of fame)
My father never lies
My father never lies (The price of fame)
So don't be feelin' this way, boy

[Instrumental Break]
Hee-hee
Aow!
Do it, ooh!

[Verse 3]
I like to take some time and get away, then they say
Is that boy still alive?
The weak that really start takin' pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive
[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They start to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel the envious look at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Well, then, stand here in my shoes
And get a taste of my blues

[Chorus]
It’s the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Siedah Garrett, Siedah Garrett]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson, Siedah Garrett & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, ""I do"" (I do)
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong

Cuando amanece tu amor aparece y me hace feliz

Tú me haces sentir deseos de vivir, junto a ti por siempre, tu amor es mi suerte
Tu voz me llama, tú eres quien gana en mi corazón
Porque me has dado algo sagrado con tu pasión
Me conoces bien y sabes también, que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estás no hay felicidad, mi vida no es vida si tú te vas

You can't win, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
People keep saying things are going to change
But they look just like they're staying the same
You can't win, way over your head
And you only got yourself to blame

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You can't win, child
You can’t break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, the world keeps moving
And you're standing far behind
People keep saying, things will get better
(Just to ease your state of mind)
(So you lean back)(And you smoke that smoke)
(And you drink your glass of wine)

If your story stays the same
(You ain’t winning) No, no
(But it's nice to see you, I'm awfully glad you came)
(Better cool it, 'cause it ain't about losin')
Then the world has got no shame

[Chorus]
You can't win, child
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, you can't break even
Ain’t the way it's supposed to be
(You'll be spending) No, no, oh

While someone else rides for free
(Learn your lesson) Hoo-hoo!
(Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame)

The break's on me then what do you get

Alone she lies waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the room
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon

And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon

And it shows that we must heed instead

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Verse 2]
Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call

Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, i didn't do that

[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
She never knew but I was walking the line
She never thought that I would have the time
She'd never feel that I was going alone
She never thought and then she hang up the phone

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion of my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine
You might also like[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 2]
She never thought that I was walking the line
She'd never feel that I would have the time
She never thought that I was going alone
She came to me and then she hang up the phone

Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

I have to pray to god, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine
(But you're no, but you're no)
(But you're no, but you're no)
(But you're no, but-)

[Bridge]
Da da, she tried to ruin my reputation
Da, she goin' around, he was the voice of information
That baby got me callin' away, and was the secrets in the constellation

And then it happened
She touched me

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her innards bitter than wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

[Verse 3]
She never thought that I was walking the line
She'd never feel that I could have the time
She never thought that I was going alone
She came to me, and then she hang up the phone

I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself

Did she find in someone else?

I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside a dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see, what will I do?
[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

It is a friend of mine?

Never try to talk about it
It's got to sound good to me inside
I have to think about it

[Verse 1]
I'm so undemanding
'Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside

The truth is that I'm longing
A love that's so divine
I've searched this whole world wishing
She'll be there time after time

[Chorus]
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

[Verse 2]
I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains
You might also likeI'll be your story hero
I'll serenade in rhyme
I'm just needing that someone
Save me now from the path I'm on

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

[Bridge]
When you say we will dance 'til the light of day
It's just like the children running with joy
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone

No sense pretending it's over
Hard times just don't go away
You got to take that chip off your shoulder
It's time you open up, have some faith
Nothing good ever comes easy
All good things come in due time, yes it does
You got to have something to believe in
I'm telling you to open your mind

[Chorus]
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

[Verse 2]
You see yourself in the mirror
And you don't like what you see, ooh
And things aren't getting much clearer
Don't you think it's time you go for a change, oh!
Don't waste your time on the past, no, no
It's time you look to the future, oh
It's all right there if you ask
This time if you try much harder
You will be the best that you can be, ooh!

Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
Something about you, the stare in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul

And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside!

Helpless like a baby

Bringing sparkles to your eyes

Who is special in her heart

Saying that she's yours, not mine

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time

There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)

Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Siedah Garrett, Siedah Garrett]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson, Siedah Garrett & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, ""I do"" (I do)

(Oh, no)
(Oh, no, no)

[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says ""There's no turning back""
She trapped me in her heart

So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal hat, the man is Mike, so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle

Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me
You've got school teachers
Who don't wanna teach

Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ah, but there's no cure
You got many doctors

So tell me

[Verse 1]
I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now, I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie? (Is it just a lie)
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (Make a dream come true)

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday

[Verse 2]
I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still, you said goodbye (Still, you said goodbye)

Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

Think about, um, the generations and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and our children's children, so that they, they, they s—they know it's a better world for them, and think if they can make it a better place...

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & The John Bahler Singers]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race (Oh, no)
There are people dying (Oh)

It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale

I've seen the bright get duller

I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever and a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl, I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said ""You know my name""
(She called me!)
""And don't you pretend you never did me before""

With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't you) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

[Ad-Libs]
Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

[Bridge]
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby!
[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

[Chorus]
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

What about killing fields? Is there a time?

Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day
My heart was yearning
I promised I would never ever be returning
When my baby broke my heart and left me yearning, woo
As we walked into the room
There were faces staring
Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me, hoo

[Pre-Chorus]
We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls
Sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
Said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon

In beguile to hurt me
Then the man next door had told

Found that wicked women
Run this strange hotel

Each time the wind blows

You are my choice now

At your call I hear harps
And angels sing

That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, ""There's no turnin' back""
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no

Oh no, oh no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star""

[Verse 3]
She said, ""I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said, ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright""
Diana walked up to me
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight""
I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright
But unlock the door
Because I forgot my key""
""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me""

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their need?

[Pre-Chorus]
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Nanana, nanana, nana, nana, uh-huh

I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?

[Pre-Chorus]
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind you see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Oh)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Oh)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that, change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (You better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
[Bridge]
You gotta get it right
While you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart
You can't close your, your mind
That man, that man (Man in the mirror), that man (Oh yeah)
That man, that man, that man, that man
(I'm asking him to change his ways - you better change)

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)

And no message could have been any clearer

Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

So take your weight off of me

I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

She's saying ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please

She's touching me so to start
She says ""There's no turning back""

No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby
All is goin' my way

Sister don't read, she'll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian song
What do we care if she runs away?
What about love?
What about all I pray?
Go through the words, she knows a priest
What about God?
Living is all I see
What will you care, think she will say?
What about love?
That's all I pray

What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding her time, breathing the words
Singing a song, reciting a Bible verse

Brother's in curse

I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't be feelin' your pain

[Chorus]
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' your pain
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain

[Verse 2]
I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every move
""Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine""
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn 'round fast, but too bad
They know your every move
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
Father never lies (The price of fame)
My father never lies
My father never lies (The price of fame)
So don't be feelin' this way, boy

Is that boy still alive?

Only the strong survive

Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They start to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel the envious look at me

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Treatin' me bold and cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled your knife
She should have spied down his skin
Now, it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a madman's out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her 'bout us
No one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Ho!

Aaow!

[Chorus]
I'm heading for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matter
I've got to be on time
And nothing going to stop
Aren’t no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway
I got to really burn this road

Because

(Speed demon)
Speeding on the freeway, got to get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway, got to have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone

[Verse 1]
You persuaded me to love you and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache, instead
Into your arms, I fell, so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waiting there

[Pre-Chorus]
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

[Chorus]
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone
You made me love you
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone

[Verse 2]
You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

[Verse 3]
Look at me
See what lovin' you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that, your love, I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart cries out for your touch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

[Chorus]
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone

Go face the worries of the day

Turn each problem into play

Just being alive makes it all so very clear

As a sunny, sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
Take life easy, so easy, nice and easy
Like a child, so gay and so carefree
Yeah

Many of our world's problems today
Are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them
The magic, the wonder, the mystery, and the innocence of a child's heart
Are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world
I really believe that

[Verse 1]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

[Chorus]
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?

[Spoken Interlude]
When I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature
I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents
What we need to learn from children isn't childish
They know the way to summon things that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts
You might also like[Chorus]
People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood (Childhood) I've never known

[Verse 2]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

[Outro]
Have you seen my Childhood?Embed"

Someone said, ""Welcome to your doom""
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free

[Verse: Michael Jackson]
I never knew but I was walking the line (Hee)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee hee)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee)
My baby cried, she left me standing alone (Hee hee)

Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Intro: Michael Jackson & (The Jackson 5)]
Uh-huh huh huh
Let  me tell ya now, uh-huh
(Mmm,  mhm)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But  someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now  it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & (The Jackson 5)]
Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To  show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart?
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But  now, since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)

[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson & (The Jackson 5)]
Yes, I do now

Ooh, ooh, baby

Human Nature

[Verse 1]
Looking out
Across the night time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the night time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

[Spoken Intro: Haunted Voice]
I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air?
'Cause they're hiding everywhere

(Aaaahhh!)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is it scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby

{Sorcery...Illusions...}

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
[Interlude: Michael Jackson]
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I always feel like somebody's watching me

[Interlude: Rod Serling]
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Never Land, that's the place
A monster, that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing you could fear

[Part 2: Threatened]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
All hail, the king has risen
All hail, hail, the king, hail, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, king, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, the king has risen

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
[Chorus: Michael Jackson, 50 Cent]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
(Ooh hoo, come on, baby)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (Yeah)
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
(The king has risen)

[Outro: Rod Serling]
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't - it's the beginning

Ooh, uh, it's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, OW!

I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Bridge: Vincent Price & (Michael Jackson)]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe, ooh)
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

All the world must come together
Face the problems that we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor
She said later
What has come of all the people
Have we lost love of what it's about
I have to find my peace
'Cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother there'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day like it's the last

Planet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you

[Verse 1]
What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?

All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me but it's hard to see
'Cause when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me

[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
If you can't answer
You know me, hee

She was there, just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered, ""No"" to me
Well, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered, ""No"" to me
Well, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

Take away this never-ending sorrow
Take this lonely feelin' from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would fill with gold
Da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 3]
I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me

Who will dance on the floor in the round?""

Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)

But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time

This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

'Cause I can thrill you more

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

She's saying ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star""

She said ""I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright""

[Pre-Chorus]
Diana walked up to me
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight""
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright""
I said ""But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key""
She said ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me""

Ow!
Cha!
Shoo-ca-choo-ca!

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

Will you tell us that you're okay?

Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom

So they came in to the out way
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, ""I ain't second to none""

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff

Go when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Go when the going gets mean

[Verse 3: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from, it's where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee)
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

There's something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

She's just a lover who's doin' me by
It's worth the givin', it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it
She wants to give it

For now, we'll make a vow to just keep it in the closet

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me
Oh, love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me
[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to the fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
I'd like a lady
Talk to me, baby
Give in to me
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Love is wrong
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
Give in to the feeling9Embed"

I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever and a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

[Post-Chorus]
Who is it?
Is it a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me for such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see, what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune
Still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

[Post-Chorus]
Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, we never were
Just won't stop

It is a friend of mine?

To me, I'm bothered

Did she find in someone else? (Can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding 'round
Like a child, but pardon me

[Chorus]
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

[Verse 2]
Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself ""How did love slip away?""
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

I was wanderin' in the rain
(Mask of life feelin' insane)
Swift and sudden fall from grace
(Sunny days seem far away)
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
(Stalin's tomb won't let me be)
On and on and on, it came
(Wish the rain would just let me—)

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone and you're cold inside?

[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
(Armageddon of the brain)
KGB was doggin' me (Hee)
(Take my name and just let me be)
But then a beggar boy (Hee) called my name
(Happy days will drown the pain)
On and on and on, it came and the rain
And again, and again
(Take my name and just let me)

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know it's fled its tomb
Because now it's haunting me, I don't understand it!

[Refrain]
Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

[Verse 2]
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!

[Refrain]
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls (Hey!)
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?

And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night, I kissed our love goodbye

[Hook: The Jacksons]
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow, it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

The devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Come into me, I know mystical garden
Orchards and violets, all mysteries are parted
Life is a mirage ghost, imagination
Pure inspiration called justification

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Nothing's impossible, nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head?
Who creates these wonders like nobody can?

[Chorus]
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
I'm gonna Siegfried & Roy

[Interlude]
When it's Siegfried & Roy, it's the mind over magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game in the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

[Verse 2]
Move of the head and I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear, from euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening, nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Seeing black panthers that suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time

There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)

For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know it's fled its tomb
Because now it's haunting me, I don't understand it!

There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!

Think about, um, the generations and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and our children's children, so that they, they, they s—they know it's a better world for them, and think if they can make it a better place...

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Make it a better place

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel

Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing

I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)

There is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Verse 2]
Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call

Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, i didn't do that

So let's start giving, let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking, taking
We're taking our own lives

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl, I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness

I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (Hee)
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey (Yeah, uh)
Woo (Uh-uh), woo
Woo

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (Hee)
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (Ooh)
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice (Do think twice), woo
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo, my baby cried
His eyes looked like mine (Oh, no)
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (Hee)
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (Woo)
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops you hearts
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal hat, the man is Mike, so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle

Why?

[Verse 1]
Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?

Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

It was Sunday, what a black day

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Siedah Garrett, Siedah Garrett]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson, Siedah Garrett & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, ""I do"" (I do)
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
[Chorus]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow)

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)

The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)

I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""

Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)

And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!
[Outro]
Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)

Do it one more time. I sung the wrong lyrics

[Chorus]
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years, she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

[Bridge]
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned, love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

[Chorus]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my lifeYou might also likeEmbed"

A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth, are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart soft and blue
Do you care?
Have you a part?
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood
Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now
Planet Earth are you just floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart gentle and blue
Do you care?
Have you a part?
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love youYou might also like3Embed"

Sit yourself down, take a seat

Woo! Oh, sounds like beauty, doesn't it?
MJ, DJ Cassidy, oh

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be it
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit
When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & The Jackson 5]
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or someday you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

[Bridge: Michael Jackson, Jermaine Jackson]
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed
They'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name to dirt, oh

Isaac said he kissed you
Beneath the apple tree
When Benji held your hand he felt
Electricity
When Alexander called you
He said he rang your chime
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your time

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & The Jackson 5]
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or someday you'll be all alone

And then one day, you get it
It's so good to you
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now, I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause ooh

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away

And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away, hey

Wonder if she's gone to stay

Uh-huh huh huh huh

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now, it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Jackson 5]
Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now, since I see you in his arms (I want you back)

[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson & Jackson 5]
Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na

Tryin' to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Followin' the girl, I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now

You crossed your heart you'd quit

When we grew up, you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now, just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

Stop! The love you save may be your own

Ooh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in May
I bumped into you at the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye-bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry

[Chorus]
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah

When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know it's fled its tomb
Because now it's haunting me, I don't understand it!

[Refrain]
Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

[Verse 2]
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!

[Refrain]
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls (Hey!)
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
(Don't understand it!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya? (I'm sayin'!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it (I said)

Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muss er wohnen

[Verse 1]
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Verse 2]
Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end
But I'm only human

Seems that the world's got a role for me

Hold me
Show me

In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow

Think about, um, the generations and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and our children's children, so that they, they, they s—they know it's a better world for them, and think if they can make it a better place...

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & The John Bahler Singers]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

So they came in to the out way
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you

Then tell me just what will I do

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until

There is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl, I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says ""There's no turning back""
She trapped me in her heart

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that

And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands

And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

Kept my love for her locked deep inside!

Because the doggone girl is mine

Well, I love you endlessly

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you do regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side (Blood on my side)
It seemed sincere while it was love and true romance
And now, she's out to get me
But I just can't take it, just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number, you know Susie says it right (Hoo-hoo!)
Susie got your number, Susie ain’t your friend
(Ah, it's goin' down, baby)
Look who took you under with seven inches in (She's stuck seven inches in)
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (It's goin' down, baby, ah)
Susie got your number, and Susie says it's right
[Post-Chorus]
It was blood on the dance floor (Ooh, blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor (Ooh, blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor (Ooh, blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor (Ooh, blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it
Hoo!

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (Hee)
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey (Yeah, uh)
Woo (Uh-uh), woo
Woo

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (Hee)
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (Ooh)
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice (Do think twice), woo
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo, my baby cried
His eyes looked like mine (Oh, no)
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (Hee)
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (Woo)

You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day you get it
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
Because ooh

[Verse 1]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she is away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she is always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

[Verse 2]
Wonder this time where she is gone
Wonder if she is going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know
I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone

[Verse 4]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes awayEmbed"

Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)

Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms (I want you back)
